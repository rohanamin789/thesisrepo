Apple's market value falls below R34 trillion,Bloomberg,2023-01-04 00:00:00,date,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/475343-apples-market-value-falls-below-r34-trillion.html,mybroadband.co.za,A continued slump in Apple shares caused the company's market value to drop below $2 trillion (R34 trillion).,"A steady slide in Apple Inc. shares pushed the iPhone maker's market value below $2 trillion (R34 trillion), the latest casualty in the tech stock rout.

Apple fell 3.7% on Tuesday, closing at its lowest since June 2021 as concerns about iPhone supply in the important holiday quarter mount and investors lose faith in a reprieve from higher interest rates.

The slump sent Apple's market value to $1.99 trillion, ending its reign as the last company to sport a $2 trillion valuation after Microsoft Corp. and oil giant Saudi Aramco retreated in 2022.

The milestone marks a fall from grace for Apple. The stock spent much of the past year outperforming the S&P 500 Index but has stumbled in recent weeks amid fears that iPhone production problems in China will ruin holiday sales, the company's most important period.

Exactly a year ago, Apple's shares briefly rallied to climb above $3 trillion (R51 trillion) in market value as the S&P 500 hit a record high.

The four largest US technology and internet companies lost more than $3 trillion in market value in 2022, amid soaring inflation and slowing sales growth that surged during the Covid-19 pandemic.

December was Apple's worst month since May 2019 with a decline of 12%, steeper than the 9% decline for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index in the same period.

iPhone Production Woes

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has suffered supply disruptions stemming from Covid-19 lockdowns in China, but those have been easing.

Manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology Group has brought the world's largest iPhone plant back to about 90% of anticipated peak capacity.

The Zhengzhou facility, known as iPhone City, produces the vast majority of high-end iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max devices.

In November, thousands of workers had fled or staged protests against extreme Covid rules. But Foxconn ended most of those restrictions last month and offered more incentives for both new and current employees.

Another Apple supplier, Murata Manufacturing Co., added a note of pessimism last month.

The company said it expected the tech giant to reduce iPhone 14 production plans further in the coming months. The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue.

'Judging by handset availability in stores, I see a downward revision happening,' Murata President Norio Nakajima said in an interview. 'I hope that it won't be too deep.'

Meanwhile, Nikkei reported on Monday that Apple had told several suppliers to make fewer components for some products, including AirPods, the Apple Watch and MacBooks, given weakening demand.

Apple is expected to deliver its latest quarterly earnings report in the coming weeks. The quarter that runs through December is its biggest sales period of the year, and analysts had initially projected record-setting revenue.

Now they're predicting a slight decline to $122.9 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

Underpinning Apple's valuation is the hope that the company still has major growth opportunities ahead.

Services have been a key area of expansion in recent years and now represent more than a fifth of revenue.

The company also is working on some big swings, such as a mixed-reality headset that could be unveiled as soon as this year and an electric vehicle.",mybroadband.co.za,11662,business,ZA,en,Bloomberg,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-logo-on-office-building_headline.jpg,False,@mybroadband,7.368962,a5842d4fbdf461e89c53b5e69e5da953

The fall meant that in just one year, the tech giant lost $1 trillion in market capitalisation.According to CNN, like many other tech companies, Apple has been hit by supply chain issues. Its manufacturing in China has taken a hit due to a fresh wave of Covid infections in the only major economy combating such a crisis. On January 3, Apple's shares were down by nearly 4 per cent after a report raised concerns about consumer demand for its products, according to the report. Nikkei Asia reported on Monday that Apple recently notified several suppliers to build fewer parts for some of its most popular devices for the first quarter, including AirPods, the Apple Watch, and MacBooks. Such reports have raised concern about demand for Apple products as well. However, Apple is not the only company to suffer a massive reduction in market capitalisation. While Apple's market value has declined significantly, other major technology companies have experienced steeper percentage declines. Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta's shares have fallen by about 50 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively, over the past year, said the report.

Apple CEO Tim Cook to take 40% pay cut this year,Patrick Mcgee,2023-01-13 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/01/13/apple-ceo-tim-cook-to-take-40-pay-cut-this-year/,irishtimes.com,iPhone maker says chief executive requested reduction after a drop in shareholder support of structure of equity awards,"Apple is targeting a more than 40 per cent cut to Tim Cook's pay package in 2023, it said, at the request of the chief executive following shareholder criticism.Apple's compensation committee decided to award Mr Cook total 'target compensation' of $49 million (€45.2 million), down from a target of $84 million (€77.5 million) a year before, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.Mr Cook's base salary was unchanged at $3 million (€2.8 million), as well as a bonus of up to $6 million (€5.5 million). But the targeted value of his equity award will fall from $75 million (€69.2 million) in 2022 to $40 million (€36.9 million) this year, according to Apple.The percentage of stock units granted to Mr Cook in his 2023 pay package linked to Apple's performance made up 75 per cent of his overall equity award, up from 50 per cent the year before, as some shareholders wanted Mr Cook's incentives more closely aligned with future growth.Apple said Mr Cook's pay package is within the '80th and 90th' percentile of CEOs relative to the company's peers.In recent years Mr Cook's net worth has ballooned to $1.7 billion (€1.6 billion), according to Forbes, thanks to his largely stock-based compensation as Apple shares had soared. His actual total pay in 2022 reached $99.4 million (€91.7 million), and $98.8 (€91.2 million) million in 2021, a 500 per cent increase from the $14.8 million (€13.6 million) he received the prior year.A majority of shareholders – 64 per cent – gave their approval in an advisory vote on Apple's executive compensation packages at its annual meeting last year, but the company noted in the filing that it represented a 'notable year-over-year decline, as our annual say on pay proposals have received much higher levels of shareholder support for many years.'Apple said that some shareholders who did not support Apple's executive pay packages 'consistently cited the size and structure of the 2021 and 2022 equity awards granted to Mr Cook as the primary reason for their voting decision'.But Apple said Mr Cook, the former operations chief who succeeded the late Steve Jobs as CEO in 2011, still had broad investor backing.It said: 'There was also overwhelming support for Mr Cook's exceptional leadership and the unprecedented value he has delivered for shareholders.'The company said in the filing the compensation committee's decision 'balanced shareholder feedback, Apple's exceptional performance and a recommendation from Mr Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received.'The filing notes Apple makes these decisions 'prior to the start of each fiscal year', which ended on September 24 2022.Apple has had a rocky few months following turmoil at factories in China, which resulted in it issuing a rare warning, on November 6, that iPhone production would face 'significant' disruptions in advance of the holiday season. Its shares have fallen more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months.Analysts have downgraded revenue forecasts for the December quarter – Apple's most lucrative period – with the consensus now anticipating revenues will not match the $124 billion (€114.4 billion) earned a year earlier.

Meta and Apple fall off Glassdoor's list of best places to work,,2023-01-11 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/2023/01/11/meta-and-apple-fall-off-glassdoors-list-of-best-places-to-work/,irishtimes.com,Website's annual survey comes amid widespread tech layoffs,"Glassdoor's list of 100 best places to work in 2023 is dominated by tech companies, but this year two regular winners didn't make the cut: Apple and Meta.More than 40% of the companies on this year's list are in the tech industry despite waves of lay-offs. Glassdoor, a platform for anonymous employer reviews, releases the annual list recognising standouts among US firms, many of which have large Irish operations, with more than 1,000 people based on feedback submitted by employees over the past year. Last year, Meta and Apple both came in around the middle of the top 100. The best company to work for is a new addition to the ranking: software company Gainsight.'Tech continues to be the best-represented industry on the list,' said Glassdoor's lead economist Daniel Zhao. 'But at the same time, tech has been on a roller coaster through 2022 with some companies falling off the list and others entering for the first time,' he said, 'It's a nice reminder that tough times often lead to a changing of the guard – companies that rely on old methods might fall by the wayside, and new companies often rise in times of crisis.'It's the first time Apple hasn't made the list since Glassdoor began releasing it in 2009. Meta has been ranked since 2011 and has held the number onespot three times, most recently in 2018. Alphabet's Google and Bain & Company are now the only two firms that have made the list every year for 15 years.Both Meta and Apple have faced challenges over the past year. The social media company has cut more than 11,000 jobs as it shifts focus to the metaverse. Glassdoor takes into account a company's business outlook, and the change in strategy has left employees feeling 'a little bit unsure of exactly how that's going to play out,' Zhao said. At the same time, lay-offs can devastate morale and do long-term damage to an employer's brand.For Apple, the return-to-office push may be to blame, according to worker reviews. 'Employees really do value the ability to work remotely or at least hybrid,' Zhao said. 'The push for return-to-office hasn't been received with open arms, we'll say.'Enter Gainsight, which builds platforms for customer service, product and community engagement. In their reviews, employees highlighted the company's transparent leadership, diversity and inclusion, career opportunities and flexibility – from remote work to unlimited paid time off. Founded in 2009, Gainsight provides software to hundreds of businesses and says it's remote-friendly and 'human-first.''In times of crisis, this is often an opportunity for these up-and-coming companies,' Zhao said.

Facebook and Apple no longer in top 100 places to work amid tech layoffs,Matthew Field,2023-01-11 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/11/facebook-apple-no-longer-top-100-places-work-amid-tech-layoffs/,telegraph.co.uk,Rows over working from home and layoffs dampen staff morale,"Facebook and Apple are no longer among the best places to work in Silicon Valley as a drumbeat of bad news and layoffs dampens staff morale.
Meta, which owns Facebook, and Apple have fallen out of the top 100 highest ranked places to work in the US, according to a ranking by jobs website Glassdoor.
The anonymous reviews website collates feedback from thousands of current and former staff at major companies, which are then published online.
While Meta, which rebranded from Facebook in 2021, had previously ranked highly due to its perks and pay, it has fallen out of the top 100 companies for the first time since 2011. Meta previously secured the number one spot on the list three times. However, in 2022 it dropped from ranking as number 11 to number 47.
Apple has also fallen out of the top 100 for the first time since the rankings began in 2009, amid a bitter row between staff and executives over working from home.
The iPhone maker has demanded staff return to the office three days per week, as of September. The decision led to multiple staff petitions, with some threatening to quit.
In November, Meta announced it would lay off 11,000 staff, around 13pc of its workforce. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, said the company had grown too quickly during the coronavirus pandemic.
The social media company has also suffered from a string of negative headlines amid scepticism over its efforts to launch the 'metaverse', Mr Zuckerberg's virtual reality vision for the future of the internet.
Meta's falling ranking came despite the tech company keeping in place a ""work from anywhere"" policy, which allows staff to request to relocate all over the world or work remotely. Mr Zuckerberg often works from his villa in Hawaii.
Google still managed to make the top 100 list, coming in as the eighth best place to work in the US, while Microsoft also made the cut.
The highest ranked firm in the US was Gainsight, a customer service technology company, which also got the top spot.
In the UK, consultancy giant Bain was most highly ranked. Google, Microsoft and Apple were ranked among the top 50 places to work in Britain.
Christian Sutherland-Wong, chief executive of Glassdoor, said: 'The past year brought extreme highs and lows for job seekers and employees.
'It's encouraging to see companies doubling down on employee mental health and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, competitive benefits and flexible work environments.'",telegraph.co.uk,123,business,GB,en,"Chris Price,Daniel Woolfson,Jeremy Warner,Matthew Field,Richard Evans",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2023/01/11/TELEMMGLPICT000275946271_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQ99bcywK3ovn70OLmYu7RuEMimd7DDz1yPby6vX5sLU.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,False,,6.776986,a2f43ddc78733732b0ec66f8a84818c3

How Apple bet the farm on China,Patrick Mcgee,2023-01-17 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/01/17/how-apple-bet-the-farm-on-china/,irishtimes.com,"The company spent two decades and billions of dollars building a supply chain of unprecedented sophistication. Now, a reckoning is coming","In 2007, Nokia had 900 million users. Its market dominance seemed so great that Forbes ran a cover story on the company asking 'Can anyone catch the cell phone king?' The same year, Apple launched the iPhone.Sixteen years and 1.2 billion users later, the story of how the Finnish handset maker got blindsided by the iPhone is well known. Nokia, the story goes, didn't have enough software savvy to keep up with visionary Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and design whizz Jony I've.But the cellphone's multitouch, full-screen features were not Apple's only advantages. The company was also outmanoeuvring Nokia on hardware and production before the iPhone even went on sale. And it did so by making a substantial bet on China and its manufacturing sector.Supply chain researcher Kevin O'Marah vividly remembers his confusion when, in mid-2007, Apple vaulted from out of nowhere into the No. 2 spot of the Supply Chain Top 25, an annual ranking of the world's best-run corporate supply chains.'Everyone was shocked,' he says. 'It was like, ‘What? This doesn't make sense. They have a terrible reputation.''The supply chain ranking turned out to be an early indication of a profound shift in operations at Apple, which held the No. 1 spot for the next seven years. In that time it became the world's most valuable company, while placing itself at the centre of geopolitical tensions.[ Apple chief Tim Cook to take 40% pay cut this year ]O'Marah began to learn that Apple was not really 'outsourcing' production to China, as commonly understood. Instead, he realised that Apple was starting to build up a supply and manufacturing operation of such complexity, depth and cost that the company's fortunes have become tied to China in a way that cannot easily be unwound.Over the past decade and a half, Apple has been sending its top product designers and manufacturing design engineers to China, embedding them into suppliers' facilities for months at a time.The relationship between Apple and Beijing has brought benefits for bothThese Apple employees have played integral roles co-designing new production processes, overseeing the minutiae of manufacturing until things were up and running, and keeping close tabs on suppliers to ensure compliance.Apple has also spent billions of dollars on custom machinery to build its devices, developing niche expertise that its rivals did not even know about, let alone compete with.It has transformed the company and the country. 'All the tech competence China has now is not the product of Chinese tech leadership drawing in Apple,' O'Marah says. 'It's the product of Apple going in there and building the tech competence.'These operations played such a salient role that the unassuming character behind them, chief operating officer Tim Cook, would succeed Steve Jobs as CEO in 2011. It was Cook who shifted Apple's production from the US to China, where he established unparalleled efficiencies that underpinned Apple's ascent.But this extraordinary success story has also created Apple's biggest vulnerability: its dependence on a single country, China, which under President Xi Jinping has grown increasingly authoritarian and estranged from the west.The manufacturing concentration is glaring for a risk-averse company widely lauded for leading the world in supply chain brilliance. More than 95 per cent of iPhones, AirPods, Macs and iPads are made in China, where Apple also earns about a fifth of its revenue – $74 billion (€68 billion) last year. That contrasts sharply with rivals such as Samsung, which have sharply cut back manufacturing in China.Even in recent years, as competition between Washington and Beijing has escalated sharply, Apple has continued to invest in China and further cement its connections with the country.The result is intense political scrutiny of Apple and its relationship with China, the country most in Washington consider to be America's principal rival. Cook and his company are now under intense pressure from investors and US politicians to 'decouple' from China and accelerate a diversification strategy that already has some products assembled in Vietnam and India.When it comes to finding suppliers, Apple follows a rigorous processApple declined to comment on this story. But interviews with 25 supply chain experts, including nine former Apple executives and engineers, suggest the iPhone maker has few viable paths out and none in the short term.And it's clear to those who know the company well where responsibility lies. 'Supply chain all goes back to one guy: Tim Cook,' says a former Apple veteran. 'This mess is his fault. This isn't just ‘the buck stops at the top', it's that ‘the buck stops with the guy who headed the supply chain.' And Tim is the master of supply chain.'Apple was far from the first computing company to offshore production to China. By the time Cook was lured to run worldwide operations in 1998, the likes of HP and Compaq were well established there.But Apple took advantage of the opportunities in unique ways. Instead of selecting components off the shelf, it used custom parts, designed the manufacturing behind them, and orchestrated their assembly into enormously complex systems with unprecedented scale and flexibility.In the supply chain rankings of 2007, P & , Toyota and Walmart all had a peer ranking score at least double that of Apple. But when it came to a supply chain metric called 'inventory turns' – a measure of goods sold versus inventories – Apple was in a league of its own.Cook had once described inventory as 'fundamentally evil,' likening electronics to dairy that would spoil in a few days. The results showed this was not a mere aspiration. Apple had 2.5 times better inventory turns than Nokia and was 12 times better than Coca-Cola.It also invested heavily in the production process to build moats around its manufacturing innovations, while rivals were just giving supplier spec sheets and saying: 'build this.''[Apple] were doing more capital equipment buying than anybody I could see in the world, and yet they were not owning it themselves – they were putting it in other people's plants,' O'Marah says.As iPhone production ramped up, the value of Apple's 'long-lived assets' in China – primarily equipment it uses in the production of devices – soared from $370 million in 2009 to $7.3 billion in 2012.These 'spectacularly significant' investments meant that by 2012, Apple's machinery in China had become more valuable than all of Apple's buildings and retail stores put together, according to Horace Dediu, a former Nokia executive who now runs the market intelligence group Asymco.Such vast sums enabled Apple to come up with production techniques that others could not imagine. In 2008, for instance, it launched a 'unibody' MacBook Pro made from a single block rather than multiple parts, a feat of industrial engineering offering 'a level of precision that is completely unheard of in this industry,' Jony I've said at the time.[ Apple brings more components in-house as it eases reliance on Samsung and LG ]This was accomplished using a CNC machine, which allows a designer with a 3D image file to create complex parts. These machines had been around for decades but, costing upwards of $500,000 each, were only used to build prototypes.Three former Apple manufacturing engineers say the company purchased more than 10,000 CNC machines, enabling a form of mass production that Steve Jobs called 'a whole new way of building notebooks'.Soon Apple was using the same technique for iPhones and iPads. According to two people involved, Apple made a deal with Fanuc, an automation group, to purchase its entire pipeline of CNC machines for years to come – and then it scoured the globe for more.Today, China accounts for 70 per cent of all smartphone manufacturing, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, and China sports a level of technical sophistication that multiple experts say they struggle to even comprehend'There were not enough CNC machines in the world to do the machining that we needed to do,' one person says. 'You have to understand that starting in 2009 we were growing exponentially. We'd go from building 10,000 parts a day one year, to 100,000 the next, and then 500,000, and then a million ... Money was no object, basically.'When it comes to finding suppliers, Apple follows a rigorous process.According to five people involved with Apple's tactics in China, it is typical for an Apple engineer from California to meet the CEO of a Chinese parts supplier, then pepper them with questions until their technical ability has been exhausted.The Apple engineer will then be brought to the next manager, and then the next, where the same thing happens until they have gone deep into the hierarchy, entering some windowless conference room in the basement where the person who actually wrote the line of code necessary to answer Apple's questions is located.After hours of interrogation, the Apple engineer will get the company to commit to building a custom part, in massive quantities, effectively taking control of the supplier's R & roadmap.One former Apple operations director says the company has consistently applied this approach, going back to 'first principles' to understand any hiccups in cost, design, and scaling possibilities.'There would be constant digging, because if you asked enough questions, then you could figure out what the constraint is – and then you could figure out how to get through it,' this person says. 'I never encountered a level of detail that Apple wasn't interested in.'This approach comes directly from Cook, says another former Apple executive. The CEO will demand no stone goes unturned even for a rivet costing fractions of a penny per device.Apple's production ingenuity has been amplified by a hierarchical government intent on creating jobs, developing expertise and winning the orders of multinational corporations'If you send him a pitch, he'll go into page 30, paragraph 7, and ask to talk in more details,' this person says. 'It's amazing how he can go from high-level to the very details, and back.'These techniques have allowed Apple to push suppliers beyond their perceived capabilities. As Apple grew, its leverage became ever greater: making a component that would be used in hundreds of millions of products was too good to pass up.Three former Apple veterans say they were floored by how much power they had in negotiations. 'It can really make you an asshole,' one says. 'People can tell you until they are blue in the face that they can't do what Apple is demanding, but when two people are both saying ‘no' to each other, someone is going to cave – and it's never Apple.'But a close relationship with Apple could be highly beneficial. The year Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn started assembling candy-coloured iMacs in 2000, it earned $3 billion in revenue – half that of Flextronics, a rival. By 2010, Foxconn revenues were $98 billion, more than its five biggest competitors combined.Apple's production ingenuity has been amplified by a hierarchical government intent on creating jobs, developing expertise and winning the orders of multinational corporations.Provincial governments in China have provided a vast array of preferential policies including important tax-exemptions, as well as apartment complexes to house migrants, warehouses, highways and airports.In 2009, Beijing orchestrated a staggeringly large fiscal stimulus. State-controlled banks issued $1.4tn of loans, with at least half devoted to infrastructure spending to secure the country's recovery after the global financial crisis.This coincided with a breakthrough design for the iPhone 4 and the unveiling of the first iPad, both in 2010.Foxconn won orders to assemble both products after founder Terry Gou had met with Tim Cook and told him he was underestimating demand, according to Alan Yeung, a former Foxconn official.'Terry basically said, ‘this is sandbagging – your numbers are way off,' Yeung says.Gou was so confident that he made a handshake pledge to build two new campuses – one in Zhengzhou, later known as 'iPhone City', and another in Chengdu, known as 'iPad City'.'Gou said, ‘Foxconn is going to underwrite the investment. I'll build two campuses with Chinese government partners. And when your volume is there, I'm going to build the products for you,' Yeung says.He was right. Annual iPhone shipments nearly quadrupled to 93 million from 2009 to 2011, while the first iPad shipped 15 million units in its first nine months.By October 2010, Foxconn's factories in Shenzhen alone had as many as 500,000 workers churning out products on gruelling schedules. When it emerged that year that more than a dozen employees had died of suicide at the facilities, Apple suffered international blame amid headlines about 'iSlavery.'Nevertheless, there was no shortage of workers applying to Foxconn. The trouble was retaining them, given the monotony of the work.Ken Moon, who teaches operations at Wharton, says worker turnover at Chinese contract manufacturers can exceed 300 per cent, or what amounts to 'replacing an entire factory workforce several times over, inside a year.'Apple itself estimates that since 2008 it has trained at least 23.6 million workers on their rights – more people than the total population of Taiwan.Beyond cheap cost, what Foxconn offered – at razor-thin margins below 3 per cent – was labour that was plentiful, close by, and structured to ramp production up whenever needed, but also to taper down, without Apple incurring costs, when it was not.China also offered labourers with specialised skill sets. Cook, explaining why Apple couldn't manufacture at scale in the US, once told an audience that if every tool and die maker in America were invited to the auditorium where he was speaking, they 'wouldn't fill the room.' Whereas 'in China,' he",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,Patrick McGee,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/h1p58SLoM41t2T_geI18RdegocM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/VDTXSXSC3HG2KQTT43WC7S7UIQ.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,8.356075,b3283a8b594df939355df2835b019e3e

Apple looks to scale up manufacturing in India: Piyush Goyal,Dt Next Bureau,2023-01-24 00:00:00,date,https://www.dtnext.in/business/2023/01/24/goyal-apple-looks-to-scale-up-manufacturing-in-india,dtnext.in,Goyal: Apple looks to scale up manufacturing in India,"NEW DELHI: iPhone-maker Apple is looking to scale up its manufacturing in India as the business environment is helping global firms make the country their base, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday.He said India offers a rule of law, and transparent government policies and business models which help it become a preferred destination for foreign investors.Talking about success stories of certain foreign companies, he said Apple already have about 5-7 per cent of their manufacturing in India. 'If I am not mistaken, they are targeting to go up to 25 per cent of their manufacturing. They launched their most recent models from India, manufactured in India.' The minister was speaking at the inaugural session of the B20 India Inception Meeting here, which was organised by industry chamber CII.Citing another example of a foreign company in the earth movers machine sector, the minister said that because of the competitiveness of India's manufacturing, that firm is supplying their products now to 110 countries at affordable competitive prices from India and also doing new launches.In November 2022, Telecom and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had said that the biggest unit to manufacture Apple iPhone in India is coming up at Hosur near Bengaluru, which will employ around 60,000 people.The company gets iPhones manufactured by electronics giants – Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron in India.When asked about the global economic uncertainties, he said that this would be a challenging year for the world.He said inflation in several countries is very high but in such a situation also, India has managed prices.During the tenure of this government so far, average inflation would be around 4.5 per cent, he said adding earlier 10-12 per cent of inflation was common.At a time when developed economies are facing slow down, the Indian economy is emerging as one of the fastest growing in the world due to steps taken by the Modi government, Goyal said.On increasing interest rates in the country, he said that the rates have increased recently due to the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic and war between Ukraine and Russia.'We believe that every strong step that we have taken to control inflation, RBI would keep that in mind and take steps,' he said.He further said that huge investment opportunities are there in the country.'There is no other market in the world as large as the India opportunity,' he said.'Hope businesses adopt a sustainable future in their practices & together we will draw up an agenda and use the B20 in India to look at how responsible businesses can raise the bar,' he added.Speaking at the event, G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant emphasised the need to make the global value chain more inclusive and resilient and that would require both decoupling and demonopolisation of these value chains.He said the world is impacted due to geopolitics, and there is a major crisis of fuel, food and fertiliser and rising energy prices in Europe.'Before we all face extinction, there is a need to go green and there is a need for major climate action, he added.He said it is in the hands of the private sector to shape the destiny of the world.'There is also a need for ensuring that the private sector steps up its act to accelerate investments across the world at this very crucial and critical juncture, Kant said.We must not lose Apple the way we lost Samsung to Vietnam: ICEA chairmanIndia Inc must create right space to bolster Apple manufacturing in the country, and the country should not lose the Cupertino-based iPhone maker the way it lost Samsung smartphone manufacturing to Vietnam, India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said here on Monday. Mohindroo said Apple, which is the most valuable company in the world, is welcomed here to manufacture its entire product line and 'it is in our great interest that we have their large manufacturing footprint'. 'I just hope India Inc acts together so that we provide the right space for them (Apple), because we lost Samsung completely to Vietnam,' he said. As Apple faces China disruptions amid Covid surge and supply-chain issues, several reports have surfaced that the Tim Cook-led premium smartphone maker will quickly shift some of its China manufacturing to India and Vietnam in the next 2-3 years.India is likely to produce 45-50 per cent of Apple's iPhones by 2027, at par with China, where 80-85 per cent of iPhones were produced in 2022. As per research analysts, India and Vietnam are to become the biggest beneficiaries of smartphone supply chain migration out of China.",dtnext.in,61939,business,IN,en,Dt Next Bureau,https://gumlet.assettype.com/dtnext%2F2023-01%2Ff07ecc9c-a7e1-4655-a92c-bf5f0a719406%2FUntitled_2_.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&enlarge=true,False,Dt Next Bureau,6.6585436,ae63f868b7ae388eb9250a7c805fd9d6

"Apple violated work rules, according to US labour watchdog",Patrick Mcgee,2023-01-31 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/01/31/apple-violated-work-rules-according-to-us-labour-watchdog/,irishtimes.com,US watchdog is recommending the iPhone maker settle with the former employees,"Apple has been found to have broken labour laws on multiple occasions following a year-and-a-half investigation stemming from former employees' complaints.The National Labor Relations Board in the US said there was sufficient evidence to support charges against the technology company after two employees accused it of workplace harassment and suppression of labour organising.The US watchdog is recommending the iPhone maker settle with the former employees. It will only take action to prosecute, in front of an NLRB administrative judge, if the parties do not settle. More than 90 per cent of companies settle. Bloomberg first reported the findings.The NLRB regional offices found merit to four charges that various work rules at Apple violated sections of the labour relations act because they interfered with 'employees in the exercise of their right to protected concerted activity', said spokesperson Kayla Blado.'Additionally, a regional office found merit to a charge alleging statements and conduct by Apple – including high-level executives – also violated the National Labor Relations Act.'One of the executives in question is chief executive Tim Cook, who in a September 2021 email to staff said: 'People who leak confidential information do not belong here.' Some employees protested, saying they had the right to speak about protected issues, including workplace harassment and pay transparency.Apple declined to comment. When the complaints first emerged in August 2021, the company said: 'We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.'After the Financial Times published a report in August in which 15 current and former female employees alleged retaliation for raising complaints to human resources, Apple acknowledged it had not always lived up to its own values.'There are some accounts raised that do not reflect our intentions or our policies and we should have handled them differently, including certain exchanges reported in this story,' Apple said at the time. 'As a result, we will make changes to our training and processes.'The five charges were brought by two former employees. Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer who left the company in November 2021, is behind three. Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager for six years who was fired in September 2021, brought the other two.'Having a government agency definitively say that this company broke the law in what they did really matters,' said Scarlett. 'This should help others feel empowered, to stand up for themselves and for others.'Apple is the biggest company in the world,' she added. 'It's important we hold them accountable.'Gjøvik, in a statement to the FT, added: 'Apple systemically uses their secrecy policies ... to cover up corporate malfeasance.'The NLRB has previously sided against Apple twice, finding merit against complaints that the company had suppressed unionisation attempts at its retail stores in Atlanta and New York.'These cases are tremendously important as Apple, being one of the world's largest companies, is also a significant employer,' said Kristin Hull, chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, an investment group that has fought Apple's use of non-disclosure agreements.'Apple also sets many standards for the tech industry as far as employment, policies and procedures,' she added.

Apple suffers 1st quarterly sales decline in nearly 4 years,Published Pm Pt Feb.,2023-02-02 00:00:00,date,https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/business/2023/02/02/apple-suffers-quarterly-sales-decline,spectrumnews1.com,Apple hasn't signaled any intention to mass layoffs,"Apple on Thursday posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years after pandemic-driven restrictions on its China factories curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season. The company's sales of $117 billion for the October-December period represented a 5% decline from the same time in the previous year, a deeper downturn than analysts had projected.
It marks Apple's first year-over-year decrease in quarterly revenue since the January-March period in 2019 when sales also slipped 5% amid slowing iPhone demand and the fallout of a trade war with China that was being waged by then-President Donald Trump.
Apple's profit also eroded during the past quarter, even though the Cupertino, California, company remained a pillar of prosperity. Earnings totaled $30 billion, or $1.88 per share, a 13 decrease from the same time in the previous year. Those results also missed a target of $1.94 per share set by analysts polled by FactSet Research.
Investors reacted to the letdown by initially driving down Apple's stock by nearly 5% in Thursday's extended trading. But management remarks made during a conference call with analysts raised hopes that Apple's disappointing performance may have been a mere hiccup, paring the decrease in the company's shares to less than 1%.
Apple's rare stumble came against a backdrop of renewed investor optimism about tech's outlook for this year, helping to spur a 17% increase in the sector's bellwether Nasdaq composite index so far this year.
But now Wall Street seems likely to reassess things in light of Apple's latest results and ongoing worries about a potential recession in the wake of rising interest rates aimed at tamping down inflation, said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.
With Google also disclosing a year-over-year quarterly decline in its digital ad sales on Thursday alongside Apple's disappointing performance, Cohen said it's clear there are 'several challenges the tech sector faces amid the current economic climate of slowing growth and elevated inflation.'
Despite the quarterly downturn in its fortunes. Apple hasn't signaled any intention to resort to mass layoffs — a stark contrast to its peers in technology. Industry giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms have announced plans to jettison more than a combined 50,000 employees as they adjust to revenue slowdowns or downturns caused by people's lessening dependence on the digital realm as the pandemic has eased.
'We manage for the long term,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during the conference call. 'We invest in innovation and people.'
Cook had tried to brace investors for tougher sledding in late October when he warned of 'increasingly difficult economic conditions' heading into the holiday season. Then, just a few days later, Apple cautioned that China's attempts to clamp down on the spread of COVID was affecting its production lines and would prevent meeting all the demand for the premium iPhone 14 models during the holidays.
That contributed to an 8% decrease in iPhone sales from the previous year to $65.8 billion in the most recent quarter.
Cook indicated Apple's supply headaches are now over, assuring analysts that 'production is now back where we want it to be.""
In another positive sign, Apple also disclosed that it now has more than 2 billion iPhones, iPads, Macs and other devices in active use for the first time. That is likely to help Apple sell more digital subscriptions and ads, helping to fuel long-term revenue growth.",mynews13.com,9350,business,US,en,"Associated Press,Published Pm Pt Feb.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/apple_store_customersap020223_02022023,False,,7.033325,fb801f7070661e1200e21640dd5b8ef9

Here's how Apple has avoided the mass layoffs gripping the tech sector,Saksha Menezes,2023-02-10 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/technology/big-tech/2023/02/10/heres-how-apple-has-avoided-the-mass-layoffs-gripping-the-tech-sector/,irishtimes.com,Mac and iPhone maker held off from the wave of hiring across the sector during the pandemic,"There's a reason why Apple is under less pressure than tech peers to slash jobs during the current slowdown: It hired more efficiently in the first place.
During the industry's pandemic-fuelled hiring binge, Apple added fewer employees than other big tech firms. On top of that, the company generated far more revenue per new hire than its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That more cautious approach is paying off now. Though Apple has frozen hiring in some areas and is keeping a lid on spending – especially outside research and development – it hasn't yet resorted to the mass lay-offs under way at Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms and other tech giants.
The company announced plans to shore up its human resources this week by hiring its first chief people officer. HR duties had been overseen by retail chief Deirdre O'Brien in a dual role.
Many tech companies admit that they hired too much during the pandemic, betting that lifestyle changes – including remote work, ecommerce spending and video-game habits – would bring a bigger windfall. Now they're dealing with the aftermath. Zoom, one of the biggest beneficiaries of Covid-19 lockdowns, just announced this week that it was cutting 15 per cent of its jobs.
Apple, meanwhile, was more cautious. Its headcount increased just 20 per cent from 2020 to 2022, compared with a 60 per cent gain at Alphabet and a near-doubling at Amazon. Those two companies went on to announce playoffs of roughly 30,000 combined.
Apple also generated much more revenue per additional employee during the pandemic years than it did in the previous three-year stretch. That's a sharp contrast with most of its technology peers.
However, headcount can't fully explain Apple's edge over competitors. The company also generates some of the highest sales per square foot – an indication that its efficiency goes beyond hiring policies.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett's company added to its already substantial Apple investment at the end of last year while slashing a new investment in computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor and two longtime bank holdings.
 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. revealed several changes to its stock portfolio in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday. Many investors follow the company's moves closely because of Buffett's remarkably successful investing record over the decades.
 
Berkshire picked up nearly 21 million more shares in the iPhone maker during the final three months of last year to give it 915.6 million shares at the end of 2022.
 
Buffett has called Apple one of the four giants that drive Berkshire's results even though it is only a stock investment. Berkshire's other main drivers are companies that it owns outright: its insurance unit that includes Geico, its energy company that owns several major utilities, and BNSF railroad.
 
During the quarter, Berkshire slashed its investments in Taiwan Semiconductor, US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon.
 
Just three months after revealing a 60 million-share stake in the chipmaker, Berkshire cut its Taiwan Semiconductor investment down to 8.3 million shares.
 
 
 
Berkshire also cut its US Bancorp investment drastically from 52.5 million shares to 6.7 million by the end of the year.
 
Berkshire Hathaway cut its investment in Bank of New York Mellon again and sold off more than 37 million shares during the quarter to leave it with just over 25 million shares of the bank.
 
The quarterly filings Berkshire submitted Tuesday don't make clear which investments Buffett is responsible for and which ones were made by the company's two other investment managers, but Buffett generally handles all of Berkshire's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. Buffett doesn't regularly comment on these stock filings.
 
Berkshire also added to one of its smaller investments that it first revealed three months ago when it picked up more than 1.2 million Louisiana Pacific shares to give it control of nearly 10% of that maker of building products.
 
 
 
During the quarter, Buffett continued to trim Berkshire's investment in Activision Blizzard to 52.7 million shares. He has said that he bought that stock as a way to bet that Microsoft's acquisition of the video game maker will ultimately go through.
 
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate Buffett leads also trimmed its investments in the grocer Kroger and Ally Financial.
 
Buffett's biggest investment over the past year in oil producer Occidental Petroleum remained unchanged during the quarter. Berkshire held 194.4 million Occidental shares and warrants to buy another 83.9 million shares at the end of the year.
 
Berkshire did pick up nearly 2 million more Chevron shares during the quarter to give it control of 8.7% of the oil giant.
 
 
 
One of the biggest changes in Berkshire's portfolio isn't reflected in the SEC filings because its investment in Chinese electric car maker BYD is held on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Since August, Berkshire has sold off 95 million of the 225 million BYD shares it bought back in 2008.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett's company added to its already substantial Apple investment at the end of last year while slashing a new investment in computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor and two longtime bank holdings.
 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. revealed several changes to its stock portfolio in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday. Many investors follow the company's moves closely because of Buffett's remarkably successful investing record over the decades.
 
Berkshire picked up nearly 21 million more shares in the iPhone maker during the final three months of last year to give it 915.6 million shares at the end of 2022.
 
Buffett has called Apple one of the four giants that drive Berkshire's results even though it is only a stock investment. Berkshire's other main drivers are companies that it owns outright: its insurance unit that includes Geico, its energy company that owns several major utilities, and BNSF railroad.
 
During the quarter, Berkshire slashed its investments in Taiwan Semiconductor, US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon.
 
Just three months after revealing a 60 million-share stake in the chipmaker, Berkshire cut its Taiwan Semiconductor investment down to 8.3 million shares.
 
 
 
Berkshire also cut its US Bancorp investment drastically from 52.5 million shares to 6.7 million by the end of the year.
 
Berkshire Hathaway cut its investment in Bank of New York Mellon again and sold off more than 37 million shares during the quarter to leave it with just over 25 million shares of the bank.
 
The quarterly filings Berkshire submitted Tuesday don't make clear which investments Buffett is responsible for and which ones were made by the company's two other investment managers, but Buffett generally handles all of Berkshire's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. Buffett doesn't regularly comment on these stock filings.
 
Berkshire also added to one of its smaller investments that it first revealed three months ago when it picked up more than 1.2 million Louisiana Pacific shares to give it control of nearly 10% of that maker of building products.
 
 
 
During the quarter, Buffett continued to trim Berkshire's investment in Activision Blizzard to 52.7 million shares. He has said that he bought that stock as a way to bet that Microsoft's acquisition of the video game maker will ultimately go through.
 
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate Buffett leads also trimmed its investments in the grocer Kroger and Ally Financial.
 
Buffett's biggest investment over the past year in oil producer Occidental Petroleum remained unchanged during the quarter. Berkshire held 194.4 million Occidental shares and warrants to buy another 83.9 million shares at the end of the year.

 United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Saturday said that technology companies like Apple and Google have expanded their phone production in India, and as the US looks forward to the future, she is eager to deepen ties in the technology sector.
United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was speaking at the roundtable with US and Indian Tech Business Leaders in Bengaluru on the sidelines of the first Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting under the India's G20 Presidency. ""I am eager to deepen out ties in the technology sector. The US is advancing an approach called ""friendshoring"" to bolster the resilience of our supply chains. We are doing this by strengthening integration with our many trusted trading partners-including India. We are seeing progress, as an example, technology companies like Apple and Google have expanded their phone production in India,"" Yellen said.
Janet said through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), the US is investing in digital technologies that will drive inclusive and resilient growth in India. Under PGII, the US has announced investment in agri-tech to enable climate-smart agricultural production, and in digital payments systems for micro-entrepreneurs, Yellen said, adding that these stand alongside investments, in renewable energy, health and other infrastructure sectors in India.
Overall, the secretary said the US aims to mobilise USD 200 billion through 2027 for PGII and the US looks forward to partnering with India to continue investing in future. The Roundtable was attended by top chief executives like Sandip Patel from IBM, Nandan Nilekani from Infosys, Nivruti Rai from Intel, Rishad Premji from Wipro, Josh Foulger from Foxconn, Vikram Rai from GE, Rekha Menon from Accenture, Alexander Slater from US India Business Council (USIBC) and Nivedita Mehra from US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).
Yellen's said that US is India's biggest trading partner. ""In 2021, our bilateral trade was over USD 150 billion. Our people-to-people ties affirm the closeness of our relationship. 2 lakh Indians are studying in America and enriching our schools and universities,"" she said, adding, ""We depend on each other on a daily basis. Indians use WhatsApp to communicate and many American companies rely on Infosys to operate.""
Yellen's last visit to India was in November for the US-India Economic and Financial Partnership. Nandan Nilekeni, Non-Executive Chairman, Infosys, said Infosys has 330,000 global workforce. Infosys has strong base in the US.
A world-class training centre in Indianapolis meant for only American people. Nilekeni said, ""We have recruited 7,000 fresh graduate this year. We work with all the US universities and have education institutes with 1,200 teachers in the US and we want to expand that.""
Nilekani said that Infosys runs India tax system at backend. ""Entire income tax and goods and services tax (GST) system is run by Infosys at the backend which is all digital and paperless,"" he added. He also said that US has invented internet and global positioning system (GPS). ""We realised that if we enable public infrastructure through the government at scale and make it open standard at the level playing field and being innovator at top, magic like Aadhar, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) happens,"" Nilekani added.
Sandip Patel, Managing Director, IBM India/South Asia said that it was great to meet and discuss the strengthening India-US trusted technology partnership. ""Proactive policy measures on critical and emerging tech will bolster friend-shoring and benefit economy and people of both nations,"" he added.",dtnext.in,61939,business,IN,en,ANI,https://gumlet.assettype.com/dtnext%2F2023-02%2Fd9f3d92a-eae6-45a3-8ee1-bb3e7c2e0a6c%2FAple.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&enlarge=true,False,ANI,6.8920197,a9a8a3b756fca994c82ee64e532a5d58

 美國貿易代表辦公室於2月21日表示，拜登政府（Biden Administration）不會否決美國國際貿易委員會（ITC）的Apple Watch進口禁令。ITC因判定蘋果（Apple）侵犯AliveCor的心臟監測相關專利而對其祭出禁令。
根據路透（Reuter）報導，AliveCor發言人表示，該公司已獲告知，拜登政府不會否決該禁令。

禁止Apple Watch進口美國？　拜登政府得於本周作出決定
ITC於2022年12月裁定，應禁止進口侵犯AliveCor專利的Apple Watch，但在相關專利訴訟進行期間，將暫停執行此禁令。美國專利商標局（USPTO）於12月稍早裁定這2項專利無效，AliveCor表示將提起上訴。
蘋果於2月21日表示，將對ITC的進口禁令決定提起上訴，因為該決定將對公眾健康產生負面影響。
白宮有60天時間決定是否基於政策考慮否決ITC的裁決。歷史上，美國總統很少否決ITC進口禁令。然而，歐巴馬政府在2013年蘋果和三星電子（Samsung Electronics）的專利之爭中撤銷對部分iPhone和iPad的禁令，理由是會對美國消費者和經濟競爭造成衝擊。
AliveCor指控蘋果侵犯與其KardiaBand相關的3項專利。KardiaBand是Apple Watch配件，可監控使用者心率，偵測心律不整情況，並透過心電圖辨識心房顫動等心臟問題。
AliveCor向ITC表示，蘋果抄襲其技術，並藉由讓KardiaBand與蘋果作業系統不相容，將其趕出市場。
Apple Watch Series 4、5、6、7和8都內建ECG技術。AliveCor已在加州聯邦法院控告蘋果壟斷Apple Watch心率App的美國市場，並在德州聯邦法院對蘋果提出相關專利侵權訴訟。蘋果則在舊金山聯邦法院反訴AliveCor侵犯其專利。

'When the Prime Minister launched the ‘Make in India' programme, people said many things about the scheme...but he was focused on this point only.

Talking about the major shift in the smartphone industry in the country, Vaishnaw said India used to import 99% smartphones from all over the world just 10 years ago, but thanks to the scheme, 99% of smartphones (in India) are now made in India.
 
 'This is a big achievement,' said the minister. This year,  according to Vaishnaw, India will export mobile phones worth $10 billion. 'Now there is the entire component ecosystem here, as volumes have increased. In the coming years, you will see exponential growth in electronics manufacturing and telecom manufacturing,' added the minister.
 
On the deployment of 5G in the country, the minister said India will cover 100% of the 5G network by the end of December 2024. So far, 5G services have been launched in 387 districts by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel across the country. Jio is deploying a 5G standalone (SA) network, whereas rival Airtel is deploying a 5G non-standalone (NSA) network.  'By the end of December 2024, we should achieve 100% coverage. 1 lakh base transceiver stations (BTSs) have been installed today.'

Who's next? Big Apple takes bite out of Irish market with CRH and Flutter moves,Joe Brennan,2023-03-03 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/03/03/whos-next-big-apple-takes-bite-out-of-irish-market-with-crh-and-flutter-moves/,irishtimes.com,Market Beat: The direction of travel set by the two heavyweights can hardly be seen as good news for Euronext Dublin,"The reaction among investors was unambiguous and swift when CRH, the largest company on the Iseq, 
revealed on Thursday
 it plans to move its primary stock listing to the US and accelerate its share buyback programme. Its stock jumped as much as 11.7 per cent during the day, adding €3.89 billion to its market value.
Few would have been happier than 4 per cent-shareholder, Swedish activist investor Cevian Capital, which first disclosed it had built up a stake in 2019 and has been pressing ever since for the company to reach its 'full potential'. (CRH's shares have almost doubled since Cevian made its presence on the shareholder register known.)
CRH has been laying the groundwork for a US listing for some time, having moved from reporting figures in euros to dollars three years ago, given the world's largest economy, where it is the biggest roadbuilder, had become its main source of profits. North America accounted for three-quarters of the group's $5.6 billion (€5.3 billion) of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) last year.
The hope is that CRH will benefit from how US stocks typically trade at a premium, relative to earnings, to their European peers.
Thursday's stock jump doesn't even begin to close the gap, Ian Hunter, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland, said in a note to clients on Friday, noting that with the company trading at an enterprise value of 7.9 times ebitda, it is still changing hands at a 26 per cent discount to peers, who are predominantly based in the US.
'We believe that given its current positioning in the market, growth prospects and balance sheet strength, it should at least trade at or close to parity,' he said.
CRH group chief executive Albert Manifold has also pitched to investors that a US listing would help the group to capitalise on massive US infrastructure funding and subsidies initiatives – under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act that have been signed into law by president Joe Biden in the past 16 months.
CRH isn't alone. Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, said in the middle of last month that it was looking at taking on a US stock market quotation. The expectation is that it will eventually move its main listing there – enabling it, like CRH, to chase the prize of being included in influential US stock indices.
The huge success of FanDuel, the fast-growing US fantasy sports website in which Flutter accumulated a 95 per cent stake since the country's supreme court moved in May 2018 to strike down a federal law banning the commercial sports betting, is gradually pulling Flutter's centre of gravity across the Atlantic. The US accounted for a third of total revenues last year of £7.7 billion (€8.6 billion).
Both CRH and Flutter, led by chief executive Peter Jackson, seem happy to shrug off the cautionary tale offered by Fyffes spin-off Total Produce. It ditched its Irish listing in mid-2021 in favour of the Big Apple as it merged with Dole Foods to create Dole plc, only to see its stock slump 40 per cent by the end of last year.
CRH, formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement and Roadstone companies, had already moved its primary listing to London in late 2011. The merger of Paddy Power with Betfair in early 2016 saw the combined entity also opt for the UK capital for its main listing (before the corporate name change to Flutter).
Both CRH and Flutter plan to keep their headquarters and tax residency in Ireland. And stockbrokers in Dublin are clinging to hopes that both companies will also keep their secondary listings here. Dublin, they argue, has become a more important hub for European investors to trade the stock since Brexit.
But the developments raise further questions about the future of the Euronext Dublin cash equities market.
A triple whammy over the past two decades of Irish pension funds being pressed to lower their exposure to Irish equities, foreign takeovers of the main local investment players, and a shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment, has conspired to make initial public offerings (IPOs) less attractive.
Only three companies – Uniphar, Corre Energy, and HealthBeacon – have floated in Dublin in the past four years. The further diminution of the Irish market by the moves by CRH and Flutter is hardly encouraging.
Keeping companies on the market has been even more difficult. Green Reit, Hibernia Reit, CPL Resources, Applegreen and Yew Grove have been acquired off the market in the past four years. Aryzta and Tullow Oil have scrapped their local listings.
Who else might have their eyes on the attractions of Wall Street? Glanbia, the purveyor of protein shakes and bars through the Optimum Nutrition and SlimFast brands, has to be top of the list, having said this week that it is changing the currency in which it reports its figures to dollars. Some 82 per cent of its revenues were generated in the US last year.

Glanbia's Optimum Nutrition becomes company's first billion dollar brand
 ]
Kerry Group, which had been plotting moving its main listing to New York when it was in talks in late 2019 to buy a US nutrition business, currently generates almost 40 per cent of its sales in that market.
It hasn't been missed that Albert Manifold and Peter Jackson have been the two best paid Iseq CEOs in recent times and each has seen his remuneration receive push-back from shareholder advisory firms in the past. This will be less of issue when the companies are trading on Wall Street.
It might be too late for Manifold, who received a record €13.9 million package for an Iseq company in 2021 and is on track to see his contact come to an end next year when he reaches 62. Not so for his successor.

 Tech giant Apple will reportedly launch a new iMac as early as the second half of this year, which is expected to come with a powerful M3 chip made with a 3nm process.
According to a report, the upcoming iMac will feature the same 24-inch display size as the previous model
Gurman said the new iMac will not likely go into mass production for at least three months, but it might still start shipping in the latter half of this year in the same colour choices as its predecessor, including blue, silver, pink, and orange.
Moreover, he said the new computer is at 'an advanced stage of development' and that the tech giant is currently 'conducting production tests of the machine.'
He further revealed that the production method for attaching the iMac's stand to the display is 'different,' and that some internal iMac components might be 'relocated and redesigned.'
The iPhone maker is expected to announce its new M3 chip at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June this year, where it might also unveil its highly-anticipated mixed-reality (MR) headset, the report said.",dtnext.in,61939,business,IN,en,Dt Next Bureau,https://gumlet.assettype.com/dtnext%2F2023-03%2F092ef5c3-774a-4c9c-a831-42cb8d095d7f%2FApple.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&enlarge=true,False,Dt Next Bureau,7.4486465,3be370f904c6bc946b9d2bb886342e98

 Samsung Electronics Executive Chairman Lee Jae-yong is visiting China to attend the China Development Forum where Apple CEO Tim Cook is also reportedly present, according to sources.
Lee arrived in Beijing to attend the high-profile annual forum, slated to run at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse from Saturday till Monday, reports Yonhap news agency.
The meeting will run under the theme of ""Economic Recovery: Opportunities and Cooperation"", focusing on ""opportunities in the Chinese market, stabilisation of global industrial chains, and green transition"", according to the organiser, the Development Research Center of China's State Council.
Apple CEO Tim Cook, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourlaother and Ola Kallenius, Mercedes-Benz Group AG's chairman, are reportedly among the attendees.
During his visit, Lee was expected to meet with global and Chinese CEOs and high-ranking Chinese government officials.
The forum will take place amid mounting tension between Washington and Beijing after the US government earlier this week released national security guardrails for its Chips Act, limiting business activities of chipmakers receiving federal subsidies to block China from getting access to key chip technologies.

 Apple is reportedly laying off a small percentage of people from one of its corporate teams amid the deepening global meltdown.
According to a report in Insider, Apple has told some corporate retail employees to reapply for their jobs or they will be laid off.
The reports said that Apple is slashing jobs in the division that ""handles building and upkeep for its retail stores"".
Affected employees have reportedly been told that they have until the end of the week to apply for other positions at the company.
""Apple is offering up to four months of severance pay for those that aren't able to stay,"" the reports mentioned.
Internally, the iPhone maker is ""pitching it as a way to improve its operations rather than as a cost-cutting measure"".
Apple is the only Big Tech company which has not done any massive layoffs so far amid the global economic downturn.
The company's CEO had told The Wall Street Journal that layoffs were ""a last resort.""
""We estimated that we would have grown on the iPhone absent the supply constraints. The macroeconomic situation is more difficult to estimate, but it's apparent from looking at the numbers that wind was in our face for the quarter,"" he was quoted as saying in the report.
Cook said the company is managing costs very tightly and is curtailing hiring in certain areas, while continuing to hire in others.
""I view layoffs as a last resort kind of thing,"" he added.

 After years of wait, Apple on Wednesday finally lifted the curtains off its much-awaited own branded retail store in India, as it ramps up plans to boost local manufacturing in a fillip to the Central government's 'Make in India' initiative.
Apple revealed the barricade of its first brick-and-mortar store in India at Jio World Drive Mall in Mumbai, officially marking the upcoming opening of Apple BKC.
New Inspired by the iconic 'Kaali Peeli' taxi art unique to Mumbai, the Apple BKC creative includes colourful interpretations of the decals combined with many Apple products and services that will be available for our customers to discover.
The creative for the store features a bright welcome to people passing by with the classic Apple greeting, ""Hello Mumbai"".
""To celebrate the opening of the new store, visitors can download the new Apple BKC wallpaper and move to the sounds of Mumbai with a specially curated playlist on Apple Music,"" said the company.
The company is all set to open the gates of the India retail store to the public this month.
Apple will also possibly launch a retail store in New Delhi at a later date.
The tech giant has set another all-time revenue record for the India market, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said recently that looking at the business in India, ""we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year and so we feel very good about how we performed"".
""That's despite the headwinds that we talked about. India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus. We broughtAthe online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple Retail there,"" Cook had announced in February.
He said that Apple actually did fairly well through Covid in India.
""That's the reason why we are investing there by bringing retail there, bringing the online store there and putting out a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India,"" the CEO added.

The announcement of a retail store in India assumes significance as the Cupertino-based tech giant is shifting its production base to India from China. Its assembling plants in China faced a complete shutdown in 2022 due to China's zero-Covid policy. Also, the tension between the US and the Chinese government is another reason that American technology companies are shifting their base to India or Vietnam.
 
According to Counterpoint Research, Apple may cross a 5% market share this year, from 1% in 2019. In February 2023, Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an earnings call, said India is a hugely exciting market for Apple and is a major focus.

In 2022, Apple started assembling the latest iPhone 14 models in India, weeks after its launch. In India, Apple's iPhones are manufactured by its contract manufacturers Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron.
 
According to market intelligence firm IDC, Apple has done very well across categories in the past couple of years, especially in iPhone sales. It sold around 6.7 million units in 2022, as against 4.8 million in 2021 and 2.7 million in 2020.
 
""While Apple has taken time to for its retail store foray in India, it makes sense now more than ever.

 Amid the local manufacturing push and an upcoming widespread retail store strategy, Apple shipped $7.5 billion worth iPhones and iPads in India in FY22-23, data accessed by IANS has shown.
In FY23, Apple shipped more than 7 million iPhones and half a million iPads in the country, registering a 28 per cent growth for iPhone shipments, according to initial estimates provided by market intelligence firm CMR.
As Apple doubles down on domestic manufacturing in India, the tech giant is likely to garner 6 per cent market share in FY23-34, with selling more than 8 million iPhones in the country in the period.
""In the FY22-23 period, Apple continued to accelerate its momentum in India, with double-digit growth in iPhone shipments year-on-year,"" Prabhu Ram, Head, Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.
Meanwhile, in the March quarter (the last quarter of FY23), iPhones registered 67 per cent growth, with 2.1 million shipments in the country.
""In the most recent March quarter, a strong uptick in consumer demand in India catalysed the shipments of iPads and iPhones. Specifically, the current iPhone 14 series, and the previous iPhone 13 line-up constituted for a majority of the shipments,"" Ram added.
iPhone 13 series garnered 48 per cent market share in Q1 2023, followed by iPhone 14 series at 44 per cent.
For the entire FY23, iPhone 14 series logged 36 per cent market share in India.
Looking ahead, Apple enjoys some favourable tailwinds in India, a strong future growth driver.
""There is growing 'premiumsation' in the Indian smartphone market, backed by a healthy urban demand for premium smartphones. Domestic iPhone manufacturing in India continues to see a healthy uptick, and there is potential for concurrent iPhone production with China on the horizon,"" Ram told IANS.
Apple will open its two flagship, own-branded retail stores, next week in Mumbai and New Delhi.

An apple official even asked to rotate the tree, being lifted with a crane so that the greener side with more leaves can face the retail store which is currently covered with colourful designs. The opening comes at a time when the California-based firm looks to grow its market share in India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world. As per CyberMedia Research (CMR), Apple has a 4 % market share in the Indian smartphone market.
 
The world's most valuable firm has placed its bet on India in manufacturing devices as its looks to shift its production away from China as relations between the US and China have soured over several issues. Apple assembled over USD 7 billion iPhones in India last fiscal year. The three-storied retail store is located at the posh Reliance Jio World Drive mall in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). 



NEW DELHI:  When it's about the opening of Apple's first retail store in the country, everything has to be perfect. Even if perfection means moving trees. Every fine detail counts, including whether the trees in front of the store are green enough or not.

After all, several high-profile guests are expected to attend the opening ceremony on Tuesday in Mumbai's commercial hub Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). While giving the finishing touches to the preparations for the opening ceremony, officials were seen asking the facility management personnel to replace the small trees near the store with bigger ones.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday said that the company is excited to build on its long-standing history in India, as it gears up to mark a major expansion with the opening of its first retail stores in the country.
Apple completes more than 25 years in India this week and the tech giant will open two own-branded retail stores -- at Jio World Drive Mall in Mumbai and at Select CityWalk mall in Saket, Delhi.
""India has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we're excited to build on our long-standing history -- supporting our customers, investing in local communities, and working together to build a better future with innovations that serve humanity,"" said Cook who will inaugurate the retail stores in the country, a first for the tech giant which has doubled down on its India growth plans.
Apple's first two retail stores in India will welcome customers from all over the country and around the world.
The new Apple flagship retail stores in Mumbai and Delhi, backed by aggressive sales initiatives, will fuel Apple's growth in the year ahead, according to industry experts.
India's vibrant community of app developers now supports more than 1 million jobs.
App Store payouts to developers in the country have more than tripled since 2018.
At the iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, Apple works one-on-one with developers to help take their apps from good to great.
Since 2017, the accelerator has hosted sessions for more than 15,000 developers, enabling them to build on their ideas and bring cutting-edge apps to the market.

We got a barrage of March-quarter earnings today and they provide a good summary of who's up and who's down in tech and media. (Spoiler alert: Apple did fine, but given how weak the smartphone and PC markets are, that's not saying much). For more details, grab a coffee (or a beer) and relax. Here we go:
In ride hailing, Lyft is barely growing and is still burning cash, which means it's doing much worse than its bigger rival, Uber, which 
reported on Tuesday
. Lyft stock dropped 15% after hours. In food delivery, DoorDash appears to be growing much faster than its main rival, Uber Eats. In entertainment, Paramount Global's quarter captured perfectly why investors hate TV companies. Growing losses on streaming collided with declining profits from TV, sending Paramount stock down 28%. In e-commerce, Shopify apparently realized its desire to build an Amazon-like logistics operation was nuts, as it decided to sell the business to Flexport in exchange for some of the startup's stock.

There were numerous complaints to the Director of the Apple Festival, Gina Kay Honosky, after the event was over last year and she immediately reached out to the owners in Raleigh. They were appalled and very apologetic and wanted her to express to the community that they were very sorry and would be taking measures to make sure that it would never happen again. The owner stated that he wanted to apologize to the community as this is not how they conduct business and steps were taken and employees were dealt with.

Why Apple's bid to control your car is striking fear into manufacturers,James Titcomb,2023-05-02 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/02/apples-bid-to-control-cars-strikes-fear-into-manufacturers/,telegraph.co.uk,Tech giant's reputation for hard bargaining pushes automakers to search for alternatives,"'That's why it is so dangerous for the [manufacturers] because it moves them along that road towards being basically mobile smartphones on wheels.'
Michael Dunne of ZoZo Go, an automotive advisory business, says this comes closer to the nightmare scenario that Dieter Zetsche, the former Mercedes boss, warned of in 2015 when he said the carmaker must not become the 'Foxconn of Apple', referring to the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones on Apple's behalf.
'[At that point], where's the brand? What's the value in the car? That's the risk, that they become irrelevant,' says Dunne.
'Why do people buy cars? Not that long ago, it was for performance and handling and braking, acceleration, and design. But increasingly, people are basing their decisions on the joy they derive from interacting with a car.'
Major manufacturers are now trying to go their own way. 
Tesla, 
which has invested heavily in its own system
 instead of embracing CarPlay, has served as an inspiration to manufacturers seeking to distance themselves from Apple.
Last month, General Motors said it would not offer the software in its upcoming electric vehicles, instead working with Google to include systems such as the search giant's maps in its built-in software. 
Mercedes has also unveiled plans to integrate Google into its cars.
Roger Lanctot, the director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics, says more are likely to follow GM.
'Car makers and their suppliers cannot stand Apple. While Google is challenging to do business with, Apple is unbearable and inflexible. Car makers simply can't stand doing business with the company and suppliers agree,' he says.
'Car makers are gambling that a Google-centric connected in-dash system will be far more compelling than anything Apple might be cooking up. No doubt Apple will tell car companies that they have no choice but to adopt the new CarPlay – that their customers will scream for it. The bottom line is that Apple will deliver a non-negotiable proposition – which automakers are increasingly inclined to walk away from.'
Dunne says that carmakers are hiring thousands of software developers in an attempt to match Apple and Google, but that 'it has never been their strong suit'.
The elephant in the room is the perennial threat that Apple will make its own car. 
Tim Cook has spent years toying with the idea and explored manufacturing opportunities with the likes of Nissan and Hyundai. 
So far, nothing has come of the idea. 
But Apple might not need to make a car to strike fear into manufacturers.",telegraph.co.uk,123,business,GB,en,"Ben Wright,Chris Price,Eir Nolsøe,Hannah Boland,James Titcomb,Kallum Pickering",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2023/05/02/TELEMMGLPICT000334164357_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNpPHkRvugymKLtqq96r_VP8.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,False,,7.257122,0b989afb46b8cdd69770326b4fbd1de1

 In a unique collaboration to safeguard the misuse of location-tracking devices, Apple and Google on Tuesday said they have jointly submitted an industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking.
The first-of-its-kind specification will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorised tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms.
Samsung, Tile, Chipolo, eufy Security, and Pebblebee have expressed support for the draft specification, which offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers.
""Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items,"" said Ron Huang, Apple's vice president of Sensing and Connectivity.
""This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections, and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android,"" Huang added.
The specification has been submitted via theAInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a leading standards development organisation for review and comment over the next three months.A
""Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industrywide action to solve,"" said Dave Burke, Google's vice president of Engineering for Android.
""Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users, and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices,"" he added.

 Apple's new high-yield savings account has drawn nearly $1 billion in deposits in just four days of its launch, the media reported, amid a cascade of US bank failures, the latest being First Republic Bank.
On launch day alone, the Apple savings account, which gives 4.15 per cent annual return, drew nearly $400 million deposits, reports Forbes.
'By the end of launch week, roughly 240,000 accounts had been opened,' the report said, citing sources.
The Apple savings account is offered through a partnership with Goldman Sachs.
Apple and Goldman Sachs, however, declined to comment on deposits and account numbers.

'Apple Card users can choose to grow their Daily Cash rewards with a Savings account from Goldman Sachs, which offers a high-yield APY of 4.15 per cent -- a rate that's more than 10 times the national average,' said the company.
With no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements, users can easily set up and manage their Savings account directly from Apple Card in Wallet.

 Smartphone shipments in the US declined 17 per cent (on-year) in the first quarter but Apple increased its market share to 53 per cent from 48 per cent in Q1 2022, a report has shown.
The market witnessed a dip in shipments across all major OEMs after registering a strong first quarter last year, according to Counterpoint Research.
""Persistent inflation and an uncertain economic outlook are causing consumers to hold off on new device purchases, resulting in lower upgrade rates and fewer device sales, especially in the prepaid segment,"" said research analyst Matthew Orf.
While prepaid brands saw significant YoY declines in shipments, there were some silver linings.
""Samsung's Galaxy S23 shipments were up double digits YoY while the Galaxy A14 5G performed exceptionally well in prepaid. The gap between low-end and premium devices seems to be widening, creating a vacuum in the mid-range device category,"" said senior analyst Maurice Klaehne.
Some niche categories may continue to perform well despite overall weakness.
""For instance, there is a lot of excitement around foldables this year as more OEMs jump onto the bandwagon, which may stir demand for premium devices,"" said associate research director Hanish Bhatia.
The uncertain economic outlook forced consumers to hold off on new device purchases in Q1.

 Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn), the world's biggest contract electronics manufacturer and assembler of iPhones, on Thursday reported a huge 56 per cent loss in net income (year-on-year) in the January-March period owing to sluggish consumer demand as few people are buying smartphones and other gadgets.
The net profit for the March quarter dropped to 12.8 billion Taiwanese dollars ($417.17 million) from 29.45 billion Taiwanese dollars in the first quarter last year.
Hon Hai Chairman and CEO Young Liu said in a statement that the outlook for full year 2023 overall remains flattish, ""with low visibility, particularly as monetary tightening around the world, coupled with geopolitical tensions, inflation and other uncertain factors impact the economic outlook"".
In the first quarter of 2023, revenue totaled 1.4624 trillion Taiwanese dollars, up 4 per cent year-on-year.
""With inventory adjustments following the growth bump from pandemic-driven demand for ICT goods and amid a traditionally off-peak season, the current quarter is expected to see declines both on an on-quarter and on-year basis,"" said Liu.
Among the company's primary product segments, cloud and networking products and computing products are likely to be flat quarter-on-quarter, while components and other products are likely to show quarterly growth.
In terms of partnering with traditional auto OEMs, Chairman Liu said auto brand manufacturers must face the challenges of time-to-market and time-to-cost.
This means a large part of the EV industry will actively move towards professional OEMs in the future, driving opportunities for Foxconn.
Foxconn is bullish on the India market as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ramps up its manufacturing and retail presence in the country.
The company has bought a huge tract of land on the outskirts of Bengaluru. According to reports, the company made the statement in this regard at London Stock Exchange.
According to the statement, the 1.2 million square metre (13 million square foot) plot has been acquired near Devanahalli located close to Bengaluru International Airport. According to sources, the land was bought for Rs 106.24 crore.

Apple's vision extends far beyond its cumbersome new headset,James Warrington,2023-06-06 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/06/06/apple-vision-pro-launch-tim-cook-virtual-reality/,telegraph.co.uk,Launch of Tim Cook's Vision Pro has prompted mixed reactions from investors,"The company is hoping that its track-record of launching paradigm shifting innovations and sleek, intuitive product design will tempt consumers to try its device where others have fallen flat.
Leo Gebbie, an analyst at CCS Insight, says: 'Apple's advantage over rivals is that the operating system on the new headset will be immediately familiar to existing users, and much of their favourite content, services and apps are all instantly available.
'It's a logical extension to everything Apple has built over the last decade.'
More concerning, however, is the eye-watering price tag. At $3,499, the Vision Pro will cost more than twice as much as the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the company's most expensive smartphone, and will be well out of reach for most people.
Inevitably, this means the headset is likely to achieve only modest sales, rather than mass-market appeal. Analysts at Wedbush estimate the company will sell just 150,000 units in the first year, rising to 1 million in the second year if prices come down.
UBS predicts that the Vision Pro could generate $6bn in revenue for the company in its first year of sales. That's less than half the $12.4bn in revenues it pulled in from the iPad in its first year.
'Don't expect Apple to sell millions of these – the manufacturing capacity isn't there, for a start,' says Joseph Teasdale, of Enders Analysis.
'Success will be the early adopters finding new and useful ways to fit the device into their daily lives, and developers building a software ecosystem for it. Failure will be a few hundred thousand Vision Pros languishing in drawers, or being dragged out at parties as a novelty.'
Shares in Apple surged to an all-time high ahead of Monday's launch show, giving the company a market valuation of $2.9 trillion. However, a higher-than-expected price and late release date (the device will only launch in 2024) left many investors reassessing their bets.

Tim Cook seeks Apple's next iPhone moment with bet on VR,James Titcomb,2023-06-04 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/06/04/apple-reality-pro-headset-vr-ar-next-iphone-moment-tim-cook/,telegraph.co.uk,Monday's launch is anticipated to be the most pivotal of Cook's leadership,"However, there is no doubt that the launch is the most pivotal of Cook's leadership. VR – and its sister technology augmented reality (AR), in which virtual objects are projected onto a person's view of the real world – represent a new computing paradigm: an alternative to the iPhone, rather than an augmentation of it.
'It feels like the riskiest product launch they've ever done,' says Ben Wood, a long-time Apple watcher at analysis firm CCS Insight. 'There are a lot of challenges to overcome to have a successful product and the expectations for Apple will be sky high, because everything they do, people expect it to be the best.'
VR is not a new technology. Nasa worked on prototype headsets as early as the 1970s. Nintendo released a 'Virtual Boy' headset in 1995 but halted sales after a year following damning reviews and complaints of nausea and headaches.
Mark Zuckerberg paid $3bn for VR company Oculus nine years ago, and in subsequent years HTC, Meta and Sony 
released headsets that connected to powerful gaming computers or consoles.
Wood says: 'So far, there's very little evidence that virtual and augmented reality is something that is on a very strong growth trajectory.'
An apparent breakthrough moment came in 2019 when Facebook released the Quest, the first headset that could play powerful games without having to plug into a computer. Its successor, the Quest 2, 
was seen by Mark Zuckerberg as the 'first mainstream VR headset'.
In 2021, sales of VR headsets almost doubled to 11.2m units. The Quest 2 accounted for four in five of those. Zuckerberg was captured enough to rename his company Meta and declare that the virtual reality universe was the future of the internet.
A year later, 
that vision is hanging by a thread.
 Sales of VR headsets fell by 21pc in 2022, according to IDC, and by a huge 54.4pc in the first quarter of this year.",telegraph.co.uk,123,business,GB,en,"Adam Mawardi,Howard Mustoe,James Titcomb,Jeremy Warner,Roger Bootle,Szu Ping Chan",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2023/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000271295970_16858900361100_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq66FSlHuMRN3pmtpFY4E1gkytRZ0Bji-YvVbFFz8TQZ0.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,False,,6.9802585,daa68bb68cac82eb737cfeddb5b0cbee

Index gains have been largely driven by the 'surging seven' – Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet. 
Stocktake has covered this theme repeatedly of late, but breadth finally appears to be improving. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which weighs each component stock equally, has been strong lately, suggesting more stocks are participating in the rally. 
The percentage of stocks above their 50-day (62 per cent) and 200-day average (60 per cent) is rising. Hi Mount Research's Willie Delwiche, who has been concerned by weak breadth this year, is encouraged by the fact the number of stocks hitting new highs is now exceeding the number of new lows. Markets have been more 'balanced' in June, says Bespoke Investment. 
At the end of May, just three of the S&P 500′s 11 sectors had outperformed the index. However, every sector is up in June, with the number of outperformers 'much more evenly split'.

10 New Features iOS 16.6 Is Bringing to Your iPhone in Apple's Next Software Update,Justin Meyers,2023-06-28 00:00:34,date,https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/10-new-features-ios-16-6-is-bringing-your-iphone-apples-next-software-update-0385374/,gadgethacks.com,"Apple already released the iOS 17 beta to developers, but that doesn't mean the company's done updating iOS 16.

the iOS 17 beta
 to developers, but that doesn't mean the company's done updating iOS 16. There's already a new 
iOS 16.6
 software update in the works, and it might come with an important feature for your iPhone that's been highly anticipated since it was announced last year.




The highly anticipated feature, Contact Key Verification for iMessage, was 
announced
 by Apple on Dec. 7, 2022, alongside 
Security Keys for Apple ID
 and 
Advanced Data Protection for iCloud
, and iOS 16.6's beta code holds the first clues to Contact Key Verification's future arrival. In fact, these Contact Key Verification hints are the only noticeable additions on iOS 16.6 so far.
On 
iOS 16.6 beta 1
, if you search the Settings app for the feature, it'll show up in the results. However, tapping it opens the Apple ID settings without a Contact Key Verification option visible. Apple also 
baked a URL scheme for Contact Key Verification
 (seen below) into the first beta. As with the search result, it also just takes you to the Apple ID settings since the submenu doesn't exist yet.
 
prefs:root=APPLE_ACCOUNT&path=TRANSPARENCY
 
These clues to Contact Key Verification's materialization were removed by Apple on 
iOS 16.6 beta 2
. A search in Settings no longer shows it, and the bundle that listed the URL scheme was removed from the preference manifests.
Contact Key Verification is similar to 
Signal's safety number system
 in that it's meant to assure you that you're talking with who you think you're talking with. Like Signal's safety number, which provides a 
shareable numerical fingerprint
 that identifies you as you, iMessage Contact Key Verification assigns a Contact Verification Code to each contact that can be compared in person, over FaceTime or another video call service, via a secure call, and so on.
 
 
When you verify a contact's Contact Verification Code, you'll know you're iMessaging them and not an eavesdropper, protecting you from man-in-the-middle attacks. But that's not the only thing iMessage Contact Key Verification can do.
According to Apple, iMessage Contact Key Verification, like 
iOS 16's Lockdown Mode
, is built for users ""who face extraordinary digital threats,"" such as politicians, journalists, military personnel, investors, human rights defenders, dissidents, lawyers, activists, government workers, and other potential targets of state-sponsored cyberattacks.
For extra protection, ""conversations between users who have enabled iMessage Contact Key Verification receive automatic alerts if an exceptionally advanced adversary, such as a state-sponsored attacker, were ever to succeed breaching cloud servers and inserting their own device to eavesdrop on these encrypted communications.""

If you use iCloud for Windows, you may notice a slight change when logging in. Whenever your iPhone and Windows computer aren't on the same Wi-Fi network, your iPhone will show a new prompt when trying to sign in to iCloud for Windows with a verification code.
Switch to Different Wi-Fi Network
To sign in to iCloud for Windows with a verification code, your iPhone and Windows computer need to be on the same network.

Apple Pay Later, Apple's new post-purchase payment, lets you split purchases between $50 and $1,000 that you then pay back over six weeks in four equal installments without any interest or fees. It's similar to other buy-now-pay-later services such as Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna but accepted by most websites and apps that already accept Apple Pay.
On March 28, 2023, Apple 
started
 inviting select users at random to try out Apple Pay Later on iOS 16.4 and later, but it still hasn't gone live yet. Apple Pay Later is supposed to be an iOS 16 feature (it was announced at Apple's WWDC last June), and Apple did say in March's press release that it plans to offer the feature to all eligible users in the coming months. It's now three months after invites started rolling out, and Apple Pay Later is still not ready — but iOS 16.6 may finally unleash the payment feature to everyone.
 
 
It still appears as an early-access feature on iOS 16.6 and may still be for randomly selected accounts, but that may change once the stable release is pushed out to everyone in the coming weeks.
 
 




Apple added images of the 
black and gold
 Beats Studio Buds + 
on iOS 16.4
, and iOS 16.6 beta 2 brings us pictures of the other two colors: 
ivory
 and 
transparent
. So if you have those models, you'll now see the correct icons viewable on your iPhone. Beats Studio Buds + were released earlier this month.
 
 




In the 
News
 app on iOS 16.6, whenever you long-press or tap the ellipsis (•••) for a sports score or scheduled game, you'll see a new option to ""Share Game."" Previously, you would have to go to the game, tap the ellipsis up top, and choose ""Share Game"" from there, so the process is quicker now.
You may also notice below that iOS 16.5 previews the game page while iOS 16.6 doesn't. That is not a change; it's like that on older iOS 16 versions, but the view may depend on your iPhone model and layout settings.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled and a recovery key set up on your Apple ID account and can't remember you're login password, you need to enter the 28-character recovery key that was assigned when you first turned the feature on to get you back into the account.
When you're locked out on your iPhone, you'll see three new prompts when trying to enter your recovery key:
Enter Recovery Key Later
 
Don't Have Recovery Key?
 
Try Again Later




When adding people to your home in the Home app, you may get a prompt asking you to upgrade your home to the latest version, which has a new underlying architecture as of iOS 16.4. Upgrading is optional for now.
Update recommended
Home has a new underlying architecture that will improve the performance of your home. Upgrade this home and ask members of the home to upgrade to the latest version.
[Upgrade Home] | [Add People Without Upgrading]




When trying to pair new Matter accessories, iOS 16.6 may issue a warning prompt if the app you're using is trying to pair the accessory in an unsecured way. You can manage unauthorized access in Settings –> General –> VPN & Device Management, which implies this warning will only come up for apps installed via mobile device management (MDM).

Besides the above 10 things, there's little going on with iOS 16.6. I've seen a few minor tweaks that aren't worth mentioning and a couple of new items whose purpose is unknown, so you can expect mostly bug fixes and security patches when iOS 16.6 hits in June or July.

Apple forced to make major cuts to Vision Pro headset production plans,,2023-07-03 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/07/03/apple-forced-to-make-major-cuts-to-vision-pro-headset-production-plans/,irishtimes.com,Initial hopes of 1 million shipments in 2024 launch year dashed by manufacturing problems,"Apple has been forced to make drastic cuts to production forecasts for the mixed-reality Vision Pro headset, unveiled last month after seven years in development and hailed as its most significant product launch since the iPhone.
The complexity of the headset design and difficulties in production are behind the scaling back of targets, while plans for a more affordable version of the device have had to be pushed back, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the manufacturing process.
Apple has already flagged that the $3,500 (€3,214) 'spatial computing' headset device will not go on sale until 'early next year', a lengthy gap from its June 5 launch. Analysts have interpreted this as being more to do with supply chain problems than allowing developers time to create apps for the Vision Pro.
Two people close to Apple and Luxshare, the Chinese contract manufacturer that will initially assemble the device, said it was preparing to make fewer than 400,000 units in 2024. Multiple industry sources said Luxshare was currently Apple's only assembler of the device. Separately, two China-based sole suppliers of certain components for the Vision Pro said Apple was only asking them for enough for 130,000 to 150,000 units in the first year.
Both projections imply a significant cut to production from an earlier, internal sales target of 1 million units in the first 12 months. The forecasts for low volumes reflect Apple's lack of confidence in being able to scale production, according to analysts and industry experts, following years of missed deadlines in launching the device.
Apple, whose market valuation closed above $3 trillion on Friday, three weeks after the announcement of the headset, declined to comment on the Vision Pro.
Luxshare did not respond to a request for comment.
Among the major hurdles being faced is the manufacturing of the sleek screens for the device. They consist of two micro-OLED displays – one per eye – and an outward-facing, curved 'lenticular' lens. The inward displays offer a resolution exceeding anything currently on the market, while the outward lens projects the headset wearer's eyes to the outside world.
The micro-OLED displays for the prototypes in the June demonstration were supplied by Sony and the chipmaker TSMC, according to two people familiar with the situation. Sony and TSMC declined to comment on any role in the Vision Pro.
Apple has been unhappy with suppliers' productivity, said those people, especially with the yield of micro-OLEDs that are free of defects. The displays are the most expensive component in the Vision Pro.
'A lot of this is normal growing pains,' said Jay Goldberg, founder of tech consultancy D/D Advisors. 'This is the most complex consumer device anyone has ever made.'
Goldberg said the higher than expected $3,500 price point already implied that Apple had baked in the cost of production inefficiencies, knowing that manufacturing yields were especially low compared with the mature products in Apple's portfolio.
'Someone has to pay for that,' he added. 'I think Apple went into this with a lot of ‘bad yield' built into the model. There is a lot of technology in the Vision Pro and they knew it would take a while to scale up. Apple knows they won't make money on this in the first year.'
Sony was cautious about how much the mixed-reality headset market would expand and was reluctant to step up production significantly, said Terushi Shimizu, head of Sony's semiconductor unit, in a recent media round-table.
'We will be watching to see how much demand [for micro-OLED displays] will increase,' he said. 'But I don't think we will be aggressive [in producing] in the same scale as image sensors', for which Sony is building a new plant to boost production for the chips used in smartphone cameras.
Meanwhile, Apple is already working on later generations of the headset, including a more affordable version that is expected to appeal more to mass-market consumers, said two people with direct knowledge.
Apple is working with Korean display makers Samsung and LG on this second-generation headset. In order to drive the price lower, the iPhone maker has explored using other display technologies, including mini-LED, but two people said Apple was insisting on using micro-OLED even for the non-Pro headset, even though all suppliers had so far failed to match its expectations.
The cut to 2024 forecasts has disappointed Luxshare, which has been gearing up its capacity to be able to build nearly 18 million units annually in the coming years, according to one person close to the assembler.
Analysts said the whole headset supply chain in Asia was not getting much of a boost from the Vision Pro. 'Apple has not made a better product than the industry imagined ... the manufacturers' confidence is not high,' said Eddie Han, an analyst at Taiwan-based Isaiah Research.
Despite the setbacks, market intelligence group Canalys believed Apple would surpass a user base of 20 million within five years of launch.
'Given the limited production numbers, it will be flying off the shelves, pre-ordered by Apple's loyal fans and high net worth users in the US,' said Canalys analyst Jason Low. His projection was currently for Apple to produce 350,000 units next year, increasing to 12.6 million units five years later. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/KkP6AkpOTD25w03k6mRoW2iWteQ=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/AOKQ6DMUU4SFUEYTMNFNGZLV4M.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,7.0372334,46a47893bb3ae0074ecb395a8ed239b5

Although Apple's market cap managed to break the US$3 trillion barrier back in January 2022, it never managed to close a trading day at that value until last Friday. The event took place after the shares of the tech giant headquartered in Cupertino climbed 2.31%, reaching a new high of US$193.97.

Business






Last Friday, the trading day opened for Apple with a price of US$191.63 per share, reaching an intraday high of US$194.48 and also dropping to a low point of US$191.26. However, the closing price of US$193.97 was enough to help Apple's value hit the highest figure ever recorded at the end of a trading day and to become the first publicly traded company to close with a market value of more than US$3 trillion. Only four other US-based publicly traded companies are currently 
valued at more than US$1 trillion
. These companies are Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google).


Apple's market cap reached briefly the US$3 trillion milestone back in early 2022. Sadly, it never closed a trading day with a value above this threshold. In the time that passed ever since, the tech giant headquartered in Cupertino unveiled its plans to enter new markets with great potential (for example augmented reality thanks to the recently unveiled 
Apple Vision Pro
 which should be available next year) and also had to face an increasing demand for both hardware products and various services. A move like the introduction of USB-C charging for more products, including smartphones, could also have a solid positive impact on the company's medium and long-term stock market performance.


Thanks to the ingredients mentioned above, the company's stock price has managed to grow by more than 50% this year, which started at US$125.07, which is the closing price recorded on January 3 (the first trading day of the year).

"Business tycoon Carlos Ghosn's rise, fall and dramatic escape is subject of new Apple TV+ series",Associated Press,2023-08-23 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/08/23/business-tycoon-carlos-ghosns-rise-fall-and-dramatic-escape-is-subject-of-new-apple-tv-series,ny1.com,"Carlos Ghosn, the former rock star businessman who fell from grace and fled authorities smuggled in a music instrument box, is getting what his dramatic story deserves — a multi-part Apple TV+…","NEW YORK (AP) — 
Carlos Ghosn,
 the former rock star businessman who fell from grace and fled authorities smuggled in a music instrument box, is getting what his dramatic story deserves — a multi-part documentary series.
 
'Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn'
 is the juicy real tale of how the auto executive went from attending red carpets as the head of both Nissan and Renault to fleeing to Lebanon with the help of a former Green Beret.
 
'The Carlos Ghosn story is unbelievable in the sense that it's a Shakespearean tragedy in which we have an archetypal tragic hero who everybody wants to root for but knows the train crash is coming,' said Sean McLain, a consulting producer on the Apple TV+ series and Wall Street Journal reporter.
 
The four-part series, which starts Friday, takes a wider lens to Ghosn's story, tracing the childhood and rise of the auto executive which Time magazine once put ahead of Bill Gates among the 15 most influential global business executives.
 
Voices included are Louis Schweitzer, former CEO of Renault; Andy Palmer, former COO of Nissan; Arnaud Montebourg, former French minister of economy; Takashi Yamashita, former Japanese minister of justice; and Hiroto Saikawa, former Nissan CEO.
 
Most crucially, director James Jones went to Lebanon and sat down with Ghosn and his wife, Carole, on camera. Jones got the job before he'd secured access to the couple but knew he had to have them participate.
 
'You need to hear from the people in the room. You can't just have pundits commentating on what happened or kind of rehashing the story second-hand,' Jones says. 'For me, getting Carlos and Carole Ghosn to talk frankly was a huge thing and I think that the series would have been a struggle to make without that.'
 
Many viewers may tune in because of the brazen way Ghosn left Japan in 2019 after being accused of financial improprieties. He turned to Mike Taylor, a former Green Beret, who hid the executive in a large music instrument box — with breathing holes drilled in — and got him out on a private jet.
 
'My initial reaction was like, ‘Is there enough for four parts?' I know he's an interesting guy who is a brilliant businessman, and the escape is thrilling,"" said Jones. 'But then when I spent the time reading up about it, it did feel rich and the kind of thing that's quite satisfying to really get your teeth into.'
 
The Brazilian-born Ghosn took refuge in Lebanon, his ancestral homeland, which has no extradition treaty with Japan. He denied the financial improprieties charges and said Japan's justice system was unfair. 'I did not escape justice. I fled injustice,' he said at the time.
 
The series also investigates Japan's legal system, which critics say amounts to 'hostage justice,' allowing suspects to be questioned for days without a lawyer present while they are kept in solitary confinement in a small, spartan cell. The conviction rate of over 99% has raised questions over forced confessions.
 
The case against Ghosn centers on elaborate calculations to compensate him after retirement for a pay cut he took beginning in 2009, when disclosure of big executive pay became a legal requirement in Japan.
 
Ghosn argues the case against him was concocted in a power struggle within Nissan's boardroom and the series does show a conspiracy by Nissan officials to get rid of Ghosn because they feared a merger with Renault.
 
'He was wronged and yet these allegations look very bad,' said Jones. 'And by hiding out in Lebanon, he's not helping the appearance of innocence.'
 
Ghosn may have escaped but not everyone who helped him did the same. Taylor was sentenced to two years in prison, while his son, Peter, was sentenced to one year and eight months for his part. They claim in the series that Ghosn never paid them for their work helping him escape.
 
Jones sees the Ghosn saga as a cautionary tale of a leader who lost his bearings. The executive may have believed that because he'd saved Nissan and Renault that he deserved extra compensation.
 
'He thought he had saved these companies from extinction and made them successful and made them in his own image and therefore was kind of entitled to play by his own rules to some extent,' he said.
 
McLain, whose book with fellow Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Kostov 'Boundless' informed the series, said Ghosn's fall illustrates the need for checks and balances in the C-suite.
 
'He was going to retire a very wealthy man, but because he wanted more, what he's going to be known for from now on is spiriting himself away from Japan by hiding in a box.'

Brussels is working through a dense legislative agenda to build tougher regulation of big tech, arguing it needs to protect European consumers online and to encourage competition in an industry dominated by US giants.
 
The latest announcement is a milestone in the application of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which will force the largest firms to change their ways under a checklist of dos and don'ts and, regulators hope, create a fairer market.
 
Observers say the law could open a new battlefront between digital titans and the European Union as some companies consider launching legal challenges.
 
The European Commission, the EU's powerful antitrust body, named 22 ""core platform"" services belonging to five US tech behemoths identified as ""gatekeepers"" -- Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft -- and China's ByteDance.
 
The services included Apple's App Store; Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; Google's YouTube video platform and Chrome browser, as well as Apple's Safari.
 
Others included operating systems run by Apple, Microsoft and Google as well as Alphabet's Google Maps, Play and Shopping.
 
They must fully comply with the DMA by March 6, 2024.
 
The ""gatekeeper"" status applies when a service has more than 45 million monthly active users and more than 10,000 yearly active business users established in the EU.
 
Apple on Wednesday said it was ""very concerned about the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users"" and said it would seek to ""mitigate these impacts"".
 
There will be fines of up to 10 percent of a firm's global revenues for breaking some of the most serious competition rules, and even up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
 
One major change under the DMA is the rule that forces interoperability between messaging apps, making it easier for users to share links and images.
 
""With today's designation we are finally reining in the economic power of six gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies,"" said the EU's top tech enforcer, industry commissioner Thierry Breton.
 
  Taking a bite of the Apple 
 
Apple and Microsoft argued parts of their businesses should not be classified as a ""core"" service, and the commission said it launched probes to assess Apple's claims regarding iMessage, and Microsoft for Bing, Edge and its advertising platform.
 
A Microsoft spokesperson welcomed the decision to launch an investigation into the three services which the company said ""operate as challengers in the market"".
 
Meanwhile, Apple said it looked ""forward to explaining to the commission why iMessage is outside the scope of the DMA"".
 
The EU has led the way globally for taking on big tech.
 
The DMA, alongside its sister law, the Digital Services Act (DSA), gives the commission sharper teeth against tech behemoths that critics say have for too long been given free rein to act to the detriment of users.
 
One of the DMA's main aims is to stop larger players crushing the progression of smaller companies that threaten to become rivals by gobbling them up through takeovers.
 
The EU believes past examples of this are Facebook's buyouts of Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Google's purchase of YouTube and Waze.
 
The commission must be notified of all takeovers, regardless of size, under the DMA.
 
One of the law's main targets is Apple, previously the subject of multiple investigations and slapped with huge EU fines.
 
The new rules will force the iPhone-maker to allow alternative app stores on its products, allowing software and payments to be made outside of its control.
 
The commission is also looking into whether Apple's iPadOS system should be designated as a ""gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds"", it said.
 
Under the DMA, companies are forbidden to favour their own services over those offered by competitor firms and will have to share key information with business customers.

Apple to update iPhone 12 in France after radiation concerns,James Titcomb,2023-09-15 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/15/iphone-12-radiation-france-apple-software-update/,telegraph.co.uk,UK regulators are monitoring the situation after the model failed EU limits,"Apple
 will issue a software update to iPhone 12 users in France in response to 
fears about high radiation levels
.
Sales of the smartphone were due to be suspended later this month after a French regulator found the device emitted radiation that exceeded European Union-approved limits.
Apple had downplayed safety concerns and blamed the unique testing regime used by ANFR, France's radiation watchdog.
The tech giant is only applying the iPhone 12 update in France, although other regulators, including in Britain, are monitoring the situation.
Details about what the software update will do have not yet been announced, although it is likely to alter slightly the wireless signals emitted by the phone's radios.
'We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators,' Apple said.
'This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern.
'Since it was introduced in 2020, iPhone 12 has been certified and recognised as meeting or exceeding all applicable SAR [radiation] regulations and standards around the world.'
Apple is in the process of phasing out sales of the three-year-old iPhone 12 after it unveiled its latest model, the
 iPhone 15
, earlier this week.
France's telecommunications minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: 'Since the decision to withdraw the iPhone 12 from the French market, I have spoken several times with the Apple teams.
'ANFR is preparing to quickly test this update which would ultimately make the model compliant with European standards applied in France and lift the withdrawal from marketing.'
Britain's Office for Product Safety has been monitoring the situation in France, while regulators in Belgium and Germany are also watching developments.

NEW DELHI: American tech giant Apple on Tuesday launched the iPhone 15 series with a brighter display and a 48-megapixel camera as well as 100% recycled cobalt in their batteries. In India, the phone will be available from September 22 and pre-order will start at 5:30 pm on September 15.

The starting price for iPhone 15 in India is Rs 79,900, the iPhone pro Rs 1,34,900 and the iphone Pro Max is Rs 1,59,900.

iPhone 15 Pro with a titanium case and faster chip enables better graphics and mobile gaming. According to the company, the iPhone 15's satellite connectivity can now be used to summon roadside assistance.

While unveiling the new phones, Apple CEO Tim Cook posted on X: 'Meet iPhone 15 Pro & Pro Max!

USB-C charging cables are coming to both its iPhone 15 and the charging case of its AirPods Pro devices, which will allow the use of the same charging cables used for iPads and Macs. Last year, Apple began production of iPhone 14 smartphones in India weeks after the launch. Currently, Apple produces 7% of its iPhones in India, and it is planning to increase it to 25% by 2025.

Apple, through its contract manufacturers like Foxconn, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp. (soon to be acquired by Tata Group), started production of iPhones with iPhone SE in 2017. Since then, it has continued to expand its operations in India, leading up to the launch of the iPhone 15.

Fresh blow for the City of London as British Apple supplier snubs LSE,Matthew Field,2023-09-16 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/16/imagination-apple-supplier-nyse-listing-fresh-blow-for-city/,telegraph.co.uk,"Imagination Technologies, a rival to Arm, has filed confidential paperwork to go public in New York","The London Stock Exchange has suffered a new blow after the British microchip company Imagination Technologies snubbed the City in favour of a Wall Street IPO.
Imagination has confidentially registered to go public in New York, six years after it was taken off the London Stock Exchange and sold to a Chinese-backed fund, the Telegraph can reveal.
Preparations to go public come after the microchip giant Arm 
pulled off a $54bn (£43bn) float last week
, after opting for New York's Nasdaq exchange over London.
Imagination is likely to be valued well above the £550m it was bought for in 2017 and could pursue a flotation as early as this year, although 2024 is seen as more likely. It is working with banks including Barclays on the deal.
The company had been weighing up London and New York as it worked with advisers on a flotation in 2021, before a slump in technology valuations and a barren IPO market led it to suspend plans.
Its decision to revive the plans and float in New York is the latest setback for the London Stock Exchange, following Cambridge-headquartered Arm's similar move and a string of companies 
ditching the UK for US listings
.
Plumbing supplier Ferguson and building materials company CRH have both moved to New York, while bookmaker Flutter is preparing a secondary listing in the US. British pollster YouGov has said it would considering moving its shares to the US or adding a secondary listing.
The number of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange has fallen by 60pc since the late 1990s and daily trade on the market has also fallen sharply.
The decline has sparked alarm in Downing Street, with the Treasury seeking ways to revive activity and encourage listings. Jeremy Hunt set out measures to cut red tape when raising money on the market in his Mansion House speech earlier this year.
London has faced particular difficulty in attracting tech companies to list in recent years.

The National Frequency Agency, which oversees radio-electric frequencies as well as public exposure to electromagnetic radiation, called on Apple in a statement Tuesday to 'implement all available means to rapidly fix this malfunction' for phones already being used.
 
Corrective updates to the iPhone 12 will be monitored by the agency, and if they don't work, 'Apple will have to recall' phones that have already been sold, according to the French regulator's statement.
 
Apple disputed the findings and said the device complies with all regulations governing radiation.
 
The agency, which is known by the French acronym ANFR, said it recently checked 141 cellphones, including the iPhone 12, for electromagnetic waves capable of being absorbed by the body.
 
It said it found a level of electromagnetic energy absorption of 5.74 watts per kilogram during tests of a phone in a hand or a pocket, higher than the European Union standard of 4 watts per kilogram.
 
The agency said the iPhone 12 met the threshold when radiation levels were assessed for a phone kept in a jacket or in a bag.
 
Apple said the iPhone 12, which was released in late 2020, has been certified by multiple international bodies and complies with all applicable regulations and standards for radiation around the world.
 
The U.S. tech company said it has provided the French agency with multiple lab results carried out both by the company and third-party labs proving the phone's compliance.
 
Cellphones have been labeled as 'possible' carcinogens by the World Health Organization's cancer research arm, putting them in the same category as coffee, diesel fumes and the pesticide DDT. The radiation produced by cellphones cannot directly damage DNA and is different from stronger types of radiation like X-rays or ultraviolet light.

Design:


Basically, Apple has not opted for a really new design language for the iPhone 15 Pro. So, at first glance, the 2023 and 2022 models look very similar. However, if we look a bit closer, we actually notice some exciting changes. For example, the USB Type-C port is new and replaces the Lightning port. Another new feature is the new action button, which replaces the mute button but can be assigned with all sorts of functions.







 and Pro Max look even better than their predecessors. / © Apple





Also new: The iPhone 15 Pro (Max) is less angular, as Apple again relies more on rounded edges. The dimensions have changed minimally, but the weight loss of the newcomers is more noticeable: the 15 Pro series each loses 19 g compared to the 14 devices - the difference should be clearly felt.







iPhone 14 Pro in review


iPhone 14 Pro Max in the test




Among other things, we have the choice of materials to thank for this. Instead of stainless steel, we find a titanium frame in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. This makes the devices both lighter and more robust. This does not change the protection against water and dust; the IP68 certification remains unchanged.


Finally, Apple has opted for new colors: Instead of dark purple, gold, silver, and space black, the tech giant from Cupertino now wraps its top models in titanium natural, titanium blue, titanium white, and titanium black.







Welcome to Cupertino, my dear USB Type-C connector. / © Apple





Display:


We already mentioned the rounded edges of the display, but that was really it for changes. So yes: You will still get 6.1-inch or 6.7-inch ""Super Retina XDR"" displays with identical resolution. In addition, there is still the always-on display, peak brightness of 2,000 nits, and the ProMotion technology, thanks to which the refresh rate fluctuates between 1 and 120 Hz.





This category should be one of the most exciting in the upcoming tests. The last A16 Bionic SoC is now replaced by the new A17 Pro. As long as we are still waiting for our test devices, we will have to rely on what Apple has revealed to us in advance. But if even 
Antoine is considering switching back to the iPhone camp
, we are probably in for a real performance monster.
 
(Almost) nothing has changed in terms of architecture: The 6-core CPU is once again made up of two performance cores and four efficiency cores. Instead of five cores, the GPU now has six cores, and the Neural Engine remains at 16 cores. The neural engine is supposed to be twice as fast as in the A16 Bionic, the ray tracing even four times faster. The CPU itself is supposed to work ten percent faster than in the last processor generation, the GPU even up to 20 percent faster.







According to Apple, the iPhone 15 Pro will be a pure gaming ""monster"". / © Apple





Sounds powerful, but we have to verify it in tests first. As soon as that is done, we will expand this section with a meaningful table with benchmark test results. Otherwise, there is not much wild news in terms of hardware and connectivity that has changed since the iPhone 14 Pro. The storage options remain the same, apart from the fact that there is no longer a 128 GB alternative for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Only the Wi-Fi has been updated from WiFi 6 to 6E, which is worth mentioning.
 
iPhone 14 Pro (Max) vs. iPhone 15 Pro (Max): Camera


While the change to the 48 MP main camera is a breath of fresh air in the camera section of the base models, surprisingly little is happening in the Pro. On paper, the 48 MP main camera remains, as well as a 12 MP ultra-wide-angle cam and a 12 MP telesensor. However, the main camera's sensor is supposed to be larger and thus extract even more from the photos and reduce noise, especially in adverse lighting conditions.







For the first time in many generations, Apple changed the resolution of the main camera in 2022. The 48 MP sensor is still current in 2023. / © nextpit





With the telephoto lens, instead of the triple optical zoom, even fivefold magnifications are now possible thanks to a new periscope technology - but only on the Pro Max, not on the Pro. The selfie camera also remains unchanged. Of course, Apple also claims to have improved the software so that faces in particular, but also dogs and cats, are automatically recognized and directly photographed in portrait mode. All in all, it sounds like the camera has not developed outstandingly in the new Pro series. But don't worry: Our test will shed light on this as well.





As expected, we can again be brief here. Of course, the iPhones of the 15 series are launched with 
iOS 17
. But this software version also finds its way onto the iPhone 14 Pro, so there are no major differences. The exception here is, of course, the updates for the new iPhones, which are available for a year longer. Basically, new features like 
NameDrop
, 
ContactPoster
, or the Live Sticker are available for all iPhones that also get iOS 17.

For the iPhone 14, Apple communicated the following key data on charging speed:


iPhone 14 Pro:




Video playback: 23 hours


Video (streaming): 20 hours


Audio playback: 75 hours




iPhone 14 Pro Max:




Video playback: 29 hours


Video (streaming): 25 hours


Audio playback: 95 hours




In addition, we know that wired charging is officially up to 20 W (unofficially up to 27 W). Up to 15 W is possible via MagSafe and up to 7.5 W wirelessly.


All that I mentioned here for the iPhone 14 Pro (Max) is also valid for the iPhone 15 Pro (Max). So, it does not confirm that the new Pro model can be charged faster (with up to 35 W). Even though the battery capacity has been increased slightly, the devices should last as long as before.


Of course, you will benefit from the USB Type-C port and thus have more flexibility when buying the chargers.





US prices remained largely the same for the iPhone 15 generation, with one important exception. With the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the base price is now $100 higher. However, we already mentioned that the flagship model for 2023 no longer offers a 128 GB option.


What does that mean in concrete terms? That you had to pay $999 for the 128 GB version of the iPhone 14 Pro last year, and the same for the iPhone 15 Pro. For the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the entry-level price of $1199 gets the 256 GB version instead of the 128 GB version, which is no longer available. Here, I'd like to refer you once again to Dustin's article, which tells you where and how you can 
pre-order the various models of the iPhone 15 series

Keep in mind, however, that the street prices for last year's iPhones are now lower than they were a year ago. The iPhone 14 Pro, for example, is already available for less than $1000, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max (256 GB) can be found with some discounts as well.

Conclusion


As always, a conclusion at the end of such a comparison is on shaky ground as long as we could only test one side in detail ourselves. Thus, we will only focus on technical data and information about the prices for the time being. Everything else will be put in order as soon as we could lay our hands on the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max.


Nevertheless, we can already state that the performance is supposed to improve to an extent that enables AAA games on the smartphone. In contrast, there is only relatively little change in the cameras. Thus, gamers might be interested in buying a new device, while photographers can relax and stay with the iPhone 14 Pro.




Definitely worth a look: 
These are the best smartphones in 2023




In my opinion, the other changes—USB-C, faster Wi-Fi, minimal design adjustments—are not very suitable to encourage you, as iPhone 14 Pro owners, to buy an iPhone 15 Pro. However, if you do not own either device, the purchase of the new models might make sense.


No matter which device you choose: You should get used to the idea of using the phone for three or four years—the devices are a) simply good enough to use for such a long time and b) simply too expensive to buy every year.


What do you think about the new Pro models from Cupertino? Did the presentation convince you? Are the 14er models still enough for you? And how long do you use your iPhones anyway?

He shared the gift he received from CEO Tim Cook and the tech giant.,"Work anniversaries are a significant milestone for employees, often marked with a token of appreciation, a bonus, or a small celebration. These gestures not only make the employees feel valued but also foster a positive work environment. Recently, an Apple employee, Marcos Alonso, celebrated his 10-year work anniversary and shared the unique gift he received from the tech giant and its CEO Tim Cook.
Marcos Alonso works as a Human Interface designer at Apple. He took to social media to share images and an unboxing video of his anniversary gift.
The gift was a solid metal memento, seemingly made of aluminium, with chamfered edges and a glossy Apple logo at the center. The memento also had the employee's name and the date of his ten-year service completion etched on it, along with the number ""10"" signifying the ten-year anniversary. The packaging of the gift resembled that of an Apple device, adding to its uniqueness. This special Apple product also included a heartfelt message from CEO Tim Cook.
The message read, ""Congratulations on reaching this milestone moment. The work you've done, the challenges you've met, and the breakthroughs you've made possible all contribute significantly to Apple's mission to change the world for the better. On behalf of everyone at Apple, thank you for all you bring to our journey together.""
A video by YouTuber DongleBookPro further detailed the making of this unique product. According to the note in the video, remnants from the production process were collected and reformulated to create a 100% recycled, custom alloy. This alloy was cast into long ingots, which were then sliced into blocks and machined to the finished size. The surface of the block was fine-blasted, and the edges were diamond-cut. The block was then anodized to seal the finish and create a protective layer. Finally, a stainless steel Apple logo was set into the center.
 
Since being shared, Alonso's post has garnered over half a million views and six thousand likes. One user commented, ""The hardest apple product to obtain.""
""I left Apple - 2 months short of 10 years..totally missing my 10-year plaque! I still have my 5-year plaque with Steve Jobs 'signature' on it...I hope that very dear to my techie heart. Lol - Congrats!"" another user wrote.

Foxconn is the main assembler of Apple iPhones and both companies are keen to move away from China and create alternative supply chains.

The company has also announced that it will be investing an additional Rs 3,300 crore in its manufacturing facility in Telangana. This will take the total investment of the company in the state to more than Rs 4,550 crore.
 
In September, Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the government was 'fully committed' to support Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn's ambitious plans to double its manufacturing capacity in the country.
 
'Fully committed to support and facilitate,' Vaishnaw said on X in response to Foxconn India representative V Lee's LinkedIn post to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 73rd birthday in which he said the company was 'aiming for another doubling of employment, FDI (foreign direct investment), and business size in India' by this time next year.

It may be noted that Apple has offered a unique lighting connector port on its iPhones for years. However, the EU has gone ahead with the universal charger plan as it would save about $271 million for consumers, while India said the move will reduce e-waste.
The EU's charging port rules come into effect in December 2024, and India wants the same to kick in by June 2025.
According to the Reuters report, in a closed-door meeting chaired by the IT ministry on November 28, Apple asked officials to exempt existing iPhone models from the rule as it would otherwise struggle to meet production targets set under the country's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme.
PLI provides fiscal incentives to electronics manufacturers in India for both new investments and annual increases in phone sales. This incentive program has been widely utilised by Apple suppliers, such as Foxconn, to enhance iPhone manufacturing operations within the country.
""If the regulation is implemented on earlier models of mobile phones, they (Apple) will not be able to meet the PLI targets,"" said Apple's regulatory and product compliance executives during the meeting. Two people familiar with the discussions said Apple did not quantify the production impact in the meeting and the IT ministry has decided to review its request and reach a decision later.
Universal charger rule could hit local production
The universal charger rule could be a big blow for Apple, which has seen its sales soar in India over the past few years. With India becoming Apple's next frontier after China, renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated 12-14 per cent of iPhone production in 2023 will be from India. He believes the number is set to rise to as much as 25 per cent next year.
Meanwhile, Apple's market share has been growing in India rapidly, currently at 6 per cent compared with just about 2 per cent around four years ago.
In such a scenario, changing the design of existing models to include a universal charger could be a massive blow to Apple. It may be noted that only iPhone 15 has the new universal charging port and Apple has reportedly told Indian officials that the 'design of the earlier products cannot be changed'.
Prabhu Ram, head of the Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia Research told Reuters that consumers in India prefer buying older models of iPhones which become cheaper with new launches. He said India's push for common chargers on existing iPhone models could hit Apple's production targets, subsequently impacting sales.
Apple has reportedly told officials it can comply with that timeline only if existing models are exempted from the rules. However, representatives of Apple have conveyed that it will take at least 18 months beyond 2024 if the existing models are not exempted from the universal charger rule.",indiatoday.in,1817,business,IN,en,India Today Business Desk,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202312/apple-iphones-055644559-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=kUpLFYIOApUwHM41f_JGaB00MreXBCV_,False,@indiatoday,7.2650466,55aec9c5f4b1150308531477ff9ec3f8
"Apple suspending sale of Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 models",Published Am Pt Dec.,2023-12-18 00:00:00,date,https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/business/2023/12/18/apple-suspends-sale-of-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-models,spectrumnews1.com,Apple is involved in patent dispute over blood oxygen sensor,"Apple announced Monday that it will stop selling its Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models in the United States. Neither watch will be available to order from the U.S. Apple website as of 3 p.m. ET Thursday.


Inventory will be pulled from Apple retailers after December 24, the company said in a statement.
 
The decision follows an International Trade Commission ruling about a patent dispute between Apple and the medical technology company, Masimo, which claims Apple stole its pulse oximetry technology. Apple first began incorporating blood oxygen sensors with its Apple Watch Series 6 in 2020.


A judge ruled in favor of Masimo in January, and the ITC issued its decision in October, triggering a 60-day Presidential Review Period during which President Biden is able to veto the ruling. The presidential review expires December 25.


Apple said its decision to stop selling the two Apple Watch models is a preemptive action to comply with the ITC decision.


'Apple's team work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness and safety features,' the company said in a statement. 'Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.'


Because they use blood oxygen monitoring, the Series 9 and Ultra 2 version of the Apple Watch are being suspended. The entry-level Apple Watch SE, which does not include the sensor, will remain on sale.


Under the ITC decision, the Series 9 and Ultra 2 are still available from non-Apple outlets, including Best Buy and Amazon. However, Apple will no longer be able to import them to the United States after December 25, which could impact their availability through other retailers.",mynews13.com,9350,business,US,en,"Published Am Pt Dec.,Susan Carpenter",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_Apple_Watch_Ultra_121823,False,,8.867734,5ff194f512784cfe52697010179a7002

The International Trade Commission (ITC) is set to enforce the ban on Christmas Day, citing alleged patent infringement by Masimo Corp related to the blood oxygen level measurement feature.
A report from Bloomberg revealed that Apple engineers are working on software updates to modify algorithms tied to the blood oxygen feature. If unsuccessful, Apple, facing a potential blow to its $17 billion business in the US, could only avoid the ban with a last-minute intervention from the White House.
To prepare for the ban, Apple is reportedly adjusting in-store promotions, excluding images of the affected models, and discontinuing online sales by Thursday. The lower-end SE watch will still be available for purchase.
Masimo, the company behind the patent claims, emphasizes the importance of companies adhering to the law. The dispute revolves around hardware patents, particularly the method of light emission into the skin for blood oxygen measurement.
Apple, optimistic about resolving the issue through software changes, plans to submit a workaround to the US customs agency for approval. However, Masimo argues that a software fix is insufficient and insists on necessary hardware modifications.
Evan Zimmerman, CEO of Edge, a patent drafting software company, highlights the rarity of import restrictions and their role in negotiation leverage. Resolving the dispute with software tweaks may prove challenging due to the broad scope of Masimo's patents.
In case of hardware modifications, the process could extend to at least three months, including production and shipment. Apple's meticulous internal testing, especially for medical features, adds complexity to the timeline.
The blood oxygen monitoring feature, introduced in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, monitors users' levels throughout the day. Apple's urgent efforts not only highlight the financial impact but also underscore the importance of maintaining the company's reputation for innovation and compliance.
The cited source reported that investors have responded cautiously, with Apple's stock experiencing a slight dip, while Masimo shares gained 3.2 percent. As the deadline approaches, Apple's ability to navigate this legal and engineering challenge remains uncertain, with potential implications for its flagship smartwatch business.",indiatoday.in,1817,business,IN,en,Ankita Garg,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202312/apple-watch-121648804-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=hsSLfm5WMdYULicwclIF5PSmvg9fK8uj,False,@indiatoday,5.901268,2b20c43e32897a3f23dac9b4661b67ca

T...","[Thomas Roth], aka [Ghidraninja], and author of the [Stacksmashing] YouTube channel, investigated Apple's Lightning port and created a cool debugging tool that allowed one to get JTAG on the device. Then, Apple went to USB-C for their new phones, and all his work went to waste. Oh well, start again — and take a look at USB-C.

Turns out, though, that the iPhone 15 uses the vendor-defined messages (VDM) capability of USB-PD to get all sorts of fun features out. Others had explored the VDM capabilities on Mac notebooks, and it turns out that the VDM messages on the phone are the same. Some more fiddling, and he got a serial port and JTAG up and running. But JTAG is locked down in the production devices, so that will have to wait for an iPhone 15 jailbreak. So he went poking around elsewhere.

He found some other funny signals that turned out to be System Power Management Interface (SPMI), one of the horribly closed and NDA-documented dialects owned by the MIPI Alliance. Digging around on the Interwebs, he found enough documentation to build an open-source SPMI plugin that he said should be out on his GitHub soon.

The end result? He reworked his old Lightning hardware tool for USB-C and poked around enough in the various available protocols to get a foothold on serial, JTAG, and SPMI. This is just the beginning, but if you're interested in playing with the new iPhone, this talk is a great place to start. Want to know all about USB-C?
