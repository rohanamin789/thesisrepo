0,Prosecutor fired after suing JPMorgan Chase,刘小卓,2023-01-03 00:00:00,date,http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202301/03/WS63b39182a31057c47eba7662.html,chinadaily.com.cn,The top prosecutor in the US Virgin Islands has been fired less than a week after she filed a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase of ignoring Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.,"By HENG WEILI in New York | China Daily Global | Updated: 2023-01-03 10:22 The top prosecutor in the US Virgin Islands has been fired less than a week after she filed a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase of ignoring Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.
Attorney General Denise George filed the lawsuit in Manhattan on Dec 27 alleging that the New York-headquartered financial services giant ""provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims"" of the late Epstein were paid.
On Sunday, Virgin Islands Governor Albert Bryan confirmed that George had been removed from the office amid reports he had been unaware of the lawsuit.
""I relieved Denise George of her duties as attorney general this weekend,"" Bryan said in a statement to media outlets, first published by The Virgin Islands Consortium. ""Assistant Attorney General Carol Thomas-Jacobs will serve as Acting Attorney General.""
The website reported that people familiar with the situation said Bryan ""had been frustrated"" with George for some time and that her action against the bank was ""the final straw"".
""I thank her for her service to the people of the territory during the past four years as attorney general and wish her the best in her future endeavors,"" the governor said.
The US Virgin Islands consist of the neighboring islands of St John and St Thomas, and St Croix to the south, and 50 other surrounding minor islands and cays. They are located in the Caribbean east of Puerto Rico.
In the lawsuit filed against JPMorgan Chase, George alleged that: ""JP Morgan turned a blind eye to evidence of human trafficking over more than a decade because of Epstein's own financial footprint, and because of the deals and clients that Epstein brought and promised to bring to the bank.
""These decisions were advocated and approved at the senior levels of JPMorgan, including by the former chief executive of its asset management division and investment bank, whose inappropriate relationship with Epstein should have been evident to the bank.
""Human trafficking was the principal business of the accounts Epstein maintained at JPMorgan,"" the suit said, adding that ""JPMorgan knowingly, negligently and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.""
The bank has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.
Epstein was a client of JPMorgan's high-end banking services for 15 years, a relationship that continued after his conviction in 2008 on two counts of soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl, The New York Times reported. The bank removed him as a client in 2013.
In November 2022, two of Epstein's victims filed a lawsuit against JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank accusing them of ignoring warning signs about Epstein sending underage girls and women to his private island, Little St. James Island, which he bought in 1998.
That lawsuit, which is cited and attached as an exhibit to the JPMorgan claim, was recently settled for $105 million, plus half the proceeds of the sale of Little St. James island, which is listed for $55 million, the Virgin Islands Daily News reported.
George had spent time and Justice Department resources pursuing that suit against Epstein's estate, which claimed his attorneys and associates fraudulently obtained tax benefits from the Virgin Islands government through the Economic Development Authority, according to the newspaper.
The estate and its co-executors, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, have denied any allegations of wrongdoing.
The latest case that George filed against JPMorgan Chase has been marked as related to the proposed class-action lawsuits filed in the same court, also against JPMorgan Chase, and Deutsche Bank.
The lawsuits are pending before US District Court Judge Jed Rakoff and have been scheduled for trial in the Southern District of New York in the summer of 2023.
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank filed motions Friday to dismiss the lawsuits.
""The time has come for the real enablers to be held responsible, especially his wealthy friends and the financial institutions that played an integral role,"" the plaintiffs' attorney Brad Edwards told The Wall Street Journal.
Epstein was 66 when he was found hanged in a federal detention center in Manhattan in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and abuse charges. A medical examiner ruled his death was a suicide.
Epstein's former girlfriend and confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, 61, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June after being convicted of sex-trafficking and abusing girls as young as 14.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,刘小卓,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202301/03/63b39182a31057c4b4b29c09.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,16.69397,a4df0d56e55c1410210c47ea637c8510,0.0,0.7699410915374756,0.0,0.0,0.7346211671829224,0.0
1,JPMorgan Chase Survey: Most Businesses Expect Recession in 2023,,2023-01-05 00:00:00,date,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230105005028/en/JPMorgan-Chase-Survey-Most-Businesses-Expect-Recession-in-2023,businesswire.com,"The majority of small and midsize U.S. business leaders anticipate a recession in 2023, according to JPMorgan Chase's 2023 annual Business Leaders Out","January 05, 2023 06:00 AM Eastern Standard Time NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The majority of small and midsize U.S. business leaders anticipate a recession in 2023, according to JPMorgan Chase's 2023 annual Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. In total, 65% of midsize businesses and 61% of small businesses expect a recession in the year ahead.



The heightened recession expectations come as businesses nationwide continue to combat inflation. Nearly all midsize businesses (91%) are experiencing inflation challenges, while 45% of small businesses list inflation as a top challenge for the year ahead, up from 20% one year ago. Inflation has forced small and midsize businesses to re-evaluate approaches to pricing, sourcing materials and running operations and has had widespread impacts, including:


Passing Costs onto Consumers: 83% of midsize businesses have passed at least some increased costs onto consumers and buyers, while 68% of small businesses have raised prices on select or all products and services.


Rising Business Expenses: 94% of small businesses say inflation has impacted expenses, with 38% noting that expenses have increased by 11% or more. Leading cost drivers for both small and midsize businesses include wages and benefits costs for hiring and retaining employees, shipping and other supply chain-related expenditures, including costs of raw materials.


Bracing for Longer-Term Increases: 82% of midsize businesses are likely to continue to increase prices to mitigate costs, while the majority of small businesses expect that higher costs for labor, rents, shipping and materials are here to stay.


'Inflation has been a challenging headwind impacting businesses of all sizes, across all industries,' said Ginger Chambless, head of research, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. 'While we have seen some encouraging signs that inflation has started to moderate and should cool over 2023, businesses may still want to consider adjustments to strategies, pricing or product mixes to help weather the storm in the near-term.'

Mixed Economic Views

Despite the shared consensus on a recession in 2023, small businesses remain more optimistic in their economic outlooks than midsize business leaders, who expressed much more downbeat views compared to this time last year.

Midsize businesses expressing optimism for the global economy declined to 8% from 34% one year ago and the number optimistic about the national economy fell to 22% from 50% at the start of 2022. Conversely, nearly half of small businesses, which are less likely to have exposure to national and international markets, expressed optimism for the national and global economy at 49% and 45%, respectively, which is similar to last year's sentiment.

High Performance Expectations

Small and midsize business leaders' outlook for their own company's performance remains high, with 72% of small businesses and 66% of midsize businesses expressing optimism for the year ahead.

More than two-thirds (69%) of small businesses expect increased revenue and sales in the year ahead and 65% anticipate greater profits in 2023. Similarly, 63% of midsize businesses expect increased revenue and sales in 2023, and 51% predict greater profits.

'Following the challenges of the last few years, it's encouraging to see the resilience of small business owners and leaders,' said Ben Walter, CEO, Chase Business Banking. 'The next economic cycle is always right around the corner, so our role is to help small business owners plan ahead so they can succeed in good times and bad.'

Help Still Wanted

Concerns of a recession and dimmed economic outlooks largely aren't restraining 2023 hiring plans, as 51% of small business leaders anticipate hiring full-time employees and 50% of midsize business leaders expect to increase headcount. To hire and retain employees, 67% of midsize businesses plan to increase wages and/or benefits and 43% plan to offer upskilling and training opportunities, while 42% of small businesses expect to increase wages. Small businesses' primary drivers for full-time hiring plans include expected sales growth and improved financial positions.

'While businesses may be cautious in their economic outlooks, their actions display a focus on growth and investing in their employees,' said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. 'Businesses are signaling that they're practiced in being nimble and prepared for several different scenarios, which are keys to operating effectively in today's economy.'

New Year's To-Do List

Businesses may consider focusing on the following considerations in their 2023 planning:


Stay In-Tune with Economic Trends: While business leaders are undoubtedly familiar with today's top economic headlines, they will want to keep a close eye on whether current trends related to the Federal Reserve, consumer spending, inflation, labor markets and more continue, abate or reverse in the year ahead. Learn more here.


Recession-Proof Your Business: Regardless of when or if a recession ultimately materializes, businesses can take steps today to remain flexible, bolster their balance sheet and even find opportunities amid volatility. Learn more here.


Optimize Working Capital: Working capital is a key indicator of businesses' financial health, and maintaining it is even more crucial in times of economic volatility. To manage working capital more effectively, businesses may want to consider utilizing supply chain finance and dynamic discount solutions, implementing more efficient inventory management and reworking current debt to reduce liabilities.

This report analyzes the paths that companies across financial sectors are charting for 2023.
 
As record-high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates, a cryptocurrency cooldown and the third year of a global pandemic squeeze the economy, financial institutions are plotting a course for 2023.
 
Banks, financial technology companies, credit unions and consulting firms are evaluating their risk appetites and leaning into digital-first strategies. Leaders across the industry are split on recession timelines, but their aggregate outlook on investments inspires hope for recovery. 
Key topics in the finance world like environmental, social and governance (ESG) action, potential regulations and innovation opportunities are still taking up real estate in financial firms' strategies, but banks and fintechs are also worried about inflation and its impact on their customers.

 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Latino Business Action Network (LBAN) is pleased to welcome JPMorgan Chase as a corporate sponsor to support Hispanic and Latino business owners nationally. LBAN is a Silicon Valley-based nonprofit that partners with 
Stanford University
 to empower Latino entrepreneurship across the country. JPMorgan Chase's sponsorship will support the three core pillars of LBAN:
Foundational research: explores challenges and opportunities for U.S. Latino entrepreneurship nationally, aiming to inform and influence policies.
Business Scaling Program at 
Stanford
: transformative scaling program for Latino Business owners from across the U.S., empowering them to scale their companies to the next level.
Ecosystem Development: cultivating networks of LBAN alumni, mentors, capital providers, and partners to improve access to capital and government and corporate contracts.
The Latino Business Action Network (LBAN) is pleased to welcome JPMorgan Chase as a corporate sponsor.
""We are grateful for the leadership that JPMorgan Chase is showing to support Hispanic and Latino business owners across the country,"" said 
Arturo Cazares
, CEO of LBAN, ""JPMorgan Chase is demonstrating a strong commitment to Latinos and the American economy. JPMorgan Chase is a powerful addition to our ecosystem and will help advance entrepreneurship nationally by bringing access to resources and capital to Latino and Latina business owners.""
Latinos created almost
 5 million businesses
 in the U.S. and are creating new companies faster than other groups. Those companies are young and growing revenues faster than the average. However, Latino entrepreneurs face extra and sometimes unfair challenges with access to opportunities and resources, including capital, expertise, and networking. Addressing these challenges is vital; LBAN's research shows that when U.S. Latino-owned businesses reach the average size of U.S. businesses, this will add trillions of dollars to the American economy.
""Supporting Latino entrepreneurs translates into a stronger economy for all,"" said 
Silvana Montenegro
, Global Head of Advancing Hispanics & Latinos. ""We are proud to join forces with the Latino Business Action Network to support the unique research and technical assistance programs that will help unlock the success and potential of Latino business owners across the country.""
Throughout this year, JPMorgan Chase will provide in-person and virtual programming to Latino entrepreneurs including workshops on how to leverage corporate supplier diversity programs and business roundtables for Latino entrepreneurs. This collaboration is part of the ongoing efforts led by JPMorgan Chase to drive inclusive economic growth and access to close the racial wealth gap for those who have been traditionally underserved, including Black and Hispanic and Latino communities.
JPMorgan Chase's support commenced at LBAN's 8th annual State of Latino Entrepreneurship Summit recently held at 
Stanford
, where JPMorgan Chase's representatives spoke on the importance of access to capital for Latino entrepreneurs and small business owners. The discussion touched also touched on the progress and impact of the firm's

 /PRNewswire/ -- 
QC Ware
 and 
JPMorgan Chase
 have completed a study of quantum ""deep hedging,"" paving the way for future increased risk mitigation capabilities in financial services.
JPMC logo
(PRNewswire)
In a new paper released on 
March 30th, 2023
, JPMorgan Chase and QC Ware examined two questions on how the practice of deep hedging—reducing risk for a portfolio utilizing data driven models that consider market frictions and trading constraints—might be improved with quantum computing. The researchers first examined whether existing classical deep hedging frameworks could be improved using quantum deep learning. Then, using quantum reinforcement learning, they studied whether a new quantum framework could be defined for deep hedging.
The study found that deep hedging on classical frameworks using quantum deep learning enabled models to be trained more efficiently. The research, conducted on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer, also demonstrated the potential for future computational speed-ups, which could be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Deep hedging on new quantum frameworks also enabled quantum value functions to:
Efficiently learn the expectation and distribution of returns
Offer improved performance via a quantum actor-critic reinforcement learning model
Appropriately train quantum policies.
The quantum application could offer improvements for deep hedging in both classical and quantum environments—it leverages quantum machine learning methods to improve at times accuracy and trainability on high-performance GPU hardware, which will be helpful in financial services as quantum computing becomes more commercially accessible.
""We are taking deep hedging to its next logical evolutionary step,"" said Iordanis Kerenidis, head of Quantum Algorithms at QC Ware. ""The results achieved with JPMorgan Chase demonstrate the huge potential and applicability of quantum machine learning, both today, by using quantum ideas to provide novel models with classical hardware, and also leveraging the continuously more powerful quantum hardware we anticipate in the future.""
""As quantum computing continues to mature, JPMorgan Chase's leading position will only be further solidified via future-ready algorithms that will produce continually improving results,"" said 
Marco Pistoia
, Managing Director, Head of Global Technology Applied Research, JPMorgan Chase. ""We're glad to be able to further optimize already sterling hedging strategies, not only to deliver value for investors, but also to allow for more frequent and sophisticated hedging of positions in the market. This work helps to pave the way for the bank to incorporate quantum computing into its deep hedging.""

NEW YORK — Regulators seized troubled First Republic Bank early Monday, making it the second-largest bank failure in  history, and promptly sold all of its deposits and most of its assets to JPMorgan Chase Bank in a bid to head off further banking turmoil in the 
 
San Francisco-based First Republic is the third midsize bank to fail in two months. The only larger bank failure was Washington Mutual, which collapsed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and was also taken over by JPMorgan.
 
First Republic has struggled since the March collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and investors and depositors had grown increasingly worried it might not survive because of a high amount of uninsured deposits and exposure to low interest rate loans.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said early Monday that First Republic Bank's 84 branches in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank and depositors will have full access to all of their deposits.
 
Regulators worked through late last week and this weekend to find a way forward before  stock markets opened. They solicited bids for First Republic Bank's assets and once again turned to JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank, with a reputation as a dealmaker during times of crisis. Treasury officials also enlisted JPMorgan last month to spearhead a $30 billion funding package for First Republic.
 
""Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,"" said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.
 
As of April 13, First Republic had approximately $229 billion in total assets and $104 billion in total deposits, the FDIC said. The FDIC estimated its deposit insurance fund would take a $13 billion hit from taking First Republic into receivership. Its rescue of Silicon Valley Bank cost the fund a record $20 billion.
 
Before Silicon Valley Bank failed, First Republic had a banking franchise that was the envy of most of the industry. Its clients — mostly the rich and powerful — rarely defaulted on their loans. The bank has made much of its money making low-cost loans to the wealthy, which reportedly included Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 
Flush with deposits from the well-heeled, First Republic saw total assets more than double from $102 billion at the end of 2019's first quarter, when its full-time workforce was 4,600.
 
But the vast majority of its deposits, like those in Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, were uninsured — that is, above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC. And that worried analysts and investors. If First Republic were to fail, its depositors might not get all their money back.
 
Those fears were crystalized in the bank's recent quarterly results. First Republic said customers rushed to pull out more than $100 billion in deposits following the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank. Unlike bank runs throughout history, First Republic's demise was fueled by the speed of social media and digital withdrawals that can be made in seconds from a cell phone.
 
San Francisco-based First Republic said the $30 billion in funding it received in mid-March from a group of large banks helped it stanch the bleeding. To turn itself around, the bank planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including the low interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022.
 
Investors were skeptical, and the devastating quarterly report sent them running for the exits. First Republic shares fell 75% last week and closed Friday at $3.51. Any remaining shareholders are likely to get wiped out. The shares traded at $115 on March 8, right before Silicon Valley Bank failed.
 
The Federal Reserve and FDIC, which regulate the banking industry along with the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, could face renewed criticism over their handling of First Republic. Both acknowledged Friday in separate reports that lax supervision had contributed to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
 
For Dimon and JPMorgan, there may be a sense of déjà vu: Back in 2008, Dimon was the go-to banker for Washington to find private solutions for that banking crisis and JPMorgan acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.
 
In a statement, JPMorgan portrayed the First Republic deal as beneficial both to the financial system and the company. As part of the agreement, the FDIC will share losses with JPMorgan on First Republic's loans. JPMorgan expects the addition of First Republic to add $500 million to its net income per year, although it expects to incur $2 billion in costs integrating First Republic into its operations over the next 18 months. .

further banking turmoil
 in the U.S.
 
San Francisco-based First Republic
 is the third midsize bank to fail in two months. It is the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history, behind only 
Washington Mutual
, which collapsed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and was also taken over by JPMorgan.
 
First Republic has struggled since the March 
collapses of Silicon Valley Bank
 and 
Signature Bank
 and investors and depositors had grown increasingly worried it might not survive because of its high amount of uninsured deposits and exposure to low interest rate loans. 
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said early Monday that First Republic Bank's 84 branches in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank and depositors will have full access to all of their deposits.
 
Regulators worked through the weekend to find a way forward before 
U.S. stock markets
 opened. Markets in many parts of the world were closed for May 1 holidays Monday. The two markets in Asia that were open, in Tokyo and Sydney, rose.
 
'Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,' said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. 
 
As of April 13, First Republic had approximately $229 billion in total assets and $104 billion in total deposits, the FDIC said. 
 
At the end of last year, 
the Federal Reserve ranked it 14th in size
 among U.S. commercial banks. The FDIC estimated its deposit insurance fund would take a $13 billion hit from taking First Republic into receivership. Its rescue of Silicon Valley Bank cost the fund a record $20 billion.
 
Before Silicon Valley Bank failed, First Republic had a banking franchise that was the envy of most of the industry. Its clients — mostly the rich and powerful — rarely defaulted on their loans. The bank has made much of its money making low-cost loans to the wealthy, which reportedly included Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 
Flush with deposits from the well-heeled, First Republic saw total assets more than double from $102 billion at the end of 2019's first quarter, when its full-time workforce was 4,600.
 
But the vast majority of its deposits, like those in Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, were uninsured — that is, above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC. And that worried analysts and investors. If First Republic were to fail, its depositors might not get all their money back.
 
Those fears were crystalized in the bank's recent quarterly results. The bank said 
depositors pulled more than $100 billion out
 of the bank during April's crisis. San Francisco-based First Republic said that it was only able to stanch the bleeding after a group of large banks 
stepped in to save it with $30 billion
 in uninsured deposits.
 
Since the crisis, First Republic has been looking for a way to quickly turn itself around. The bank planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including the low interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022.
 
Investors remained skeptical. The bank's executives have taken no questions from investors or analysts since the bank reported its results, causing First Republic's stock to sink further.
 
And it's hard to profitably restructure a balance sheet when a firm has to sell off assets quickly and has fewer bankers to find opportunities for the bank to invest in. It took years for banks like Citigroup and Bank of America to return to profitability after the global financial crisis 15 years ago, and those banks had the benefit of a government-aided backstop to keep them going.

It's the third mid-size bank to fail in less than two months. The only larger bank failure in U.S. history was Washington Mutual, which collapsed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and was also taken over by JPMorgan in a similar government-orchestrated deal.
 
""Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,"" said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.
 
First Republic's 84 branches opened on Monday as branches of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the bank's $92 billion in deposits and $203 billion in loans and other securities. The bank's shareholders are likely to be wiped out as part of the deal.
 
Dimon said in a conference call with both reporters and investors that he believed ""this part of this (banking) crisis is over."" Other mid-size banks reported their results last week, and the vast majority of them showed deposits had stabilized and profits remained relatively healthy. The outlier was First Republic.
 
Before this year, First Republic was the envy of the banking industry. Its well-appointed branches served warm cookies to its clients -- who were almost exclusively the rich and powerful. Its bankers lured in wealthy clients with low-cost mortgages and attractive savings rates in order to sell them on higher-profit businesses like wealth management and brokerage accounts.
 
In return, the wealthy rarely defaulted on their loans and parked substantial sums of money in the bank that could be lent elsewhere.
 
But that business model of catering to the rich became a liability with the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. These banks had large amount of uninsured deposits -- that is, deposits above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC. As was the case with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, First Republic clients with large accounts were quick to pull their money at the first sign of trouble.

""Too many (First Republic) customers showed their true loyalties were to their own fears,"" wrote Timothy Coffey, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, in a note to investors.
 
A coalition of a dozen banks pulled together a $30 billion funding package for First Republic last month that, for awhile, seemed to stanch the bleeding of deposits. But it became increasingly clear that First Republic was on borrowed time: It needed to find a buyer, or find new forms of funding to replace the deposits that had left the bank.
 
First Republic planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including low-interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022. But it was seen as too little, too late by analysts. The bank seemed to be on the brink of failure for weeks.
 
The $30 billion package ""bought time when time was needed"" for First Republic, said Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, in a call with reporters.
 
Last Monday, First Republic reported its first-quarter results and stunned analysts and investors when it revealed that $100 billion in deposits had flowed out of the bank, most in mid-March immediately after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Its executives took no questions from analysts on an earning conference call. First Republic's stock plunged more than 50% the day after the report.
 
By mid last week, it became clear government intervention in First Republic was necessary. Treasury officials asked banks to submit bids for First Republic, and bankers and regulators worked through the weekend to find a way forward.
 
Once again JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank with a reputation as a dealmaker during times of crisis, became the government's go-to bank. Treasury officials had enlisted JPMorgan last month to lead the $30 billion rescue package. Back in 2008, Dimon was the go-to banker for Washington to find private solutions for that banking crisis and JPMorgan acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.
 
The Federal Reserve and FDIC, which regulate the banking industry along with the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, could face renewed criticism over their handling of First Republic. Both acknowledged Friday in separate reports that lax supervision had contributed to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
 
""These banks were allowed to get too big too quickly when interest rates were low,"" Coffey said in an interview.
 
There could also now be questions about the size of JPMorgan Chase, which has more than $3 trillion in assets and is by far the biggest of the ""too big to fail"" institutions around the world.
 
Regulators ""permitted the country's biggest bank to get even bigger. We expect this will be a Democratic focus for months,"" said Jaret Seiberg, banking analyst at TD Cowen.
 
JPMorgan is so big that by law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic because no one bank can have more than a 10% market share of deposits in the U.S. It is only because First Republic failed that JPMorgan was able to step in.
 
In a statement, JPMorgan portrayed the First Republic deal as beneficial both to the financial system and the company. As part of the agreement, the FDIC will share losses with JPMorgan on First Republic's loans. The FDIC expects First Republic's failure to cost the insurance fund roughly $13 billion, which is funded by bank assessments, not by taxpayers.

lawsuit by the U.S. Virgin Islands
 accusing it of empowering Jeffrey Epstein to abuse teenage girls by arguing in court papers that it was the islands, not the bank, that enabled the financier to commit his crimes.
 
Lawyers for the bank said in the Manhattan federal court filing that the government of the Virgin Islands was complicit, letting high ranking officials be bought off by Epstein and actively working with him while 'reaping the benefits of his wealth.'
 
'He gave them money, advice, influence, and favors. In exchange, they shielded and even rewarded him,' providing lucrative tax breaks worth millions of dollars, they wrote.
 
Most troubling, they said, was that officials from the islands 'protected Epstein, fostering the perfect conditions for Epstein's criminal conduct to continue undetected.' 
 
The lawyers added: 'For two decades, and for long after JPMC exited Epstein as a client, the entity that most directly failed to protect public safety and most actively facilitated and benefited from Epstein's continued criminal activity was the plaintiff in this case — the USVI government itself.'
 
The Virgin Islands, where Epstein had an estate, sued 
JPMorgan
 last year, saying its investigation revealed that the financial services giant enabled Epstein's recruiters to pay victims and was 'indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.'
 
In their filing Tuesday, the bank's lawyers said Virgin Islands officials looked the other way when Epstein went through its airports with girls and young women as he donated generously to political campaigns. The lawyers said officials were lenient with requirements that he register as a sex offender, doing inspections of his residence that were 'cursory at best.""
 
'In sum, in exchange for Epstein's cash and gifts, USVI made life easy for him,' the lawyers said. 'The government mitigated any burdens from his sex offender status. And it made sure that no one asked too many questions about his transport and keeping of young girls on his island.'
 
Portions of the filing were heavily redacted. It asked Judge Jed Rakoff to reject the islands' attempts to prevent the bank from using defenses at trial that would expose the islands' role in Epstein's dealings.
 
The lawyers wrote that 'alleged damages must be balanced against the considerable benefits that USVI reaped from its facilitation of Epstein's crimes.'
 
Lawyers for the U.S. Virgin Islands did not return email messages seeking comment.
 
Epstein was 66 when he took his life in August 2019 in a Manhattan federal jail where he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to charges of sexually abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14 years old.

This case involving reformation of a security deed is before us for a fourth time. In 2021, the trial court entered final judgment reforming the deed and declaring that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A., has a superior interest in the subject property. Daniel David DelPiano, the purported property owner, appealed to this Court. JPMorgan moved to dismiss the appeal, claiming that DelPiano lacked standing because he did not own the property. We remanded the case for the trial court to resolve the standing issue, which it has now done adversely to DelPiano. He appeals again, but we agree with the trial court that he lacked standing, and we therefore affirm. The relevant background facts are detailed in our opinion resolving the second appeal in this case, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. v. DelPiano
, 356 Ga. App. 354 (847 SE2d 369) (2020) ('
DelPiano II
'): [I]n 2004, DelPiano and his wife Pamela decided to buy a home in Alpharetta . . . for $3.3 million. The property was purchased in Pamela's name, and she took out a $2.64 million loan from Washington Mutual Bank ('WaMu') to finance the transaction. At the closing in March 2005, Pamela executed the necessary loan documents, including an adjustable rate note, through which she promised to repay the loan, and a security deed granting WaMu a security interest in the property. Pamela's signature on the security deed was notarized by the closing attorney. Signature lines for an 'unofficial' witness, however, were inadvertently left blank during the transaction. . . . Despite the missing signature, the closing attorney recorded the security deed in the Fulton County deed records on April 1, 2005. Pamela began making monthly payments on the WaMu loan, but she stopped paying in March 2006, and the loan went into default. DelPiano and Pamela divorced in May 2008. Pursuant to the parties' divorce settlement, DelPiano assumed sole responsibility for the outstanding balance of the loan, and Pamela quitclaimed her interest in the property to DelPiano in 2010. DelPiano, however, made no payments on the loan following the divorce. WaMu owned the adjustable rate promissory note and related security deed until 2008, when WaMu was acquired by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company ('FDIC'). On September 25, 2008, the FDIC sold WaMu's assets, including the note and security deed, to JPMorgan. According to JPMorgan, it discovered the missing signature on the security deed in 2011, through discussions with the bank's foreclosure counsel. In 2015, a document assigning the FDIC's interest in the security deed to JPMorgan was recorded in the Fulton County deed records. Approximately one year later, on May 17, 2016, JPMorgan filed the instant action, seeking 'to correct the inadvertent attestation omission' in the security deed and to obtain a declaration that the security deed 'is valid, enforceable, and occupies a first priority security interest and lien position on the [p]roperty[.]' JPMorgan named several defendants, including DelPiano (the property owner) and the United States of America (on behalf of the Department of Justice), which had filed restitution liens on the property relating to criminal proceedings against DelPiano. Id. at 355-356.
[1]
 Pamela DelPiano was also named as a defendant. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to JPMorgan and ordered that the security deed be reformed. DelPiano appealed,
[2]
 and we reversed, holding that Pamela's admissions by default could not bind him. 
DelPiano v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A.
, 345 Ga. App. 151, 154-155 (812 SE2d 506) (2018) ('
DelPiano I
'). The trial court subsequently denied JPMorgan's motions for summary judgment and granted motions for summary judgment filed by DelPiano and the United States, ruling that JPMorgan's complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitation. JPMorgan appealed, and we again reversed the trial court. 
DelPiano II
, 356 Ga. App. 354. We ruled that JPMorgan's suit was not time-barred, id. at 356-358 (1), and we vacated the trial court's denial of JPMorgan's summary judgment motions and remanded for consideration of the arguments presented in those motions, id. at 359-360 (3). Following remittitur, JPMorgan filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion and entered a final judgment reforming the security deed and declaring that JPMorgan has a superior interest in the subject property. DelPiano appealed. JPMorgan moved to dismiss the appeal, claiming that it had recently learned that DelPiano did not own the subject property and therefore lacked standing to appeal. Because the question of DelPiano's standing involved facts not in the record and required the submission of new evidence, we remanded the case to the trial court to make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law on that issue. 
DelPiano v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A.
, Case No. A22A0373 (remanded Jan. 31, 2022) ('
DelPiano III
'). After the remittitur issued in 
DelPiano III
, the trial court entered an order barring JPMorgan from foreclosing on the property during the pendency of the litigation. The parties then submitted evidence on the standing issue showing the following undisputed facts: Pamela acquired the subject property by warranty deed in 2005 and quitclaimed it to DelPiano in 2010. In 2016, JPMorgan filed this lawsuit, naming DelPiano as a defendant because he was the current owner of the property. On September 12, 2017, DelPiano quitclaimed the property to the Love Family Trust, LLC ('LFT'), a 'single member Florida limited liability company' of which DelPiano was 'the sole managing member.' DelPiano claims that his attorney advised him to make this conveyance to protect himself from personal liability, as tenants at the subject property 'were throwing pool/lake parties and [DelPiano] was concerned with someone getting drunk and either getting hurt or drowning in the pool or the lake.' However, DelPiano did not file or record the deed until more than four years later, on November 2, 2021. Nevertheless, in a 2019 deposition in this case, DelPiano testified that he owned the property free and clear of any mortgage lien. DelPiano further testified that it was 'possible' that the property may at one time have been 'owned by the trust,' but '[i]f it was deeded over to the trust, it would have been recorded and there would be a record of it,' which contradicted the records discussed above. Regardless, DelPiano denied that he, himself, had transferred the property to a trust, and he confirmed that he was then the current owner pursuant to Pamela's 2010 quitclaim deed. JPMorgan later advertised a nonjudicial foreclosure of the property scheduled for November 2, 2021. On October 20, 2021, the attorney who was then representing DelPiano in this action wrote to counsel for JPMorgan that the planned foreclosure was improper because it 'violate[d] the supersedeas triggered by [DelPiano] having filed a notice of appeal' — i.e., 
DelPiano III
 — from the trial court's final order. This letter did not mention DelPiano's 2017 transfer of the property to LFT. On November 1, 2021, the day before the scheduled sale, JPMorgan's counsel received an e-mail from an attorney representing LFT. The e-mail advised that LFT owned the property and had filed a bankruptcy petition to stop the foreclosure. This petition was signed by DelPiano on behalf of LFT. The foreclosure did not proceed. After receiving the property pursuant to the 2017 quitclaim deed, LFT executed two further deeds to the property. On October 28, 2021, 'DANIEL DELPIANO, of THE LOVE FAMILY TRUST, LLC . . . (the 'Grantor'),' purported to convey the property to 'THE LOVE FAMILY TRUST, [LL]C . . . (the 'Grantee').' Then, on January 7, 2022, LFT executed a 'Corrective Quitclaim Deed' purporting to correct the October 28, 2021 deed to show that LFT actually had conveyed 50 percent to DelPiano and 50 percent to LFT. This latest deed recited that its purpose was 'to correct the state of incorporation of the grantor, and add the second grantee erroneously omitted on [the October 28, 2021 quitclaim deed].'
[3]
 Following briefing, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue at which DelPiano called an 'expert in the area of title examinations' to show that DelPiano owned the property from 2010 to 2021, during the pendency of this litigation. The expert initially testified that the 2017 deed from DelPiano to LFT was 'not effective' until it was recorded on November 2, 2021. According to the expert, the property was solely owned by LFT from that date until the 'corrective' deed was recorded in January 2022 granting 50 percent of the property to DelPiano. On cross-examination, however, the expert conceded that '[a]s far as the parties were concerned,' LFT became the owner of the property as of the date of the 2017 quitclaim deed. After the hearing, the trial court entered an order finding that DelPiano 'has lacked standing to litigate this case.' The court found that DelPiano had concealed from the court and JPMorgan his 2017 conveyance of the property to LFT until the day before the scheduled foreclosure. As a result of that conveyance, the court ruled, DelPiano did not own the property between the date of the 2017 conveyance and the court's June 2021 final judgment and therefore lacked standing to litigate any issues in the case, including any defenses to JPMorgan's claim to reform the security deed. Accordingly, the court vacated its earlier order preventing foreclosure. DelPiano appeals. 1. DelPiano does not quibble with the basic tenet of standing that '[a] person may only challenge a ruling that has adversely affected his or her own rights.' 
Associated Credit Union v. Pinto
, 297 Ga. App. 605, 606 (677 SE2d 789) (2009). Further, he has dropped his argument that the 2017 quitclaim deed transferring the property to LFT was ineffective until its recording in 2021. See generally 
Lionheart Legend v. Norwest Bank Minnesota N. A.
, 253 Ga. App. 663, 667 (560 SE2d 120) (2002) ('as between the parties themselves,' an unrecorded deed 'is valid and binding'; to hold otherwise would 'allow the parties to an unrecorded deed to profit by their failure to record the deed') (citation and punctuation omitted). Rather, DelPiano argues on appeal that despite his 2017 transfer to LFT, he continued to own the property because (a) LFT never accepted the deed and (b) the January 2022 corrective deed retroactively vested him with a half-interest in the property. Both arguments fail. (a) DelPiano maintains that '[t]he property was never effectively conveyed to [LFT] because [LFT] never accepted it.' However, DelPiano did not make this argument in the trial court and therefore has waived it. See, e.g., 
OVIP v. Blockbuster Textiles
, 289 Ga. App. 276, 278 (1) (656 SE2d 907) (2008) ('[I]ssues presented for the first time on appeal furnish nothing for us to review . . . One may not abandon an issue in the trial court and on appeal raise questions or issues neither raised nor ruled on below.') (citations and punctuation omitted). Even if DelPiano had not waived the argument, it lacks merit. Under Georgia law, '[d]elivery of a deed is essential to the conveyance of title thereby,' and delivery 'includes acceptance by the grantee.' 
Stallings v. Newton
, 110 Ga. 875, 880 (36 SE 227) (1900); see also 
Smith v. Tibbits
, 359 Ga. App. 362, 365-366 (1) (857 SE2d 820) (2021). Thus, '[t]he acceptance of a deed of bargain and sale is essential to a complete delivery.' 
Stinson v. Woodland Bank
, 154 Ga. 254, 257 (114 SE 181) (1922). If a grantee 'retains a deed without objection, acceptance will be inferred' because '[i]t is a presumption of law that a party accepts whatever is for its benefit; but this presumption may be rebutted.' 
Stallings
, 110 Ga. at 880 (citation and punctuation omitted). The 2017 quitclaim deed recites that DelPiano 'signed, sealed, and delivered' the deed to LFP, which 'receive[d] the property from [DelPiano] in fee simple as the sole owner.' This recitation created a presumption that the deed was duly delivered and accepted. See 
Smith
, 359 Ga. App. at 366-367 (1). DelPiano argues that this presumption was rebutted because there was no evidence that LFT accepted the deed in writing, as required by Georgia procedural law governing limited liability corporations. But LFT is a Florida limited liability corporation and therefore Florida law — not Georgia law — 'govern[s] its organization and internal affairs.' OCGA § 14-11-701 (a). DelPiano cites no authority for the proposition that LFT's presumed acceptance of the 2017 deed was improper under Florida law. He therefore has not met his burden of rebutting the presumption that LFT accepted title to the property. (b) DelPiano next argues that 'the corrective deed executed and recorded in 2022 reinstated at least a one-half interest in the property [to DelPiano] as of the date of the original deed.' We disagree. Although DelPiano implicitly contends that the corrective deed 'related back' to the 2017 quitclaim deed, on its face the corrective deed purported only to correct 'that certain quitclaim deed recorded at deed book 64778, page 202, Fulton County, Georgia Records' — i.e., the October 2021 deed in which LFT quitclaimed the property to itself. The corrective deed did not mention — and therefore did not 'correct' or relate back to — the 2017 deed quitclaiming the property from DelPiano to LFT. And even if the corrective deed did purport to amend the 2017 deed, '[t]he effective date of a corrective deed . . . is the date of the filing of that corrective deed, as there is no date-back feature.' 
Green Rivers Forest v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.
, 200 B. R. 956, 959 (Bankr. M. D. Ga. 1996). Thus, the amendment would not have been effective until the corrective deed was recorded in 2022 — 
after
 the parties had litigated the merits of the case and the trial court had entered final judgment in favor of JPMorgan. 2. DelPiano next contends that, even if he lacked standing, the trial court should not have dismissed the case, but instead should have joined LFT as an indispensable party-defendant under OCGA § 9-11-19.
[4]
 DelPiano, however, has waived this argument. DelPiano never sought to add LFT as a defendant — either before or after final judgment — even though he has known since 2017 that LFT owned the property. It was not until April 2022, after the latest remand, that DelPiano argued for the first time, in a response brief, that 'the proper remedy would have been to allege that [LFT] was the real party in interest, and give Del[P]iano an opportunity to . . . substitute the LLC for himself as the proper defendant.'
[5]
 However, DelPiano never filed a motion to substitute parties and never obtained a ruling from the trial court on this issue. Accordingly, we have nothing to review. See 
In re Declaration of Judicial Emergency
, 358 Ga. App. 48, 53 (1) (853 SE2d 366) (2020) ('Without a ruling by the trial court on a particular issue, there is nothing for this Court to review upon appeal.'). See also 
Olagbegi v. Hutto
, 320 Ga. App. 436, 437 (1) (740 SE2d 190) (2013) ('[I]t is the duty of counsel to obtain a ruling on his motions or objections, and the failure to do so will ordinarily result in a waiver.') (citation and punctuation omitted). 3. Finally, DelPiano argues that the trial court erred by failing to 'review and rule on the unadjudicated issues raised in the outstanding motions for summary judgment' and by granting 'equitable relief to JPMorgan without conducting a trial to balance the equities.' However, DelPiano has not met his burden of showing that the trial court erred when it determined that he lacked standing to litigate any issues in the case. In light of DelPiano's lack of standing, these issues are moot.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.17% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through May 15, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

35,"Business Leaders Hold Mixed Views on Recession Likelihood, JPMorgan Chase Survey Finds",,2023-07-17 00:00:00,date,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230717345699/en/Business-Leaders-Hold-Mixed-Views-on-Recession-Likelihood-JPMorgan-Chase-Survey-Finds,businesswire.com,"Despite continued macroeconomic challenges, just under half of US midsize business leaders expect a recession in the second half of 2023, finds JPMorg","NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Despite continued macroeconomic challenges, just under half of US midsize business leaders expect a recession in the second half of 2023, finds JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Midyear Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. Forty-five percent of business leaders anticipate a recession before year-end or believe the economy is already in one, down from 65% six months ago. Alternatively, 36% of respondents do not expect a recession this year, and 20% are uncertain whether one will occur.

The moderated recession fears come as the majority of business leaders remain pessimistic or neutral in their economic outlooks, though optimism for the global and national economy slightly increased from the start of 2023.

The share of business leaders who are pessimistic about the global economy for the year ahead fell to 39% from 60%, while 46% hold neutral outlooks. Only 15% of respondents are optimistic about the global economy, which is up from 8% six months ago.

The percentage of business leaders expressing pessimism about the national economy dropped to 37% from 43% at the start of 2023. Fewer than 3 in 10 survey respondents (29%) are bullish on the national economy, but this is an increase from 22% six months ago.

Two-thirds of respondents (67%) remain confident in their company's performance for the next year, roughly in line with sentiment from six months ago. Similarly, business expectations remain largely unchanged from the start of the year, with the majority of business leaders anticipating increased revenue or sales (59%) and profits (51%). Business leaders did project lowered expectations for hiring, with under half (42%) expecting to add headcount in the next year. The majority of business leaders (57%) expect their credit needs to remain consistent in the year ahead.

'The resilience of US consumer spending and other tailwinds has helped the economy have a stronger start to 2023 than expected, impacting business leaders' conviction of a recession occurring this year,' said Ginger Chambless, Head of Research, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. 'Still, businesses continue to face the persistent challenges of inflation, interest rates and labor shortages, making it critical for leaders to position their companies for stability in an uncertain economic environment by maintaining strong liquidity and adequate cash balances.'

High cost constraints continue

Business leaders cite labor shortages, inflation and competition as the top external threats or risks to their companies. In particular, inflation continues to impact the bottom line and pricing decisions, even as there are signs it has recently moderated.

Nearly 8 in 10 business leaders (79%) say their costs of doing business have risen in the past six months, compared with 91% at the beginning of the year.

Three-quarters (75%) of survey respondents are likely to continue to raise prices to mitigate costs.

Nearly 7 in 10 leaders (68%) want the Fed to pause rate hikes in the current economic landscape.

Innovation Economy outlook muddled amid disruption

As the Innovation Economy sector – encompassing high-growth companies and venture-backed startups across industries – was heavily impacted by disruption in the banking sector earlier this year, optimism dipped among its business leaders; yet, their economic forecasts remain bright compared to midsize business leaders across other industries.

Half (50%) of Innovation Economy leaders surveyed are positive on the national economy for the year ahead and 42% are hopeful about the global economy, though these numbers have fallen from 58% and 57%, respectively, six months ago.

More than three-quarters of respondents (76%) are optimistic about their own company's performance, a drop of nine percentage points since the beginning of the year.

Most Innovation Economy executives maintain high business expectations, as 76% expect to increase revenue or sales and 68% anticipate increased profits in the year ahead.

Slightly more than 6 in 10 Innovation Economy business leaders (63%) report their costs of doing business have risen over the last six months. This segment is more mixed in its views on the Fed's response to the current economic landscape, with 44% calling for a pause to rate hikes and 42% believing the Fed should raise rates, even as 28% of Innovation Economy leaders cite the cost of debt as the top external threat or risk to their businesses.

'The overall confidence and continued high expectations of Innovation Economy business leaders provide strong evidence of their resiliency and entrepreneurial spirit,' said Melissa Smith, Co-Head of Innovation Economy and Head of Specialized Industries, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. 'Even amid unforeseen challenges in the first half of 2023, they've remained focused on tackling some of today's most pressing issues and ultimately growing their businesses during this pivotal moment.'

AI business use cases are on the rise

In recent months, businesses have faced volatility not only from economic factors, but also from new and more widespread uses of emerging technologies, most notably artificial intelligence (AI). However, business leaders are split on the adoption of AI tools, such as generative AI and language processing software.

Thirty-eight percent of respondents are already using or considering using AI tools, but 46% neither use nor plan to use them.

Of the businesses adopting or considering adopting AI tools, the majority (53%) are integrating them into business operations, and 46% are tapping the new technology for internal and/or external communications.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.26% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 3, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The matchmaking event connected diverse business owners with public and private supplier decision-makers, including the City of Phoenix, the City of Scottsdale, APS, JPMorgan Chase & Co., SRP and Via West Group, with opportunities from the construction and facilities maintenance, finance and insurance, transportation, manufacturing and professional services industries.

Dwight Warren, executive director and market manager of Government and Not-for-Profit Banking at JPMorgan Chase, kicked off the special event. In addition, Dr. Velma Trayham, founder of the Millionaire Mastermind Academy and creator of IMPACT AZ, and Robin Reed, CEO of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Arizona, welcomed attendees and shared perspectives on the importance of greater supplier diversity.

'Arizona's largest supplier diversity readiness accelerator is already making significant progress towards our goal of advancing more than 250 diverse businesses past the $1 million threshold,' said Dr. Trayham.'We are incredibly proud to demonstrate needed leadership in supporting and growing diverse business opportunities across the wonderful state of Arizona.'

The solutions-driven accelerator program is expanding procurement opportunities with corporations and government entities. Fortune 500 companies spend about 2% annually on minority-owned suppliers, well short of the 10% to 15% spending goals many corporations establish.

1 All YieldMaxTM ETFs have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.

2 The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income , remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying such distribution by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF's most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF's NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.

3 The 30-Day SEC Yield representsinvestment income, which excludes option income , earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended August 31, 2023, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF's share price at the end of the 30-Day period.

4 Each ETF's strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset's shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset's shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.

About ZEGA Financial

Founded in 2011, ZEGA Financial is an SEC-registered investment adviser and investment manager that specializes in derivatives. The firm leverages technology, data, experience, and proprietary strategies to craft products and services for advisors and individual investors. ZEGA Financial helps investors successfully navigate volatile and uncertain markets through innovative hedging strategies. The firm's founding principles grew out of the bestselling book co-authored by Jay Pestrichelli, ZEGA's CEO and Co-Founder, entitled'Buy and Hedge, the Five Iron Rules for Investing Over the Long Term.' His book highlights how to bridge the complicated nature of options investing with the needs of the everyday investor.

Risk Disclosures

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. JPM Risk . The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of JPM. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of JPM, even though it does not. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund's call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of JPM and, in turn, the Fund's returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund's investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund's investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current monthly income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next . Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund's call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns and, in turn, the Fund's returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund's holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is'non-diversified,' it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk . The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by JPM over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk . Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

Investors in the Fund(s) will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying stock.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.17% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through September 4, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

This decision involves","(MENAFN) JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, is set to sell a portion of his family's stake in the bank for the first time. This decision involves offloading 1 million out of the total 8.6 million shares, with the primary motivations cited as ""financial diversification and tax-planning purposes,"" according to a regulatory filing. The sale will yield nearly USD141 million for Dimon, although it represents less than 10 percent of his overall stake, which is estimated to be worth approximately USD1.07 billion. The transaction is scheduled for 2024, and Dimon intends to utilize stock trading plans for the sale, adhering to guidelines outlined under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as indicated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



This significant divestiture, however, is not connected to leadership succession, as clarified by a spokesperson for the company. Jamie Dimon assumed the leadership role at JPMorgan in late 2005 and was subsequently appointed as chairman and president the following year. The SEC emphasized that Dimon maintains a strong belief in the company's robust prospects, and his remaining stake in the organization will continue to be substantial.



Jamie Dimon's estimated net worth stands at USD1.7 billion, according to Forbes, while JPMorgan Chase's market capitalization is reported to be USD394 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.



Dimon recently made headlines by cautioning against relying on economic forecasts from central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, characterizing their projections as ""100 percent dead wrong."" Notably, the Federal Reserve is poised to make a decision on potential interest rate hikes in the coming week, after a pause in rate increases during September 2023.

The bank cites several factors contributing to this positive forecast, including resilient oil demand in the United States, robust growth in emerging markets, and a sense of stability in European markets. These factors collectively bolster the bank's confidence in the strength of the oil market in 2024.



However, the bank's longer-term projections highlight potential challenges for the oil industry. JPMorgan Chase forecasts a decline in the average price of Brent crude to USD75 per barrel in 2025. This dip is attributed to an anticipated surge in energy efficiency and an increasing shift towards electric vehicles at the expense of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. The rise in electric vehicle sales is expected to lead to a decline in overall demand for conventional fuel, impacting the dynamics of the oil market.



Examining demand trends, JPMorgan Chase anticipates growth of 1.9 million barrels per day this year, with a subsequent moderation to 1.6 million barrels per day in 2024. Despite ongoing economic challenges, the bank remains optimistic about demand, citing robust emerging markets, resilient demand in the United States, and stability in European markets as key supporting factors. These factors, according to the bank's analysts, will contribute to sustaining demand despite prevailing economic headwinds.



On the supply side, JPMorgan Chase expects a surge in production from sources outside the OPEC alliance. The bank emphasizes that if non-OPEC supplies witness robust growth, it could exert downward pressure on Brent prices, potentially pushing them below the USD70 per barrel mark. In response to these dynamics, the analysts at JPMorgan Chase anticipate that OPEC+ will likely maintain production levels to provide support for oil prices in the face of evolving market conditions. The bank's comprehensive analysis underscores the intricate interplay between demand, supply, and evolving market dynamics shaping the trajectory of global oil prices.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_OilEnergy_16_menafn.jpg,False,@menafn,13.737083,a8dcc124eb94504bee278987bc0b5c6d,0.0,0.0,0.9999716281890869,1.0,0.0,0.0

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

PETERSBURG, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–#Blac","(MENAFN- Caribbean News Global) Contribution to PCF's Diverse Ventures Fund Empowers Underrepresented Business Owners

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–#BlackEconomicMobility -Pinellas Community Foundation (PCF) has received $250,000 from JPMorgan Chase to support the'Diverse Ventures' program, which aids minority entrepreneurs and small business owners. The two-year commitment will build capacity and forge connections among grassroots business-support organizations serving minority entrepreneurs. Diverse Ventures builds upon work done by the Pinellas Community Foundation through its Social Opportunity Works Fund, supporting small businesses and minority businesses during the pandemic.





The program will borrow from national models of success in entrepreneurial support to help strengthen business-support organizations throughout Tampa Bay to serve minority and underserved business owners better. Diverse Ventures will partner with public, private and philanthropic organizations committed to equitable economic development and wealth-building in minority communities.

According to a report by the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, the median White family wealth is more than ten times that of the median Black family. Entrepreneurship and business ownership ─ particularly community-based businesses ─ can be an important factor in building wealth for business owners and the people they employ and closing the Black-White wealth gap.

Research and advocacy group One Community found that while 14% of businesses in St. Petersburg were Black-owned, they accounted for only 1% of business revenue. Further a study from the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that Black-owned businesses and Hispanic-owned businesses may be disproportionally affected during economic downturns.

'Most of the philanthropic capital awarded by JPMorgan Chase will be strategically invested to help nonprofit organizations that work with minority business owners build their capacity,' said Duggan Cooley, CEO of Pinellas Community Foundation.'We are very grateful for JPMorgan Chase's support in the form of capital as well as their small business expertise. Together, we aim to strengthen the regional ecosystem of small business support and make it more accessible for all.'

By building capacity where diverse-owned startups and small businesses are currently being served and creating new access points to under-utilized resources, this program will enhance and diversify the entrepreneurial ecosystem and help more Black and minority business owners access the training, resources, and capital they need to prosper.

'At JPMorgan Chase, we are constantly seeking innovative ways to address the disparities faced by minority entrepreneurs in the communities we serve,' said Maria Escorcia, Southeast Region Executive, Global Philanthropy for JPMorgan Chase.'We believe that supporting the Pinellas Community Foundation and programs such as Diverse Ventures is not just about providing monetary aid; it's about empowering communities, fostering innovation and creating a robust support network, to help this community thrive.'

The Diverse Ventures program will kick off by creating an inventory of regional business-support resources and a directory for entrepreneurs, which will highlight data about under and over-utilized resources, gaps in the network, and provide a roadmap for Diverse Ventures grantmaking.
