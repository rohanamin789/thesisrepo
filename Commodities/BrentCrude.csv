The goal of this study is to look into how changes in crude oil prices affect GDP per capita and exchange rate fluctuations.to investigate the influence of crude oil price shocks on GDP per capita and exchange rate movements. This research employed yearly time series data for the price of crude oil, exchange rate (USD/INR), and GDP per capita, from 1990 to 2020. Arithmetical tools such as Descriptive, Unit Root, Granger Causality Test, and OLS Model were applied. The present study discovered a strong bi-directional Granger causality effect of Dubai crude oil prices on exchange rates, as well as a bi-directional Granger influence of exchange rates on WTI crude oil prices. The diagnostic tests were successfully passed by the estimated models. According to the OLS model, the exchange rate was driven only by the price of Dubai crude oil, although the price of WTI crude oil influenced both the GDP per capita and the exchange rate over the research period. The key policy recommendation derived from this analysis is that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) must depreciate the rupee, first to restore much-needed exchange rate stability, then to stimulate domestic manufacturers, and finally, to attract foreign capital inflows.

Abstract
The present paper examine the effects of the steep surge in crude oil prices which is also regarded as oil price shocks on stock price returns and currency exchange rates of the G7 countries namely, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) in the context of Russia - Ukraine conflict in recent times. The steep surge in Brent crude oil price returns due to the outbreak of the war is taken as an exogenous shock to stock price returns and exchange rates for the period commencing from January 2, 2017, to June 29, 2022. The paper applies the Fractionally Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) model to capture the effect of crude oil price shock and Breakpoint unit root test to examine the structural breaks in the dataset. Structural breakpoints in the dataset for the entire stock price returns and exchange rates are observed during the period commencing from the last week of February, 2022 to the last week of March, 2022. Except for TSX, NASDAQ and USD, a noteworthy long memory effects running from Brent crude oil price to all the stock price returns along with the currency exchange rates for all G7 countries are also found.
Originality/value:
The present study investigates the effects of the Brent crude oil price shocks (due to steep increase in price) that have aroused due to the Russia – Ukraine conflict on stock price returns and currency exchange rates of G7 countries namely, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). The study employs the Fractionally Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) model which is considered to be a more flexible class of process for conditional variance and is capable to elucidate and represent the detected time-based dependencies of the financial market volatility in an improved approach rather than other GARCH class of models (Davidson, 2004). Moreover, the special characteristic of the long memory nature of FIGARCH models makes it superior to other conditional heteroscedastic models and thus branding it a loftier candidate for modeling volatility in stock market returns and exchange rates (Tayefi and Ramanathan, 2012).

Shares of state-run OMCs like Indian Oil (NS: IOC ), Bharat Petroleum (NS: BPCL ) and Hindustan Petroleum (NS: HPCL ) appreciated to the tune of 5%, a day after international crude oil prices used to their lowest levels recorded in more than a year. Brent crude and US WTI crude oil prices fell around 5% each to $73.7 per barrel and $67.6 per barrel respectively.

The fall in crude oil prices came amid concerns about the contagion in the world's financial system after the sudden collapse of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). According to analysts, turmoil in major financial companies may send the world economy into a recession, affecting global demand. This may have led to a fall in prices.

Falling prices of crude oil are beneficial for India as it imports a major chunk of its requirement. Oil prices quoted at their lowest level in more than a year.

Analysts expect that declining crude oil prices could help in the improvement of marketing margins of OMCs. ICICI Securities (NS: ICCI ) said that according to their estimates, OMCs have a marketing margin of around ₹ 3 per litre on diesel, ₹ 6/per litre on Petrol and ₹ 4/litre on a blended basis.

Meanwhile, analysts at Prabhudas Lilldher believe that OMCs are all well placed to benefit from improving marketing situation and healthy refining profitability.

Shares of BPCL gained 6.02% and closed at ₹ 350.20 apiece, HPCL closed 6.53% higher at ₹ 245.40 apiece and Indian oil climbed 1.91% and closed at 80.10 apiece on Thursday.",investing.com,1372,business,ES,en,Trade Brains,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/bfd90e287a6c916de16ad465fe4c3d0f_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,19.480265,ad0b70a0719433ab9c56ddd6a263c220
3,MCX Crude Oil Price Shows a V-Shaped Bounce,Kedia Advisory,2023-03-22 00:00:00,date,https://in.investing.com/news/mcx-crude-oil-price-shows-a-vshaped-bounce-3569789,investing.com,MCX Crude Oil Price Shows a V-Shaped Bounce,"MCX crude oil prices yesterday settled up by 5.71% at 5775 and managed to show a V-shape bounce amid improving risk sentiment thanks to the coordinated efforts by major central banks to rescue troubled U.S. and European banks. Yesterday's uptick in prices came after a historic deal in which UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, agreed to buy Credit Suisse (SIX: CSGN ) to save the bank. After an announcement of the agreement, major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, indicated that they would enhance market liquidity and support other banks.

Brent Crude prices continue to hold gains above $74.50 as yesterday Russia announced it would extend a unilateral 500,000 bpd production cut, first announced in February, through the end of June, potentially signalling a sustained production drop due to Western sanctions on its crude and oil products. While market participants are sceptical about whether Russia indeed reduced oil production last month, it cannot be ruled out that EU import bans and a G7 price cap have taken a bite out of the country's crude output. Moscow first announced a 500,000-bpd production cut on Feb. 10, after Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned there was a real risk the country would have to lower oil production this year due to the EU import bans and G7 price cap on its oil products. At the time, Novak said the cut would only last until the end of March. Today, Novak added that ""In accordance with the current market situation, the decision to voluntarily reduce production by the amount of 500,000 bpd will be valid until June 2023, inclusive.""

Officials with the G7, meanwhile, said the Group of Seven Nations was unlikely to revise a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil as planned. The officials said EU countries' ambassadors were told over the weekend by the European Commission there was no pressing desire among the group for an immediate review. OPEC+, which includes the world's top oil exporting countries and allies, including Russia, is set to meet on April 3. The group agreed in October to cut oil production targets by 2 million barrels per day until the end of 2023.

Today traders are likely to exercise more caution ahead of the release of the highly anticipated rate decision from the Federal Open Market Committee, which concludes its two-day policy meeting today. As of now, according to CME's Fed Watch Tool, 83.4% of investors expect the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates by 25 basis points to just above 4.75% after today's meeting. That compares to just 16.6% of investors who believe the central bank will pause rate increases. Also, the American Petroleum Institute reports US commercial inventories of crude oil unexpectedly rose by 3.3 million barrels last week, a source citing the data says, while gasoline supplies fell by 1.1 million barrels. The results, which were bearish for crude, were released ahead of official EIA inventory data due tonight. Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week of March 14, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Tuesday. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 58,593 contracts to 104,431 during the period.",investing.com,1372,finance,ES,en,Kedia Advisory,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/deff89968d87efafc388aa45b5d36a11_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,19.817736,baf1999b3b7e0f27028cc7b8bdf699d8

Crude oil
 has held the high ground after making a 2-month high on Monday following on from gains of over 9% last week.
The announcement over the weekend of OPEC+ cutting production by 1.1 million barrels per day saw the energy commodity reclaim levels that were lost in the collapse of SVB Financial last month.
Market perceptions around global 
growth
 prospects remain in flux with the Federal Reserve maintaining its hawkish mantra and China yet to ignite economic activity to pre-
pandemic
 levels.
In an interview with Bloomberg television overnight, St Louis Fed President James Bullard said that the higher oil price will make the Fed's job of lowering inflation more difficult.
Although he did say that he had expected the oil price to rise anyway, citing China re-opening and ‘Europe skiting recession'.
Yesterday's ISM manufacturing index came in below forecasts at 46.3 rather than 47.5 anticipated according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. It may hint toward a US economy that is starting to feel the impact of the Fed's tightening cycle.

Elsewhere, it has been reported that Chinese authorities warned top bankers there last Friday that the crackdown on corruption was far from over.
There had been increased hopes of a more flexible approach from the communist party toward business after the successful announcement of the split up of the Alibaba group last week.
Looking at the underlying structure of the WTI market, some of the indicators might be turning neutral. The OVZ 
volatility index
 has eased lower, potentially suggesting that the market could be comfortable with the current price.
The front two futures contract are neither in backwardation or contango, possibly saying that there is a degree of equilibrium between supply and demand.
Finally, the RBOB crack spread might have rolled over, having risen ahead of the rally in the oil price. The crack spread bifurcates the difference in price between WTI crude oil and refined RBOB gasoline.

We have introduced a model of multivariate adaptive regression that considers the quasi-periodic effects of pandemic waves in combination with the global effect of the economic shock to model the variation in the price of crude oil at international levels and to compare the induced effect of the pandemic restriction as well and the oil price variation on each country's CPI. The model was tested for the case of six emergent countries and developed European countries. The findings show that: (i) pandemic restrictions are driving a sharp rise in the CPI, and consequently inflation, in most European countries except Greece and Spain, and (ii) the emergent economies are more affected by the oil price and pandemic restriction than the developed ones.


 










 


The last two years were marked by a reversal of the general trend of gradual decline in consumer price inflation in Europe over the last four decades (1980–2020), which had overlapped with the undesirable effects of the SARS-CoV19 epidemic on the economy and society [
1
,
2
]. The rise of the Core Consumer Price Index, one of the essential indicators used to assess inflation, was accelerated by the increase in the demand for fossil fuels in the same period, which in turn led to a peak increase of more than five times of the Oil Price on the International Market, even though this tendency was necessarily consistent throughout the years, as some sharp drops and recoveries were reported, as evidenced in 
Figure 1
 [
3
].
The OPEC Reference Basket consists of a weighted average for the prices of oil and petroleum products produced by countries that are members of the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries). It can be considered an important tool for examining the market prices of petroleum. By adjusting production, OPEC aims to keep the prices of raw oil between a lower and an upper bound. The OPEC Basket includes a mix of lighter and heavier petroleum products. The prices of Brent crude oil and West Texas Intermediate crude oil are additional benchmarking instruments in the petroleum business [

].
At the beginning of the pandemic crisis, the oil-exporting states were facing a devaluation of their main natural resources [
8
,
9
]. Although these nations should be capable of enduring the crisis in the long run and reaping the advantages, they suffer as a result of its acute emergencies; short-term bankruptcy is threatened by dwindling demand and lowering prices. [
10
].
Our study was motivated by the observation that, early in the COVID-19 epidemic, the sharp temporary drop in headline inflation can be mostly attributed to shocks in oil prices; however, the oil price shocks started creating slower inflationary pressures at the beginning of 2021 and, by the end of 2021, the cumulative impact of these price shocks had largely increased, conducting at an increase of the broad-based price of the Core Price Index, durable goods (vehicles, consumer electronics, furniture), shelter (rent and owners' equivalent rent) and other services (such as insurance).
Two years ago, when COVID-19 started, economic activity and oil demand declined [
11
]. Oil producers modified production levels; however, this approach was insufficient to account for and alleviate market shocks. At the same time, it was in the interest of oil-producing countries and organizations not to endanger their own reservoirs or capital. Moreover, storage space was scarce. Further straining the economic system was the uncertainty about the severity and duration of the economic crisis [
12
].
As underlined by experts in oil and gas economics: 'No one really has a crystal ball—tomorrow, things can go in exactly the opposite direction. Change and volatility seem to be the only constant in the oil market. However, it is probably safe to say that there are three key underlying reasons' [
13
].
The notion of supply and demand is rather simple and adheres to standard economic principles. Price should rise as demand (or supply) rises or falls. Prices should decrease when supply grows or as demand declines.
In 2022, Kosakowski argued that 'the price of oil as we know it is set in the oil futures market. An oil futures contract is a binding agreement that gives one the right to purchase oil by the barrel at a predefined price on a predefined date in the future. Under a futures contract, both the buyer and the seller are obligated to fulfill their side of the transaction on the specified date' [
14
].
One of the consequences of the change in the crude oil price is reflected in the change in the price of gasoline at the pump, which means significant variation in the transportation costs of consumer goods and, implicitly, the change in the Consumer Price Index.
In time, different models of the influence of oil prices on inflation were proposed. The considered methods cover a wide spectrum of approaches, starting with relatively simple ones, which are based on estimated linear equations with common factors (estimated based on the static principal component method [
15
]), and continuing with MIDAS models [
16
], in which polynomial functions are used to limit the number of parameters to be estimated. The models with dynamic factors that use the Kalman filter (MF-DFM) for their evaluation and extension in line with the projection horizon are also included, as well as more complex methods that use Bayesian estimation techniques, applied in a context where they are present multiple unobservable variables—Bayesian VAR models that use mixed-frequency data sets [
17
].
If there was a significant reduction in the costs of passenger transport at the beginning of the pandemic (first half of 2020), due to severe traffic restrictions, during the next three waves of the epidemic, the gradual increase in online commerce led to the explosive development of retail distribution networks, which induced an accelerated increase in the price of fuels and also in the average price of consumer goods [
15
].
An early study of the pandemic influence on the Consumer Price Index was posted by the International Monetary Fund in November 2020 [
16
], followed by an analysis of inflation in the UK after the first year of the micro-economic pandemic [
17
].
The effect of the pandemic on the fuel price in Turkey was first studied by Kartal [
18
], who used a regression model based on spline functions to demonstrate the close correlation between oil price fluctuations and global volatility.
Later, it was shown that a structural VAR (Vector Auto-Regression) model is a more natural framework to estimate the effect of gasoline price shocks on inflation and inflation expectations than reduced-form correlations [
19
]. Another quasi-linear model using the New Keynesian Phillips curve was proposed in order to simulate the shock of COVID-19 on the Consumer Price Index [
20
].
In 2021 a nonlinear model of the e-Market rise under pandemic conditions was proposed, combining a logistic growth model with a seasonal attenuated quasi-cyclic effect of COVID-19 restrictions [
21
].
Starting from this model, we propose a non-linear regression model of the behavior of Crude Oil Price (OCP) during the pandemic restrictions between March 2020 and February 2022. The new regression equation for oil price variation contains two main components: a cyclic one that models the variation of OCP produced directly by the economic and social restrictions associated with each pandemic wave, and a logistic component that models the cumulative economic effect over the entire pandemic period.
In this paper, we also analyze the variation of Consumer Price Index (CPI), as the main component of the Inflation index, in various European countries, in order to propose a new non-linear regression model relying on the dependence of CPI on the pandemic restrictions in selected European countries, from one part, and the variation of Crude Oil Price (OCP) between March 2020 and February 2022, for the other part.
For the original data for the Consumer Price Index, we used the Core Consumer Price Index data from the Word Bank Database, an indicator that does not include the volatile Food and Energy price index (Word Bank: A Cross-Country Database of Inflation, 
https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/30657/InflationChartsAll.zip
, accessed on 7 December 2022). We chose six European countries: Germany and Slovenia from the Central Europe zone, Romania and Lithuania from East Europe and, separately, Greece and Spain as Mediterranean countries, to proceed to the comparative analysis of their Price Index variation. The geographical distribution of the studied countries is evidenced in 
Figure 2
.
The evolution of the CPI for these countries in the last two years is represented in 
Figure 3
, where the horizontal axis counts the number of months starting with 1 January 2020.
As evidenced by previous works, the epidemiological status of the pandemic was marked by periods of sharp increases in the total number of active infections, followed by gradual declines [
22
]. This behavior will be referred to as pandemic waves.
From the analysis of the graphs, it is easy to see, in the case of the Western European countries (Spain, Germany, Slovenia), a staggered overlap of the increase in consumer prices with the four pandemic waves, defined for the periods: March–June 2020 (corresponding to months 3–5 from the graphs), October–December 2020 (months 10–12), March–May 2021 (months 15–17), and September–November 2021 (months 21–22). In the case of Romania and Lithuania, the increase in prices is much more uniform, with a significant gap between May and October 2021. In the case of Greece, there is a small decrease in consumer prices superimposed over the four waves of COVID-19 restrictions. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was also shown in other articles, and our findings are consistent with previous results [
23
,
24
,
25
].
The original data for the OPEC crude Oil basket Price variation were retrieved from the Statista site [
26
], as shown in 
Figure 4
. The first pandemic wave coincides with a strong reduction in oil demand, reflected by the significant decrease in the price of the oil barrel, followed by an accelerated increase in oil consumption and its price during the period of relaxation of traffic restrictions.
The other three waves of the epidemic induce a slight temporary drop in oil prices, followed by an accelerated rise in barrel prices. The fastest growth occurred between November 2020 and May 2021, and between December 2021 and February 2022.
The first step of our investigation was to identify a possible pattern of oil price fluctuations during the pandemic period. Following the above observations, we proposed and tested two statistical hypotheses:
Hypothesis
 
1.
 
The global effect of a pandemic crisis is positively related to a general growth of oil prices
.
Hypothesis
 
2.
 
The effect of a pandemic waves restriction can be related to temporary decreasing oil prices
.
For the first hypothesis, inspired by a previous work on financial crisis prediction [
27
], we proposed a regression equation that contains a logistic term of growth, the usual term used to simulate the forced growth of an indicator in conditions of shock or economic crisis:
where OCP is the Crude Oil Price, and T is the time expressed in months. The term 
Res
 means the standard residual error of the regression model.
The second hypothesis requires the introduction of a new periodical term justified by the seasonal effect of the COVID epidemic (accentuated in spring and fall). The model is derived from the quasi-periodical behavior of the e-Market during the COVID-19 pandemic, proposed in [
24
]:
The coefficients were estimated by the least square method, using Stat and NLS nonlinear package in R code:
(1)
(2)

(7)
The Fisher test of the relevance of the model resulted in a F

 = 2.6987 for 6, 17 degrees of freedom respectively. Therefore, the model passed the Fisher test of significance. The coefficients

(
c
6) = −2.106, respectively (both greater to t
critical
 = 1.739, for 17 degrees of freedom with significance level a = 0.05). In consequence, both the logistic terms grown and seasonal one can be considered relevant. In 
Figure 5
, we represented the regression function for the period March 2020–October 2022; the model predicted a maximum Crude Oil Price of around 101.5 dollars in July–August 2022.
Notable is the fact that the model does not take into consideration the eventual political decision of OPEC to raise or reduce oil production [
28
,
29
], nor of Russia's political influence on oil prices or, alternatively, the demand-side alteration of countries in the EU towards Russian petroleum [
30
,
31
], which can be seen in the last months of the data simple The negative value of the 
c
5 coefficient corresponds to a reduction in the rate of increase of the oil price.

The high volatility of commodity prices and various problems that the energy sector has to deal with in the era of COVID-19 have significantly increased the risk of oil price changes. These changes are of the main concern of companies for which oil is the main input in the production process, and therefore oil price determines the production costs. The main goal of this paper is to discover decision rules for a buyer of American WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil call options. The presented research uses factors characterizing the option price, such as implied volatility and option sensitivity factors (delta, gamma, vega, and theta, known as 'Greeks'). The performed analysis covers the years 2008–2022 and options with an exercise period up to three months. The decision rules are discovered using association analysis and are evaluated in terms of the three investment efficiency indicators: total payoff, average payoff, and return on investment. The results show the existence of certain ranges of the analyzed parameters for which the mentioned efficiency indicators reached particularly high values. The relationships discovered and recorded in the form of decision rules can be effectively used or adapted by practitioners to support their decisions in oil price risk management.


 










 


Prices of energy resources are highly volatile, mainly due to events that cause disruptions in the supply chain and affect lead times, delivery times, and production costs. In addition, many unpredictable situations can disturb the demand for raw materials. This was clearly visible in 2020 when governments of many countries decided to freeze retail trade and other economic activities to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, various limitations and the resulting slowdown in production during the first COVID-19 wave (and the first lockdown) significantly reduced the demand for crude oil and that which follows reduced its price [
1
]. The COVID-19 pandemic also caused the crude oil market to become ineffective, and it was difficult to predict the crude oil prices [
2
]. Moreover, the commodity markets, including the crude oil market, are strongly interconnected with other financial markets [
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
]; therefore, they have a significant impact on the condition of the whole world economy [
7
,
8
]. There is also an observed transmission of volatility from the oil market to the stock market, which has become more prominent with the COVID-19 pandemic [
9
].
One of the instruments that was created to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices is derivatives. There are financial instruments that derive their values based on the underlying assets. Furthermore, derivatives make it to possible to settle future deliveries at a price determined at the moment of concluding the contract. Thanks to this form of settlement, each counterparty entering into the contract knows exactly how much it will pay or what amount it will receive for future supplies of raw material, and is therefore able to plan future expenses. The very idea of derivatives was born in the 17th century, while the first stock exchange derivatives (futures contracts) were introduced to trading in the mid-19th century on the CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) exchange. Currently, commodity derivatives play a very important role in global trading.
One of the main types of exchange-traded derivatives are options. An option is defined as a 'contract between two parties, a buyer (holder, long position) and a seller (writer, short position), in which the buyer has a right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a certain amount of the underlying asset (stock, bond, interest rate, commodity or other assets) at the denoted strike price within a specific time period' [
10
]. Sellers willing to accept the risk of unlimited loss as a result of fluctuations in the price of the underlying asset can write options, collecting the premium and taking advantage when options expire worthless. The premium collected by a seller is seen as a liability until the option either is offset (by buying it back) or expires [
11
].
Due to the specific structure (asymmetric risk), options offer opportunities for price risk management, including the risk of changes in energy commodity prices. The effective use of options in price risk management depends on parameters such as the strike price, the level of implied volatility, or the expiry date of the option. All of these parameters have a significant impact on the final result achieved by the buyer or option writer; however, only some of them (e.g., strike price) are set by those who open their positions in options, while the others (e.g., the level of implied volatility) are only observable. In this paper, we use association analysis to discover decision rules to adjust the price risk management parameters. We decided to use decision rules because they can be easily understood by business practitioners who do not always have much IT or statistical knowledge. The research focuses on WTI Crude Oil call options, i.e., call options written on the WTI crude oil and listed on the NYMEX exchange. The data used in the performed analyses cover a period of over 14 years (2008–2022) and concern the ATM (At-The-Money) option with the execution period from 1 to 90 days. The decision rules are discovered based on the levels of implied volatility, number of days to expiration, and the values of four option sensitivity coefficients (the Greeks): delta (


Δ


), gamma (


Γ


), vega (


𝒱


), and theta (


Θ


). The rules are optimized in terms of indicators related to the total return on long positions in call options and the costs incurred by the option buyer (total option premiums paid), i.e., we focus solely on the option buyer, for whom the maximum loss on the option market is limited and known on the day of opening the position. The decision to include only long positions is due to the fact that the rules are intended to hedge against the rise of oil prices and not to speculate on the commodity options market.
The approach proposed in this paper fills the research gap regarding the possibility of using commodity options in hedging against the risk of oil price fluctuations. There are only a few works that compare the effectiveness of these financial tools. Several articles [

Look no further than

. WTI is down roughly 7 percent this week so far, marking the worst 5-day period since the middle of March. The commodity has almost filled the upside gap ever since OPEC+ announced surprise cuts amid fading global growth prospects at the end of last month. That caused a surge in WTI as markets started trading after the last weekend of March.
Oil is a key export of Canada, making the economy at times sensitive to swings in its price. Lately, fears of a global growth slowdown have been driving the commodity lower. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve's beige book showed that policymakers noted that economic activity stalled in recent weeks. Meanwhile, there is a distinct contrast between how China's economy is being driven by domestic versus external factors.
Earlier this week, Chinese retail sales strongly beat expectations as the economy continued to recover from the zero-

 regime. But, industrial production fell behind, which is more sensitive to the health of the global economy. As such, it is not too surprising to see USD/CAD climb higher in recent days, tracking the decline in oil 
prices

Canadian Dollar Technical Analysis
Focusing on the daily chart, USD/CAD is now facing the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The pair has not tested it since the end of March. This line could maintain the near-term downward focus, pivoting prices back to the rising trendline from November and the 1.3263 – 1.3334 support zone. Otherwise, confirming a breakout above exposes the 1.37 inflection zone.

: Global crude oil prices have been falling gradually over the past few months and the trend seems no signs of reversing anytime soon. Oil prices continued their downward trend on Monday due to a range of global factors that have clouded its demand outlook.

It may be noted that central banks around the globe are expected to raise interest rates in May in a bid to tackle high inflation. This could further impact demand for crude oil among major oil-importing nations.
Moreover, China's edgy economic recovery after the Covid-19 has also clouded oil demand outlook, even as Chinese customers' data showed on Friday that the world's top crude importer brought in record volumes in March. China's imports from top suppliers Russia and Saudi Arabia were more than 2 million barrels per day each.
John Driscoll, director of JTD Energy Services, told news agency Reuters that the recent correction in oil prices is due to mixed economic data and continued central bank intervention.
Meanwhile, analysts and traders remained bullish about China's fuel demand recovery towards the second half of 2023 and as additional supply cuts planned by OPEC+ from May could tighten markets.
Analysts at the National Australia Bank expect China's oil demand recovery to more than offset the slowdown in OECD demand in the near term, while sanctions and supply constraints add upside risks to prices. They said that Brent could rise to $92 per barrel by the end of the second quarter.

This study aims to examine the short-term and long-term relationship between WTI oil prices and renewable energy production considering U.S. crude oil production, world oil prices, and other domestic and global factors. We employ several time-series analysis techniques, including the augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Phillips-Perron test for unit roots; the long-term relationship is examined using fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and Park's canonical cointegration regression (CCR). We also utilise an error correction model (ECM) to distinguish between short- and long-term effects. It is shown that at a constant level of crude oil production, an increase in energy production from renewable sources is accompanied by an increase in oil prices. Thus, at this stage of development, despite the increased production, renewable energy can be considered as complement to but not a substitute for crude oil. Our empirical estimations allow us to conclude that renewable energy production today is pushing the price of oil up rather than lowering it.

According to the Statistical Review of World Energy 2022 [
1
], crude oil production in the United States has steadily increased since 2017, reaching 711.1 million tonnes (Mt) in 2021. As a result, the United States is now one of the world's top crude oil producers. The Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia are the world's next largest crude oil producers, with 536.4 Mt and 515 Mt, respectively. In terms of crude oil exports, Saudi Arabia dominated the market in 2021, exporting 323.2 Mt, followed by the Russian Federation with 263.6 Mt, Canada with 197.4 Mt, Iraq with 176.1 Mt, the United Arab Emirates with 146.1 Mt, and the United States with 138.5 Mt, which ranked sixth. The United States has changed its crude oil import and export structure due to the implementation of restrictions on heavy crude oil imports from Venezuela. As a result, the country now exports light oil and imports heavy oil [
2
].
Despite its domestic production, the United States still relies heavily on crude oil imports to fuel its economy, and this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Based on the B.P. Statistical Review of World Energy 2022 [
1
], the United States heavily relied on Canada, South and Central America, and Mexico for its heavy crude oil imports in 2021, from which it imported 187.1 Mt, 29.2 Mt, and 29.0 Mt, respectively. On the other hand, most of the U.S.'s light crude oil imports in 2021 came from Saudi Arabia, amounting to 17.7 Mt. In terms of lighter crude oil imports, the United States had significant trade movements in 2021 with Europe, Canada, South and Central America, India, China, and other Asia Pacific countries, with 51.4 Mt, 15.5 Mt, 8.3 Mt, 20.5 Mt, 11.5 Mt, and 25.1 Mt, respectively. These statistics illustrate the importance of international trade in meeting the United States' energy demands, with a diverse range of countries supplying crude oil to the nation.
As of 2021, the United States has secured its position as the global front-runner in natural gas production, producing a staggering 934.2 billion cubic meters (Bcm) of this valuable resource. Russia closely trails behind in second place, with a production output of 701.7 Bcm. Iran ranks third with 256.7 Bcm, followed by China in fourth place with 209.2 Bcm. Regarding natural gas exports, the United States shipped out 179.3 Bcm in 2021, while Russia exported 241.3 Bcm. It is noteworthy that these statistics highlight the United States' dominance in the global natural gas market, as they produce the most while still managing to export a significant portion of their resources to other countries [
1
].
Given that the United States is the largest producer of crude oil globally and holds considerable sway over energy prices, our model's selection of the WTI price as the dependent variable was appropriate. To this end, our model must incorporate data on the production and consumption of crude oil in the United States.
The prices of WTI crude oil in the United States significantly impact the global economy and financial markets. Therefore, investigating and modelling the prices of WTI crude oil is a crucial direction for economic and financial analysis. WTI crude oil plays a vital role in the U.S. economy and international trade, meaning that even slight changes in oil prices can considerably impact the global economy. The cost of WTI crude oil directly affects the prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other oil products, which, in turn, influences the expenses of consumers and businesses. Furthermore, fluctuations in WTI crude oil prices can also affect inflation, currency exchange rates, and even political stability in regions that rely on the oil industry. Thus, analysing WTI crude oil prices can help businesses and investors make more informed decisions in their operations, and it can assist governments in developing more effective political and economic strategies amidst the uncertainty in the oil market.
The OPEC oil price is a critical factor influencing the global oil market. This price is determined by the balance of supply and demand for oil, which in turn depends on various factors such as economic growth, political instability, changes in production, and technological innovations. The OPEC oil price also affects the price of WTI oil, as they are closely linked to each other. However, it should not be forgotten that the markup for WTI oil also depends on other factors, such as crude oil types such as Brent and Dubai Crude. This effect is attributed to the high cost of crude oil extraction using the U.S. Hydraulic fracturing technology. As global crude oil prices increase, hydraulic fracturing becomes more lucrative. The Drilling Productivity Report [
3
] notes that an increase in the number of active wells in the U.S. leads to increased oil production. However, drilling new wells generally costs more than fracturing existing ones and enhancing their productivity. The U.S. fracking boom [
4
] has resulted in a surge in crude oil production and increased global supply, driving down world oil prices. The reduction in world oil prices triggers the closure of unprofitable wells and a decrease in oil production in the U.S., which directly impacts the WTI price formation and can be incorporated into the model.
However, it also highlights the significance of renewable energy sources as a potential solution to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. With the rise of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, the demand for crude oil may decrease, thus leading to a reduction in hydraulic fracturing and crude oil production. Moreover, as renewable energy technologies continue to advance and become more affordable, they could become more competitive with traditional energy sources. This could result in a shift towards renewable energy sources and a decrease in the use of fossil fuels, which would not only reduce the impact on the environment but also provide long-term economic benefits. Therefore, the insights gained from understanding the dynamics of crude oil production can inform the transition towards a more sustainable energy future.
Based on the report on renewable power generation costs by the International Renewable Energy Agency [
5
], it has been observed that there has been a significant decline in the global weighted-average total installed cost of onshore wind farms, offshore wind farms, and solar photovoltaic installations over the past decade. Specifically, the total installed cost of onshore wind farms has decreased from USD 2044/kW in 2010 to USD 1325/kW in 2021, indicating a decline of 1.54 times. Similarly, the total installed cost of offshore wind farms has reduced from USD 4876/kW in 2010 to USD 2858/kW in 2021, showing a decline of 1.71 times. Moreover, solar photovoltaic installations have experienced the most significant decline in total installed costs, with the cost decreasing from USD 4808/kW in 2010 to USD 857/kW in 2021, indicating a decline of 5.61 times. These cost reductions signify the growing affordability and accessibility of renewable energy sources, which could pave the way for a cleaner and more sustainable energy future for the world (
Figure 1
).
Solar power has come a long way since its inception in space exploration, and its adoption has grown in recent years. Despite initial costs and challenges associated with using solar panels on Earth, advancements in technology and mass production have made solar power more accessible and affordable. Solar panels can now harness energy even in cloudy or low-light conditions, making them a viable option for renewable energy. Additionally, solar power is eco-friendly and can reduce our carbon footprint, making it a prime example of sustainable energy that can play a pivotal role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. As we strive towards a cleaner and more sustainable future, solar power has immense potential to become a reliable and uninterrupted renewable energy source.
Solar photovoltaic (P.V.) technology's production costs have significantly declined over the past few decades. According to studies conducted between 1976 and 2019, the cost of generating electricity through solar panels has reduced considerably from 
$
106 to 
$
0.38 per 1 watt generated. This decrease in the cost of 278 times is a significant milestone in the solar energy industry. This cost reduction is attributed to various factors such as technological advancements, economies of scale, and increased investment in research and development. As the solar energy sector continues to grow, it is expected that the cost of producing electricity generated by solar P.V. technology will continue to decrease further, making it a more affordable and accessible source of energy for consumers worldwide [
5
]. This is seen on a logarithmic scale; the solar photovoltaic and onshore wind data are almost linearised in 
Figure 2
. In their work, Lafon et al. (2017) showed that for solar photovoltaic cell/module systems, the rate of cost reduction as the electricity they produced doubled was 20.2% (
Figure 2
) [
6
].
In 2020–2021, renewable energy production through solar photovoltaic and onshore wind sources reached a significant milestone by breaking through the bottom of prices. As a result, they have become more affordable energy sources than new projects based on fossil fuels. The pricing of these renewable sources has remained competitive, even amidst rising oil and gas prices, especially in the year 2022. This has significantly increased the competitive advantages of solar P.V. and onshore wind technology, making them even more desirable energy sources for commercial and residential use.
Numerous factors contribute to the forecasting of oil prices. These factors can be categorised into various areas, such as politics, economics, the environment, and sanctions restrictions. All these factors must be considered to ensure compliance with the supply-demand balance. It is important to note that the equilibrium oil prices can vary considerably depending on the specific scenario being considered. As such, it is crucial to consider all the factors that could influence the price of oil when attempting to forecast future prices. By doing so, we can better understand the future of this critical commodity.
Consider four possible scenarios out of a vast array of potential outcomes. The International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios [
8
] have predicted the following oil prices by 2050, namely STEPS (Stated Policies Scenario), APS (Announced Pledges Scenario), and NZE (Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario), which forecast the oil prices to be 95 USD per barrel, 60 USD per barrel, and 24 USD per barrel, respectively, by the year 2050 (based on 2021 prices). Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy  Administration (EIA) has predicted the highest oil price by 2050 through its High Oil Price scenario, which corresponds to 175 USD per barrel (based on 2020 prices) [
9
]. On the other hand, forecasting energy prices in the European Union is even more daunting because of the significant fluctuations observed in the historical period due to the considerable supply shortage in the market.
The available long-term forecast options for the maximum and minimum oil prices up to the year 2050 exhibit significant variations. However, it is essential to note that these predictions do not necessarily dictate the exact trajectory of the long-term price of oil. We understand that the specified range allows for price spikes to occur within certain conditions and at specific times. Hence, while these forecasts provide valuable insight into potential future trends, they are subject to numerous factors that may cause fluctuations in oil prices. As such, it is essential to remain vigilant and adaptable to unexpected changes.
This investigation aims to analyse the connection between WTI oil prices and U.S. crude oil production, both in the short term and long term. To achieve this goal, we consider various factors, such as global oil prices, national natural gas prices, and renewable energy output. We apply numerous time series analysis methods, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Phillips-Perron test for unit roots, and the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and Park's canonical cointegration regression (CCR) to examine the long-term relationship. This article contributes to the crude oil literature in a number of important ways. First, the cointegration approach used in this article directly shows a cointegrating relationship between WTI prices, U.S. crude oil production, OPEC oil prices, and renewable energy production.

Crude oil has dual attributes of finance and energy. Its price fluctuation significantly impacts global economic development and financial market stability. Therefore, it is necessary to predict crude oil futures prices. In this paper, a hybrid forecast model of EEMD-CNN-ILSTM for crude oil futures price is proposed, which is based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Improved Long Short-Term Memory (ILSTM). ILSTM improves the output gate of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and adds important hidden state information based on the original output. In addition, ILSTM adds the learning of cell state at the previous time in the forget gate and input gate, which makes the model learn more fully from historical data. EEMD decomposes time series data into a residual sequence and multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Then, the IMF components are reconstructed into three sub-sequences of high-frequency, middle-frequency, and low-frequency, which are convenient for CNN to extract the input data's features effectively. The forecast accuracy of ILSTM is improved efficiently by learning historical data. This paper uses the daily crude oil futures data of the Shanghai Energy Exchange in China as the experimental data set. The EEMD-CNN-ILSTM is compared with seven prediction models: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), LSTM, ILSTM, CNN-LSTM, CNN-ILSTM, and EEMD-CNN-LSTM. The results of the experiment show the model is more effective and accurate.

Crude oil performs an essential role in human survival and development. It is a vital strategic resource and one of the most important energy sources [
1
]. Since China entered the 21st century, rapid industry development requires more crude oil and energy security has become increasingly important [
2
]. Therefore, if the crude oil price changes significantly, it will impact the economic development and financial market of China and even the whole world in a short time [
3
,
4
].
The development of machine learning has provided possibilities for predicting nonlinear and medium to long-term time series data, thus compensating for the limitations of traditional econometric models. A traditional fully connected neural network has many parameters and quickly loses time series information. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has realized the extraction of information from the time dimension and has the memory ability of early data. In recent years, this model has achieved significant breakthroughs in speech recognition [
5
], text recognition [
6
], machine translation [
7
], and time series data analysis [
8
]. Still, RNN has apparent shortcomings, namely, 'gradient vanishing' and 'gradient explosion'. When the time series data's length is longer, the independent variable of the activation function is smaller or larger, and the weight adjustment effect is lost in the process of product transmission of the chain rule. LSTM improves the shortcomings of RNN by gated mechanism.
The ILSTM put forward in this paper adds the calculation of the cell state at the previous time in the input gate and forget gate of LSTM to ensure the complete learning of the historical state. In addition, the output gate of LSTM is improved, and crucial hidden state information is added based on the original output to enhance the output result. Therefore, ILSTM can further improve prediction precision. This paper puts forward a hybrid forecast model of EEMD-CNN-ILSTM for crude oil futures prices. Compared with simple models, EEMD-CNN-ILSTM exhibits a more complex structure and integrates multiple components, resulting in higher prediction accuracy. It employs EEMD for preprocessing the closing price of crude oil futures historical data, extracts spatial or frequency-domain features using CNN, and uses ILSTM for sequence modeling and prediction. This model can also be applied to other time series forecasting tasks. EEMD is an enhanced version of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), which solves the mode aliasing problem using noise-assisted data. EMD can also be combined with CNN-ILSTM, but EEMD offers several advantages over EMD in terms of signal decomposition. EEMD demonstrates better robustness, higher quality in extracting mode functions, improved frequency characteristics, and the ability to control noise interference. Therefore, we choose to integrate EEMD with CNN-ILSTM instead of EMD. EEMD decomposes the initial data into a residual sequence and several IMF components, each having the same characteristic time scale. In this paper, the IMF components are integrated according to low-frequency, medium-frequency, and high-frequency, aiming to reduce the model's complexity and overall training time. CNN is responsible for further mining features in different component data and covers the shortage of ILSTM in feature extraction. Based on the closing price data of crude oil futures, this paper analyzes the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). It takes the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closing price, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and the US Dollar Index (USDX) as the influencing factors. By introducing seven different comparison models, R Squared (






R


2






), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the forecast results as a whole [
9
]. The MAE, RMSE, and 






R


2






 of EEMD-CNN-ILSTM are 8.397, 11.504, and 0.9886, respectively. By comparison, the EEMD-CNN-ILSTM model is more accurate and effective. In summary, this paper's contributions are as follows:
(1)
This paper applies the signal decomposition method to time series prediction. The IMF components are integrated into low-frequency, medium-frequency, and high-frequency according to the Zero-Crossing Rate (
ZCR
). Thus, the number of components input into the model is fixed, which ensures the high availability of the model and solves the problem of long training time for too many input components.
(2)
By studying the structure and principle of RNN and LSTM models, this paper proposes ILSTM. ILSTM adds the calculation of the cell state at the previous time to the forget gate and input gate of LSTM and improves the output gate by adding important hidden state information on the basis of the original output so that the model can learn more fully from historical data.
(3)
This paper proposes a hybrid model of crude oil futures price prediction based on EEMD-CNN-ILSTM. The introduction of EEMD helps CNN to extract the features of different frequency signals better. Through comparative experiments, it is verified that the hybrid model based on EEMD-CNN-ILSTM for crude oil futures price prediction has the highest prediction accuracy and is superior to the other seven prediction models.
EMD and EEMD are practical tools for analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary signal sequence data. For instance, Yu et al. forecasted crude oil prices using an EMD-based neural network [
10
]. Chen et al. used EMD decomposition to forecast China containerized freight index [
11
]. Shu et al. combined EMD decomposition with CNN and LSTM to forecast stock prices [
12
]. Wu et al. predicted crude oil prices by EEMD and LSTM hybrid model [
13
]. Tang et al. used EEMD combined with a randomized algorithm to predict oil and natural gas prices [
14
]. Through reading relevant papers, it is found that the decomposition and integration method is usually adopted in the application of EEMD, and its feasibility in time series data prediction is also confirmed [
15
]. However, in practice, when a new day's data is inputted, the number of IMF components decomposed by EEMD may change, meaning the model needs to be retrained. In this paper, IMF components are combined into three categories of low-frequency, medium-frequency, and high-frequency according to the 
ZCR
 for training, thus improving the model's usability and reducing its training time.
In recent decades, many domestic and foreign researchers used traditional statistical and econometric methods to predict crude oil prices. For example, the autoregressive integrated moving average model [
16
], generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [
17
], vector autoregressive [
18
], random walk [
19
], and error correction model [
20
] were used to forecast crude oil price. However, traditional statistical methods cannot thoroughly study the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of time series data, and the forecast accuracy is relatively poor.
The artificial neural network can learn complex nonlinear data, which solves the shortcomings of traditional statistical methods in forecasting time series data [
21
]. RNN can remember previous data, so it can be used for time series forecasting. However, the RNN cannot learn the long-term dependencies in the data, and the problems of 'gradient disappearance' and 'gradient explosion' will occur [
22
].
LSTM effectively overcomes the shortcomings of RNN and adopts gated technology to learn long-term dependencies in the data. For instance, Manowska et al. used LSTM to forecast crude oil consumption [
23
], and Liu et al. used LSTM to predict and analyze renewable energy supply risk [
24
]. Due to the prediction model being single, extracting the data feature is often insufficient, and it is challenging to achieve a high-precision forecast. Yang et al. used EEMD, LSTM, linear regression, and Bayesian ridge regression methods to prove the superiority of decomposing the original data into multiple sub-sequence values by EEMD, then using LSTM to predict each subsequence value, respectively, for final integration [
25
]. CNN can be used in predicting time series data. Sun et al. proposed a CNN-LSTM soybean yield prediction model, which confirmed that the hybrid model combined with CNN was better than a single LSTM model [
26
]. Zhang et al. used the CNN-LSTM hybrid model to predict air quality [
27
]. Kim and Sun, and Zhang et al. used the feature extraction of CNN to further improve the prediction accuracy.
In 1998, Huang and Shen et al. proposed the EMD method, which can be used to decompose time series data [
28
]. EMD decomposes a set of time series data into several IMF components, each representing the change frequency and trend of the original data on different scales. However, EMD has the disadvantage of mode aliasing. The so-called mode aliasing means that there are signals with different frequencies or scales in an IMF component, or signals with the same frequency or scale are decomposed into different IMF components. Due to the above problems, in 2009, Wu and Huang et al. [
29
] put forward EEMD using the noise-assisted data analysis method. EEMD can decompose the initial time series data into one residual sequence (Res) and n IMF components. Noise amplitude and ensemble numbers in EEMD decomposition are crucial parameters that affect modal decomposition. According to the previous research results [
30
,
31
] and crude oil futures data characteristics, the noise amplitude is set to 0.04, and ensemble numbers are set to 100. Finally, we use the daily closing price data of crude oil futures from 26 March 2018 to 18 November 2022, in the Shanghai Energy Exchange of China as the experimental data set. 
Figure 1
 shows the decomposition of the closing price into one residual sequence and eight IMF components.
As the data decomposed by EEMD is historical, considering the input of future data, the number of decomposition results may change, which means that the model trained after decomposing historical data may need help to deal with the input data in the future. At the same time, considering that the more components, the more time it will take. Therefore, this paper calculates the 
ZCR
 [
32
] of each component by where 
x
(
n
) is the 
n
-th data value, 
N
 is the total length of a frame of data, and 
sgn
 () is formulated as:
ZCR
 represents the ratio of sign change in each component data, which can approximately reflect the fluctuation frequency of data. As shown in 
Table 1
, the 
ZCR
 of IMF1 is higher than 40% as a high-frequency component, the 
ZCR
 of IMF2 is between 10% and 40% as medium-frequency component, and the 
ZCR
 of IMF3~IMF8 is less than 10% as low-frequency components [
33
]. Xu et al. utilized the EMD-CNN-LSTM composite model to predict short-term power load by categorizing the IMF components and residual sequence into three categories: high-frequency, medium-frequency, and low-frequency [
33
]. On the other hand, Li. employed the EEMD-ARIMA-LSTM combination model to forecast crude oil futures prices by categorizing the IMF components into high-frequency and low-frequency, then adding a residual sequence, resulting in a total of three categories [
34
]. Experimental results, as shown in 
Table 2
, demonstrate that the EEMD-CNN-ILSTM model performs best when utilizing the four components of low-frequency, medium-frequency, high-frequency, and a residual sequence. Therefore, the number of the prediction model's input data components is reduced from nine to a fixed number of four. Only four components of low-frequency, medium-frequency, high-frequency, and residual sequence need to be trained, and the training time is greatly reduced, as shown in 
Figure 2
.
CNN has a good feature extraction function. Three-dimensional convolution can extract temporal and spatial features at the same time, which can be used for behavior recognition and video processing. Two-dimensional convolution can be used to extract local features of pictures, which can be used in the field of image processing. One-dimensional convolution has only one convolution direction, which can be used in a sequence model. In this model, CNN can extract the frequency features of low-frequency, medium-frequency, high-frequency, and residual sequence, then input them into ILSTM. Its convolution operation

 is formulated as:

b


 is the bias vector,

 is the input feature,

 is the weight of a one-dimensional convolution kernel, 


f

LSTM has advantages in analyzing long-term dependencies of time series data because it adopts the ideas of gate and cell state and avoids the long-term dependencies of RNN. There are three gates in LSTM: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate.

Gasoline and crude oil price movements have been the focus of many studies in the last decade. We use the asymmetric error correction model (ERM) to examine the hypothesis of asymmetric pricing for both regular and premium gasoline markets at the US national level and in the four states with the highest gasoline consumption. Using weekly crude oil and retail gasoline prices from June 2000 to February 2023, the results show an asymmetric response in the gasoline market for all four states and at the national level. However, the adjustment speed tends to differ for the types of gasoline and across states. The implications of these results for policy and welfare are discussed in this study.

Crude oil price is categorized as one of the highest volatilities in recent decades. Since 1980, the inflation-adjusted price of crude oil has experienced two historical peaks in 2008 and 2011. Moreover, the Russia–Ukraine war caused the most recent price peak in 2022. Therefore, due to this high volatility in recent years, research in the oil market has gained new interest among economists (
Le et al. 2023
). On the other hand, crude oil is considered the main component of gasoline, and the price of gasoline is expected to follow the crude oil price. However, there has been an argument about the price-setting behavior of oil companies. The argument claims that retailers adjust the price of gasoline more quickly to cost increase or when the crude oil prices go up than to cost decrease or when the crude oil prices go down. In economics, the phenomenon whereby prices adjust differently depending on their direction is considered price asymmetry. The price asymmetry could imply important welfare and policy implications.
The existence of price asymmetry in the transmission mechanism between input prices and output is typical in many financial markets and agricultural products and is not exclusive to the energy market. This begs the question: do output prices follow changes in input prices symmetrically, or do they depend on the public's opinion? This price variation reminds us of the common belief in 'the rockets and feathers' hypothesis that (
Bacon 1991
) introduces, reflecting the idea that retail gasoline prices rise like rockets for positive oil prices and drop like feathers for negative oil price shocks.
Researchers conducted various empirical studies to examine the connection between crude oil and gasoline prices, looking to see if there was an asymmetric pass-through. The primary focus of this pattern is on whether gasoline prices respond asymmetrically to positive and negative shock costs. However, the studies differ in the data frequency, model specification, and sample and time period. In an influential paper, (
Borenstein et al. 1997
) (hereafter BCG) study the US gasoline market using weekly data for 1986–1992. They apply a vector autoregression model to test the asymmetric adjustment behavior, and the result confirms that gasoline prices adjust faster when oil price increases than when oil price decreases. Johnson (
2002
) studies the gasoline and diesel market in the United States. He finds that the retail prices in the diesel market display more asymmetric responses than those in the gasoline market. (
Honarvar 2009
), (
Atil et al. 2014
), (
Bremmer and Kesselring 2016
), and (
Bagnai and Ospina 2018
) are similar studies with a focus on asymmetric price transmission in the energy market.
Investigations into the phenomenon of asymmetric pricing between gasoline and oil are not exclusive to the United States. (
Bettendorf et al. 2003
) analyzed the retail price adjustment in the Dutch gasoline market, (
Contín-Pilart et al. 2009
) in the Spain market, (
Boroumand et al. 2016
) in the French market, (
Chou and Tseng 2016
) for Taiwan, and (
Chen and Sun 2021
) in China. However, some other studies find no evidence of asymmetric price behavior due to a different model or data sources, for example, (
Godby et al. 2000
), (
Galeotti et al. 2003
), (
Bachmeier and Griffin 2003
). Finally, recent research conducted with large datasets of daily or weekly data has been exploring the relationship between dynamic pricing and Edgeworth cycles, such as (
Eckert and West 2004
), (
Lewis and Noel 2011
), (
Zimmerman et al. 2013
), and (
Noel 2019
). Again, the focus of these studies is independent of the rockets and feathers hypothesis.
This paper aims to determine whether an asymmetric price transmission exists between crude oil and gasoline prices in four US states and nationally from June 2000 to February 2023. We contrast this study with previous ones by focusing on state-level and weekly data instead of aggregate and monthly data. We examine both regular and premium gasoline markets to see if the price asymmetry differs between them and across states. To this end, we use an error correction model (ECM) to analyze the short-term and long-term interactions between crude oil and gasoline prices. We assume that gasoline prices will eventually reflect crude oil costs; however, we acknowledge that this may not be the case in the short run. Two main conclusions emerge from our results. First, the findings show an asymmetric price transmission in both regular and premium gasoline markets at both national and state levels. Second, the analysis reveals that the speed of adjustment tends to differ for the types of gasoline and across states.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

The common econometric specification of studying dynamic price adjustment is to use an error correction model. The retail gasoline price response to changes in the wholesale price is modeled via a lag adjustment model with an error correction term that imposes a long-run relationship between crude oil prices and retail prices. The error correction model (

 Two binary (dummy) variables are added to account for the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are interested in the following null hypothesis:
Rejection of the first null hypothesis implies asymmetric price transmission in the short run, and rejection of the second null hypothesis confirms the asymmetric price transmission in the long run.
This paper estimates the model presented in Equation (
3
) under four data setups. First, we estimate the price transmission between regular gasoline and WTI crude oil prices for the entire United States (national level) and then estimate the model separately for each state. Second, we conduct the same estimation to find the nature of the price transmission between premium gasoline and WTI crude oil price at the national level and in each state.
This paper studies the relationship between the price of regular and premium gasoline and the crude oil price in four US states
4
 and at the national level. The dataset consists of weekly data on the wholesale and retail price of regular and premium gasoline nationally and for California, Florida, New York, and Texas between June 2000 and February 2023. All prices are before taxes. There are two benchmark measures of crude oil prices. One is the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a grade of crude oil that is both low in density and low in sulfur. The second important price for crude oil is Brent. However, the price of WTI is a more common benchmark than Brent in the United States. This study's crude oil data consist of the weekly average WTI sweet crude oil price at Cushing, Oklahoma. All prices are obtained from the US Energy  Administration. Moreover, we include binary variables to account for the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. There are 1187 observations for the US and state levels. 
Table 1
 reports descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analysis.
To better understand the price differences in different parts of the country, retail gasoline prices are analyzed nationally and in the four states with the highest gasoline consumption
5
, including California, Florida, New York, and Texas. Most studies utilize aggregate-level data, but, by examining prices at state level, a more detailed analysis can be completed. 
Figure 1
 and 
Figure 2
 display the weekly average price of regular and premium gasoline in the four states mentioned. The figures highlight the difference between the prices of gasoline across these states. For instance, the average price for regular gasoline across the four states varies from a low price of USD 2.4/gallon in Texas to a high price of USD 3.09/gallon in California. The common factors to explain the variation in gasoline prices across states could be taxes and the environmental requirement to use a higher-quality fuel to limit pollution. The data variation is also different across states. Florida and Texas have smaller standard deviations than the national average, and California and New York have larger variations.
At the national level, according to the Energy  Administration (EIA), the United States is the largest oil consumer, accounting for more than 20% of the world's total consumption. On the other hand, gasoline consumption in the United States accounts for more than 45% of national petroleum consumption, with 97% of all gasoline used by light-duty vehicles (cars, sport utility vehicles, and light pick-up trucks). Crude oil is considered the main component of gasoline; therefore, it is unsurprising that the retail gasoline price follows a similar pattern to that of crude oil. The rest of what consumers pay at the pump depends on federal taxes, refinery, and distribution costs, which usually remain stable. Therefore, we expect gasoline prices to reflect the crude oil price fluctuations, as can be seen in 
Figure 3
. The prices for crude oil are then passed on to consumers through the gasoline market, which is available at over 145,000 retail fuel outlets across the United States.
A causal relationship between two variables implies that changes in one variable can forecast the changes in the other variable. We perform the Granger causality test (
Granger 1969
) to eliminate the concerns of simultaneity bias and the endogeneity problem between crude oil prices and regular and premium gasoline prices. 
Table 2
 shows the results of the Granger causality test. The null hypothesis that crude oil prices do not affect gasoline prices is rejected for both the regular and premium gasoline at the 1% level. However, the null hypothesis that gasoline prices do not affect crude oil prices cannot be rejected. The results confirm that crude oil prices affect US regular and premium gasoline prices. However, the relationship does not go the other way.
Table 3
 summarizes the estimation result of Equation (
3
) for regular gasoline. The Wald test is applied to test for the asymmetric pattern in the short term and long term. The asymmetric long-run effect of crude oil prices on gasoline prices can be indicated by the error correction term. The null hypothesis is

 at the national level and in almost all states, implying that stretched margins (corresponding to crude oil price decrease) are corrected differently as squeezed margins (corresponding to crude oil price increase). For instance, at the national level, the long-run speed of adjustment coefficient for the price increase or when the gasoline price is below the equilibrium price is −0.076. However, the long-run speed of adjustment coefficient for the price decrease or when the gasoline price is above the equilibrium price is −0.051.

China's growth prospects remain mired but hopes for stimulus persist Libya is set to add to oil production. Will that cap WTI?

Crude oil prices continued to retreat from the 3-month peak seen last week on a soft economic outlook for China and easing political tensions in Libya, potentially lifting production capacity.

The WTI front futures contract touched US$ 77.33 bbl last Thursday before tumbling into the weekend and continuing lower to start this week, trading below US$ 74 bbl.

The Brent futures contract saw similar price action, nudging US$ 81.75 before visiting US$ 78.25 bbl on Monday.

China's GDP figures on Monday revealed that the economy grew at 6.3% year-on-year in the second quarter against forecasts of 7.3% and 4.5% in the previous quarter.

The data comes at a time when the world's second-largest economy is facing headwinds to reignite its economy. There has been wide speculation that Beijing may take several more measures to stimulate activity, but the steps so far have been tentative.

If China's economy continues to languish, it may undermine demand for energy.

Two large oil fields in Libya that had halted production due to protests have reopened. It is being reported that the fields of Sharara and El Feel will add around 320k barrels per day (bpd) to global supply.

This addition may go some way to counter the 500k bpd production cuts recently announced by Russia.

Potentially lending some support to black gold is the RBOB crack spread that has ticked up again this week. The RBOB crack spread is the gauge of gasoline prices relative to crude oil prices and reflects the profit margin of refiners.

RBOB stands for reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending. It is a tradable grade of gasoline. If profitability increases for refiners, it may lead to more demand for the crude product.

The price action saw WTI crude fall back into the broad range of US$ 66.80 – US$ 77.33 that it has been in for 11 weeks.

The OVX index measures volatility in the WTI oil price in a similar way that the vix index gauges volatility on the s&p 500 . The OVX continues to drift lower, perhaps reiterating the range trade-type environment that currently pervades and potentially might continue.

If you wish to listen to this commentary, please click

The Fed should signal in its FOMC statement on Wednesday that it is effectively done raising key interest rates as inflation cools and Treasury bond yields settle down. There's a great article in Bloomberg today scoring all the voting members of the Fed from hawks to centrist to doves.

According to Bloomberg, there are

a lot more doves and centrists than hawks. So there is a growing chance that we will not have a rate hike tomorrow. And

even if we do have a rate hike tomorrow, it should be the last, and we're all expecting a

very upbeat and

positive FOMC statement.

Brent crude oil crossed above its 200-day moving average this week. China's rising demand this year, plus its recent pledge to stimulate its economy remains the primary force behind crude oil's recent rise.

Additionally, big fires on Pemex offshore oil platform and refinery are raising concern that Mexico's crude oil production is sputtering due to neglect.

There is plenty of crude oil to be extracted in Mexico if they contact U.S. oil service companies. Exxon Mobil also curtailed production at one of its refineries, so the inventory of refined products remains tight.

energy stocks are benefitting from rising global demand for fossil fuels from emerging markets, as well as strong seasonal demand in the U.S. Furthermore, the chaos in Russia makes them an unreliable source of crude oil, despite the fact that Russia is currently producing more crude oil now than Saudi Arabia after its 2 million per barrel per day cut.

Western sanctions and harsh winter weather is anticipated to continue to curtail Russia's crude oil production long-term.

Energy stocks have also been aided by the tension in the Middle East as Iran continues to hijack ships. As a result, the U.S. Navy dispatched two amphibious warships and thousands of Marines to the Middle East to counter Iranian threats. China imported 11.4 million barrels per day of crude oil in the first six months this year, which is 11.7% higher than a year ago.

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? click here to find out .

Interestingly, 2.13 million barrels per day of crude oil came from Russia and China has boosted its stockpile of crude oil to take advantage of cheaper Russian crude oil. So overall, due to China stockpiling crude oil and the tension in key crude oil shipping lanes, like the Straight of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, crude oil prices may continue to meander steadily higher.

Energy prices are expected to remain firm, simply because there are too many global uncertainties. In the U.S., we are fortunate to be food and energy independent.

However, many workers are upset that their wages are not keeping pace with inflation like UPS workers.

Furthermore, the UAW is worried about losing their jobs due to the transition to EVs as GM and Ford move of their EV production to Mexico, so they are not endorsing President Biden's re-election yet.

Speaking of EVs, GM announced that its second-quarter results were hindered by a $792 million extraordinary charge related to the recall of its Bolt EV to replace its LG battery packs.

Excluding this extraordinary charge, GM posted strong sales and operating earnings.

The average vehicle that GM sells now trades at around $52,000, up 3% for the first quarter, so GM is moving increasingly upscale with its vehicles. Due to GM's strong operating earnings, I suspect the UAW will play hardball and go on strike if its demands are not met.

We are now in the midst of the second quarter earnings announcement season.

Already many of our stocks are exhibiting relative strength, which is a sign that money is gravitating to those companies that will post the strongest quarterly results and guidance.

We are in the midst of a'rolling recovery' as our favorite economist, Ed Yardeni, likes to say.

There are essentially four improving industry sectors where we can find stocks, namely (1) semiconductors/cloud computing, (2) oil refining/integrated energy, (3) consumer discretionary, and (4) homebuilding.

The damage to the seven largest capitalization stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) appeared to happen last Friday

since most of these stocks opened stronger this week.

The other 93 stocks in the QQQ index were the beneficiaries of the reduction in weight of the seven largest capitalization stocks.

The bottom line is the breadth and power of the overall stock market continue

to improve as investor confidence and economic growth persists.

The earnings of all the energy majors have declined as oil prices retreat from a peak of $122 U.S. a barrel achieved in June 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brent crude oil, the international standard, is currently trading at $83 U.S. a barrel.

Exxon Mobil said its Q2 net income, or profit, amounted to $7.88 billion U.S., or $1.94 U.S. per share, compared to a record $17.85 billion U.S. profit reported a year earlier.

Revenue was also lower in the quarter, falling 27% from a year earlier to $80.80 billion U.S.

However, apart from last year's record second quarter, Exxon Mobil posted its strongest earnings for the April through June period in more than a decade, aided by cost cuts.

The company said it has achieved structural cost savings of $8.3 billion U.S. from 2019 levels, nearing its $9 billion U.S. cost-cutting target.

Exxon Mobil's oil production currently stands at 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), in line with the company's annual target. The U.S. Permian Basin delivered 622,000 boed in Q2.

The company distributed $8 billion U.S. in cash to shareholders in Q2, including $3.7 billion U.S. of dividend payments.

Crude oil price forecasting is an important research area in the international bulk commodity market. However, as risk factors diversify, price movements exhibit more complex nonlinear behavior. Hence, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of forecasting Brent crude oil prices by comparing various hybrid combinations of linear and nonlinear time series models. To this end, first, the logarithmic transformation is used to stabilize the variance of the crude oil prices time series; second, the original time series of log crude oil prices is decomposed into two new subseries, such as a long-run trend series and a stochastic series, using the Hodrick–Prescott filter; and third, two linear and two nonlinear time series models are considered to forecast the decomposed subseries. Finally, the forecast results for each subseries are combined to obtain the final day-ahead forecast result. The proposed modeling framework is applied to daily Brent spot prices from 1 January 2013 to 27 December 2022. Six different accuracy metrics, pictorial analysis, and a statistical test are performed to verify the proposed methodology's performance. The experimental results (accuracy measures, pictorial analysis, and statistical test) show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid forecasting methodology. Additionally, our forecasting results are comparatively better than the benchmark models. Finally, we believe that the proposed forecasting method can be used for other complex financial time data to obtain highly efficient and accurate forecasts.


 










 


The price of commodities in the international market varies significantly and rises over time. The fluctuation in commodity prices has a significant impact on the world economy, increasing import costs, promoting inflation, stifling economic growth, and reducing the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy [
1
]. Therefore, the global economy must analyze the features of variations in commodities sold on foreign markets to forecast their price and their historical patterns.
As one of the most important energy resources and one of the most widely traded commodities, crude oil is crucial to the global economic system. It is well known for having significant price changes that directly affect the world economy. Crude oil, an essential component of industrial production, has a significant impact on the growth and stabilization of the world economy and the international financial markets. Crude oil price changes have a severe impact on the development and safety of nations worldwide by limiting their growth and destabilizing the global economy [
2
]. Oil importers may experience inflation and other economic effects as oil prices rise, whereas oil exporters may experience an economic slump and political unrest as oil prices decrease [
3
].
Due to the above-stated factors, researchers have paid a lot of attention to the energy crisis and the volatile petroleum price [
4
,
5
]. Crude oil is a commodity with significant worldwide influence because it is the key source of primary energy. However, predicting the price of oil is a difficult task since many factors (global economic conditions, speculative expectations, extreme events, political instabilities, and technological trends) influence oil pricing, and the strengths of these factors change over time [
6
,
7
]. Because of the above-mentioned factors, forecasting day-ahead crude oil prices is one of the most important and challenging tasks and attracts the attention of researchers.
According to the literature, the price of crude oil has been predicted using different types of forecasting techniques. These predictive models can be broadly classified into three main categories: (a) statistical and econometric models; (b) machine learning algorithms; and (c) hybrid models. Statistical and econometric models used for crude oil forecasting include random walk, autoregressive, autoregressive integrated moving average, autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity, vector autoregressive, vector error correction models, etc. [
8
,
9
]. For instance, Xiong and Wu [
10
] employed the vector error correction (VEC) model and cointegration analysis to forecast the demand for crude oil in China. Gülen [
11
] also forecasts the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price by using the cointegration methodology. Lanza et al. [
12
] used the error correction model (ECM) specification to predict crude oil prices. Drachal [
13
] used the vector autoregression model (VAR) and found that these models are more accurate than single equation models for forecasting. Ahmad [
14
] used Box–Jenkins approaches to examine Oman's average monthly crude oil prices and recommended the seasonal model ARIMA

. Morana [
15
] forecasted the oil prices for short-term horizons by using the semiparametric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. Mohammadi and Su [
16
] evaluated the predictions of several ARIMA-GARCH models on the weekly prices of crude oil in eleven global markets. Hou and Suardi [
17
] used a nonparametric GARCH model, which indicates that this approach provides an appealing and practical substitute for the widely used parametric GARCH models. Joshi [
18
] used a linear regression model to forecast oil prices. One of the main assumptions of econometric and statistical models is linearity, and they provide good results when the price series are linear or close to linear. These models might not be the best choice, because there is a lot of nonlinearity and inconsistency in the observed crude oil price series [
19
].
On the other hand, the price forecasting literature has developed and used several machine learning models, including support vector machines, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, in response to the shortcomings of statistical and econometric methodologies. For example, a neural network model was developed by Movagharnejad et al. [
20
] to analyze the price changes in different commercial oils in the Persian Gulf region. Mirmirani and Li [
21
] used vector autoregression and artificial neural networks to investigate US oil prices and suggested that in forecasting, a BPN-GA model can perform better than a VAR model. Through the use of the hierarchical conceptual (HC) and artificial neural networks-quantitative (NNA-Q) models, machine learning and computational intelligence techniques are used to forecast the monthly WTI crude oil price for each barrel in US dollars. The outcome of the simulation analysis verified the efficiency of the HC model's data selection method [
22
]. Xie et al. [
23
] suggested a new SVM-based technique to forecast the price of crude oil. They compared SVM's performance with that of ARIMA and BPNN to assess its potential for forecasting. Several studies have shown that when it comes to price prediction, AI models frequently outperform traditional time series models [
19
,
24
,
25
]. Moreover, AI models can have flaws and limitations of their own. For instance, the choice of parameters affects NNAs [
19
]. Other proposals fir time series analysis and forecasting can be found in [
26
,
27
,
28
,
29
] and references therein.
The complexity of oil pricing is due to relevant time series frequently including lag, nonlinearity, and connections to several markets. It has been difficult in the literature to suggest a hybrid model that can both capture and optimize these aspects. Abdollahi, H., and Ebrahimi, S. B. [
30
] proposed a hybrid model to forecast daily Brent crude oil prices with the lowest possible forecasting error and, more importantly, to introduce a hybridization that is best able to capture the key characteristics of the oil price time series, including nonlinearity, lag, and market interactions.
In recent studies, Chen, Z. et al. [
31
] used the MIDAS modeling framework, which is a common mixed data sampling approach, to investigate how leverage and jumps affect the ability to forecast the realized volatility (RV) of China's crude oil futures. This study's findings can be utilized to better predict the volatility of China's crude oil futures, reduce investment risks, and provide higher profits. Salisu, A. A., et al. [
32
] found that the GARCH-MIDAS-X model for oil volatility forecast accuracy is improved by considering any inherent asymmetries in the global economic activity proxies. The findings that led to these conclusions are valid across a range of forecast periods and alternative energy sources. The Musetescu, R.C., et al. [
33
] approach involves forecasting conditional variance over two distinct periods, 20 May 1987 to 24 January 2022 and 20 January 2020 to 24 January 2022. In comparison to the model GARCH-M (1,1), which is appropriate for the period 2020–2022, the forecasting results showed that GARCH (1,1) was the model with the highest level of crude oil volatility anticipated for the entire time. Xing, L. M. and Zhang, Y. J. [
34
] studied various shrinkage mechanism specifications to forecast the crude oil price and evaluated the prediction effectiveness from both a statistical and an economic standpoint. By considering the nonlinear forms of predictors, Zhang, Y., et al.'s [
35
] study aimed to enhance the forecasting capabilities of diffusion index (DI) models. To be more precise, they used principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS), two popular DI models, to forecast monthly crude oil returns.
In today's modern world, day-ahead forecasting is beneficial for operational planning, enabling companies to efficiently change production schedules, improve logistics, and allocate resources. On the other hand, short-term forecasting facilitates risk management by allowing traders to measure market volatility and control portfolio risk. In addition, accurate and efficient day-ahead forecasts help energy traders to make wise judgments concerning purchases and sales of energy commodities. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of forecasting Brent crude oil prices by comparing various hybrid combinations of linear and nonlinear time series models. To this end, first, the logarithmic transformation is used to stabilize the variance of the crude oil prices time series; second, the original time series of log crude oil prices is decomposed into two new subseries, a long-run trend series, and a stochastic series, using the Hodrick–Prescott filter; and third, two linear and two nonlinear time series models are considered to forecast the decomposed subseries. Finally, the forecast results for each subseries are combined to obtain the final day-ahead forecast. The proposed modeling framework is applied to daily Brent spot prices from 1 January 2013 to 27 December 2022.
The remainder of the paper is designed as follows: 
Section 2
 comprises the general procedure of the proposed hybrid forecasting approach. 
Section 3
 contains an empirical application of the proposed forecasting methodology using the daily Brent oil price data. 
Section 4
 details the discussion of the proposed best combination model versus the considered standard linear and nonlinear time series benchmark models. Finally, 
Section 5
 covers the conclusions, limitations, and future research directions.
This section explains the proposed hybrid forecasting methodology for daily Brent oil spot prices forecasting. The Brent spot price time series exhibits nonlinear and complex characteristics. To achieve this, the original time series of Brent spot prices (

) is decomposed into two subseries, the long-term nonlinear trend (

) and a stochastic (residual) (

) series, using the Hodrick–Prescott filter. The mathematical representation of the decomposed components is given by the Hodrick–Prescott Filter is described in the following subsection.
A smoothed-curve representation of a time series that is more complex to long-term variations than to short-term fluctuations is obtained by using the Hodrick–Prescott filter (HPF). The adjustment of the sensitivity of the trend to short-term fluctuations is achieved by modifying a multiplier

 illustrates the performance of the HP filter by presenting a graphical representation of the new subseries decomposition. The figure consists of three panels, showcasing the original time series of Brent oil prices, the nonlinear long-run trend denoted as

end-demand worries continue to overshadow a more bullish supply picture the technical charts may point to further short-term losses

crude oil prices struggled again on wednesday in europe, extending consistent falls seen since mid-august. the energy market remains glumly concerned about demand in both china and the united states, albeit for widely divergent reasons.

china clearly represents the greater difficulty as evidence mounts that its post-covid recovery has faded out already. moreover, beijing's monetary response to this month's raft of weak data has so far underwhelmed global markets. investors want to see the voltage turned right up as soon as possible, to stop incipient deflation from digging in, but the people's bank of china merely trimmed short-term loan rates last week. 'a start, but not nearly enough,' seems to have been the markets' verdict.

by contrast the us economy is performing rather well, overall, but this very performance has investors concerned that above-target inflation will need either more interest rate rises, or demand-sapping higher rates for longer, if it's going to be tamed. naturally, those higher rates would put the brakes on economic activity and, thereby, energy prices.

these worries about the world's number one and two national economies overshadow what might without them be seen as quite price-positive news for energy. cuts from major producers have been extended into september, and global oil demand was revealed by the international energy agency to have reached another all-time high in this year's second quarter.

still, for now, demand concerns dominate, and they're unlikely to lift anytime soon. this week's market highlights will include weekly oil inventory numbers from the us energy information administration and thursday's look at durable goods orders. the kansas city's federal reserve's jackson hole symposium of central bankers will also be in focus, as it has in the past been the venue for major speeches by the world's monetary heavyweights.

us crude oil technical analysis

us crude prices daily chart compiled using tradingview

the west texas intermediate crude benchmark daily chart shows prices still in a broad band between the low of december 9 at $70.30 and the peak of april 12 at $83.50. the market is inclined to trade back into that band very rapidly whenever it leaves it, a phenomenon seen on fewer than seven occasions.

it's possible that this tendency has gone unchallenged for longer than it might thanks to a long, northern-hemisphere summer trading lull, but it's a notable feature of the market even so, with the timing and direction of a conclusive break a likely long-term directional cue.

there's no immediate sign of that, however, but a near-term 'head and shoulders' pattern seems to be forming quite clearly, bringing a challenge for oil bulls should it be confirmed. this pattern suggests that the market may be topping out, with the focus likely on mid-july's lows in the $73/barrel area should it head below recent lows.

any gains above the current 'right shoulder' top of $82.02 would put august 9's high of $84.51 back in the bulls' sights.

immediate fibonacci retracement support of the rise from june 28 to the peak of august 10 comes in very close to the current market price at $78.07.

The crude oil price eased to start Monday after posting its first weekly loss since mid-June last week.

us dollar strength across the board has been a feature of recent broader market price action and the commodity space has not been spared the calamity.

The WTI futures contract is under US$ 87 bbl while the Brent contract is approaching US$ 84.50 bbl.

The Fed appears to be open to another potential hike in its target rate but perhaps more importantly, the back end of the Treasury curve has seen a notable bump up in yields.

The benchmark 10-year bond traded at 4.328% last Thursday but eased slightly into the weekend. That peak was just a fraction below the 4.335% seen in October last year, which was the highest return on that note since 2007.

At the same time, the DXY (usd ) index traded at its highest level since early June.

The surge in Treasury yields could be related to the deterioration in the Chinese Yuan. The recent data on Treasury holdings revealed that China were again sellers of the bonds through June.

They have sold every month this year, except for March, a month that saw the Yuan rally significantly. China holds over US$ 800 million of US Government debt.

With the Yuan tumbling last week and the capital price of Treasury bonds falling to lift yields, official selling from China could be a feature of the market as they seek to have US Dollars at the ready to be able to buy Yuan.

The outlook for China's economy has been undermined by several defaults by large property players and more recently, a notable trust company missed its obligations last week.

The world's second-largest economy is facing scrutiny on its ability to reignite growth , and this may have helped to hinder prospects there.

A Bloomberg survey of economists is anticipating the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to ease monetary policy later today by 15 basis points for the 1- and 5-year loan prime rate.

This lack of confidence in economic activity saw energy traders question the recent run-up in crude oil prices .

Inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and US Energy Information Agency (EIA) will be closely watched this week for clues on the tightness of the crude market.

Both measures have seen notable declines of late but with the price slipping, a build-up of stockpiles might be possible.

The WTI futures contract broke below the lower bound of an ascending trend channel last week and then found support near a prior low and the 260-day simple moving average (sma) .

Those levels might continue to provide support near 78.70 and 79.00.

Further down, support could be at the breakpoint of 77.33 and the prior low at 73.82. Between those levels, the 55- and 100-day SMAs may provide support in the 75.30 – 75.50 area.

On the topside, resistance might be at the breakpoints near 83.40 ahead of the recent peak at 84.89.

S&P 500
 in 2023. Oil and gas prices have stabilized following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices have risen about 90% in the past three years. Stocks that are highly correlated to oil prices are generating tremendous free cash flows. However, high correlation to crude can be a double-edged sword, as many energy investors experienced when crude prices collapsed in early 2020.

In his podcast addressing the markets today, Louis Navellier offered the following commentary.

ShowArtificially High YieldsCrude: Higher for LongerInvest in Hot SpotsCoffee Beans: Grazing on Weed Artificially High Yields

The financial markets seem convinced that there will be a federal government shutdown. The truth of the matter is these budget battles are a big game of chicken, so if the deficit ceiling is not lifted, a 30-day continuing resolution is the most likely scenario.

Even if there is a federal government shutdown, the interest payments on Treasury debt and Social Security payments are expected to continue since it would be political suicide to miss those payments. I anticipate that Treasury bond yields will finally moderate when the deficit ceiling is lifted, but in the meantime, the budget battles are contributing to artificially high Treasury yields.

Interestingly, if Congress does not pass a stopgap funding measure this weekend, such as a 30-day continuing resolution, essential workers like TSA, air traffic control and customs would stay on the job. However, the Commerce Department and Labor Department funding would dry up, so economic data would cease to be released. This would obviously interfere with the economic data that the Fed is monitoring.

In the past, similar partial federal government shutdowns have suspended funding for the federal courts, the FTC, the SEC and other federal agencies. Typically, these federal workers are reinstated within two weeks, with full backpay, so again the deficit ceiling is largely just political theater.

Crude: Higher for Longer

Multiple energy stocks are now reasserting their market leadership after gasoline prices in August rose 10.5% in the CPI and a whopping 20% in the PPI. This is due to an acute inventory decline. Furthermore, there is a diesel shortage again, especially in Europe, so the U.S. is exporting more distillates (i.e., diesel, heating oil, jet fuel, etc.), which is causing the trade deficit to decline and boost GDP growth. Naturally, since gasoline prices are high, Joe Biden's popularity is plunging in the polls. Saudi Arabia is controlling crude oil prices and appears to be striving to defeat President Biden.

Specifically, candidate Joe Biden said that he found'very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia' and promised that, as President, he would make the Saudi government an international'pariah.' Furthermore, if that was not insulting enough, candidate Biden then went on to insult the entire Saudi Royal Family.

So I think it is obvious that Saudi Arabia is keeping crude oil prices high to help defeat Joe Biden in the 2024 Presidential race. With $4 gasoline prices ($6 per gallon in California) and soon the be 4% unemployment from an 11-month manufacturing recession, it should not be surprising that Joe Biden is almost 10% behind candidate Donald Trump in a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.

Due to food and energy inflation, consumers are not happy. The war against fossil fuels is failing, especially against natural gas, since in America, we are blessed to have the cheapest natural gas in the world. More pipeline projects are now reemerging as natural gas prices meander higher.

This is a good time to remind you that natural gas prices are very sensitive to the weather and ideally like hot miserable summers (for peaker power plants) and very cold winters (for heating). Last November, natural gas prices plunged 50%, due to a disruption at a big LNG port as well as unusually warm weather in the Northeast. This winter is forecasted to be much colder for both Europe and North America due to an El Nino weather pattern, which bodes well for higher natural gas prices.

Presidential election years are typically good for the stock market since the leading candidates promise everything and anything, which helps to boost consumer confidence. Joe Biden's reelection pitch is supposed to be launched in Super Bowl ads, while candidate Donald Trump clearly wants to restore lower gasoline prices, shore up the U.S. southern border, and end the war in Ukraine.

Powerful foreign influence from Saudi Arabia is expected to influence the 2024 Presidential election since they are effectively controlling gasoline prices. Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, wants to settle the Ukraine war on'the battlefield' due to waning support for Ukraine among NATO nations.

Russia is also being increasingly isolated and Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, recently said'No matter what they say, they (the United States) control this (Ukraine) war' and added,'They supply weapons, ammunition, intelligence data, data from satellites, they are waging a war against us.'

All the money going to Ukraine has become a contentious issue, especially after Poland abruptly ceased all military aid to rebuild the Polish military readiness. I should add that Poland has been leading a ban on Ukrainian wheat to protect its farmers, so tensions between the two countries remain high. However, Poland may be increasingly worried that Russia will invade if Ukrainian defenses fail.

All this international chaos is expected to keep crude oil prices high. Furthermore, Joe Biden is going to have to defend spending billions to fund the war in Ukraine, while disaster relief in Maui and East Palestine, Ohio, is widely believed to be lacking. Since some Ukrainian generals have bought villas in Spain and are driving fancy sports cars, there is also a big concern that there are some serious leaks with the aid to Ukraine.

Invest in Hot Spots

Amidst this chaos, plus ongoing labor unrest in the U.S. with the UAW being the biggest of several strikes this year, American consumers remain grumpy, but continue to spend up a storm as their credit card bills grow to record levels. However, due to a strong U.S. dollar, the price of imported goods should continue to decline as falling EV prices have demonstrated, because the U.S. has been importing deflation from China.

As a result of a lot of chaos and distractions, our best defense remains a strong offense of fundamentally superior stocks. In addition to all the refinery and energy stocks, I am also recommending (1) the best AI stocks, (2) the drug companies profiting from the booming demand for weight loss medication, (3) the strong demand for cruising/travel demand, (4) a potato shortage, and (5) resurging semiconductor demand. In other words, stay invested in the best economic hot spots with improving sales and exploding earnings.

The earnings environment is poised to steadily improve in the next four quarters. There is no doubt that a strong U.S. dollar may hinder the earnings of some big multi-international companies since approximately half of the S&P 500's revenue is outside of America. The growth stocks I am recommending are not expected to be inversely impacted by a strong U.S. dollar. Furthermore, due to positive analyst earnings revisions in recent months, I am expecting another round of big earnings surprises! In other words, we remain'locked and loaded' for another earnings announcement season.

New Delhi, Oct 4 (KNN) India's Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday urged oil producers' cartel OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) to'imbue a sense of pragmatism, balance and affordability in the oil markets'.

He highlighted the rise in crude oil prices due to production cuts by major oil producers and its expressed concerns over its adverse impact on major oil consuming nations.







According to an official statement, he held talks with OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al-Ghais in Abu Dhabi and called for'balancing global energy markets by ensuring that crude oil prices do not outstrip the paying ability of the consuming countries'.

India is the world's third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85% of its requirement.

He has also been cautioning that unreasonably high oil prices could jeopardise the post-pandemic recovery and lead to an economic slowdown in various parts of the world, which could in turn hit global oil demand.

'During the discussions, the minister highlighted that due to the production cuts carried out by OPEC and OPEC+ countries from August 2022 onwards, effectively around 5% of the total global oil availability has been removed from the market, causing crude oil price to rise around 34% in just (the) last 3 months. These cuts have been made despite growing energy demand. Brent Crude oil prices jumped from around $72/bbl in June to around $97/bbl in September 2023, placing severe strains on the capacities of most oil importing consuming countries,' the petroleum ministry said in the statement.

'Minister wondered whether the global economy is again going to witness a situation similar to the economic turmoil of 2008 which had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Brent prices had initially soared from $93.60/bbl in January 2008 to $ 134.3/bbl in July 2008, fueling an accelerated global economic meltdown, leading eventually to demand destruction and very low oil prices,' it added.

But suddenly there is a new war on and we have a new crisis to grapple with. The flashpoint is the Gaza Strip for now, but the fighting may spread. Even as the Israelis and Palestinians come to terms with the horrific death toll, the reverberations on the world economy can be felt loud and clear. Crude oil prices surged sharply on Monday as fighting intensified in and around Gaza. Brent crude rose 3.44 percent to $87.49 a barrel, while US West Texas intermediate crude rallied 3.85 percent to $85.98. The upward trajectory for oil, which had eased by $5-6 a barrel in recent days, is likely to continue as there is perception of a shortage looming.
 
Iran, a major oil producer, had been pumping more oil after the US began easing sanctions on Tehran. However, Iran's public backing of the Hamas attacks may push the US to turn the screws once again, resulting in a supply cut. A bigger fear is that if Iran is drawn into the conflict it could disrupt seaborne oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz; about 37 percent of seaborne oil passes through the narrow waterway off Iran's southern border. For India, which imports 85 percent of its needs, crude oil prices rising to $100 or beyond will have serious implications. Inflation has just about been brought under control; if oil prices rise we run the risk of getting hurt again.
 
Another significant casualty is going to be the India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor. The transport and communication corridor running from India to Europe through Saudi Arabia was aimed at countering China's Belt and Road Initiative. However, with the Middle East under war clouds, it will be some time before the multi-nation bonhomie can be resumed. Though insignificant, India's trade with Israel may be hit too. What is significant though is that India is a major importer of Israeli security technology. Given the failure of Tel Aviv's vaunted security system in detecting the Hamas attack, perhaps our government may want to order a review. Despite the coming crude price rise, the major task at hand for the government is to keep retail oil prices in check and ensure that inflation does not surge.

The discount in comparison to the Brent benchmark for the same month amounted to USD9.57 per barrel. This represents a 15 percent increase in Urals' average cost on an annual basis, considering that in October 2022, a barrel of Russian oil was priced at USD70.62.



However, when examining monthly fluctuations, Urals' price witnessed a slight decrease of nearly 2 percent in October, down from the USD83.08 per barrel cost in September.



Throughout the initial ten months of the year, the average Urals price exhibited a significant drop compared to the same period in 2022, reaching USD61.84 per barrel as opposed to USD79.57.



The International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that Russia's oil export revenue experienced a noteworthy boost of USD1.8 billion in September, attributed to both increased export volumes and higher prices for Russian crude and oil products. In total, Russia garnered USD18.8 billion from oil exports in September, marking the most profitable month since July 2022, as per the IEA's assessment.



Despite the attempts by the EU and G7 nations to enforce a USD60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil exports, the data suggests that these measures have been largely ineffective. These restrictions were initially introduced in December 2022 with the goal of curbing Russia's energy revenue.



In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin implemented retaliatory measures, effective from February 1, prohibiting oil and petroleum product supply to countries applying such price caps in their contracts, either directly or indirectly.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_OilEnergy_20.jpg,False,@menafn,16.623894,35f089f3d564df7a31136aed96e588c2

The country's current account deficit had started to spiral out of control due to the huge oil import bill and the rupee had been weakening due to the higher demand for dollars to buy expensive oil.

The price of the global benchmark Brent crude fell by 4.63 per cent to close at $77.42 per barrel on Thursday, while the US's West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell 4.9 per cent to settle at $72.90 per barrel.

An increase in US crude oil inventories, a rebound in US Treasury yields, and the easing of oil demand due to the global economic slowdown have contributed to the decline in crude prices. Prices have in fact been gradually declining over the last four weeks.

India's merchandise trade deficit rose to a record high in October and the decline in oil prices would bring respite in November.

The country imports over 80 per cent of its crude oil requirement and any increase in prices leads to a sharp increase in the current account deficit.

Higher oil prices also fuel inflation and cause the government's subsidy bill on LPG, CNG and fertilisers to go up which leads to a higher fiscal deficit.

Sugar stocks too witnessed fresh buying due to improved domestic demand. Two-wheeler stocks like Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor were also in focus amid strong sales growth witnessed during the festival season and rating agency's rising growth forecast, Khemka said.

While the secondary market saw a range-bound move, heightened action was seen in the primary market.

'We are seeing strong response to the IPOs that opened this week of which IREDA was subscribed 36x, while Tata Technologies and Gandhar Oil were subscribed 13x until now,"" he said.

Overall, the market is likely to trade sideways in the near term with stock specific action in the broader space, he said.

Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said Nifty remained range-bound while encountering resistance around 19,850.

On the hourly chart, an ascending triangle is forming, suggesting a probable upside breakout. Sentiment is anticipated to stay sideways as long as it holds above 19,700. However, a drop below 19,700 might exert downward pressure on the Nifty, he said.

Resistance at the higher end is established at 19,850; a significant move beyond this level could trigger a rally towards 20,200 in the short term, he added.

The market also responded to diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the Israel-Hamas conflict, alleviating concerns about global supply disruptions. Brent, the leading benchmark for global oil, traded 0.03 percent higher at USD89.68 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the key indicator for United States crude, dipped 0.15 percent to USD86.53 a barrel.



Monday saw Brent settle 1.36 percent lower at USD89.65, and WTI closed down 1.17 percent at USD86.66. Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at Oanda, noted that diplomatic efforts contributed to a tentative calm, easing immediate fears of disruptions in global crude supplies. However, Moya emphasized that the pullback in crude prices lacks a key catalyst to prevent the oil market from remaining tight in the short term.



The potential for a breakthrough in diplomatic talks between Venezuela's government and opposition further influenced market sentiment. Talks, set to resume, could lead to the easing of sanctions, particularly if they contribute to a positive outcome in the 2024 election, as suggested by President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela, holding the world's largest crude reserves, could benefit from sanctions relief, expanding its ability to export oil to more markets. Sanctions were initially imposed following Maduro's re-election in 2018.



The article will explore the intricate dynamics affecting oil prices, including the role of geopolitical developments, diplomatic initiatives, and the potential implications of eased sanctions on Venezuelan crude.

OPEC+ announced further production cuts for next year, to bolster oil prices that have recently tumbled amid a weakening economic backdrop. Several OPEC+ countries are to additionally cut a total of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, which aims to support the stability and balance of oil markets.

The reductions will be taken from the quotas adopted at the last OPEC+ ministerial meeting in June. It will add to the voluntary output cuts announced by OPEC+ countries in Apr and will last until the end of 2024, OPEC said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, will extend its voluntary production cut of one million bpd, which has been in effect since July, to the end of Q1 2024. Russia, a leading OPEC ally, will cut its oil exports by 500,000 bpd, up from the current 300,000 bpd, until next March.

Other OPEC+ countries, including Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, have pledged smaller cuts for Q1 2024, OPEC said.

Warren Patterson, ING's head of commodities strategy, noted that, instead of seeing further cuts distributed among the whole group, it was left up to individual members to decide whether they would make deeper voluntary supply cuts.

'Our balance sheet shows that, the additional voluntary cuts ensure that the marginal surplus that had been forecast for 1Q24 will be erased, and in fact, we now see a small deficit,' Patterson wrote on the ING website.

'This suggests that, there is some upside to our current 1Q24 ICE Brent forecast of US$82/bbl and full-year 2024 forecast of US$88/bbl,' he said,'However, this will largely depend on how OPEC+ goes about unwinding these cuts and obviously on how demand plays out next year.'

Crude prices failed to rally after the meeting, with Brent crude edging down 0.32 percent to settle at 82.83 dollars a barrel on Thursday.

Asset & Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) at Goldman Sachs believes that the price of a barrel of oil is likely to trade between 70 and 100 dollars for most of 2024. The forecast reflects slowing oil demand growth arising from tighter financial conditions and still elevated U.S. recession odds over the coming year.– NNN-XINHUA",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/02/NNN_ad847image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,18.148985,5ab0ef537c1e346fc69795d3dfa9f3f3

The S&P 500 slipped 17.84, or 0.4%, to 4,549.34 for its third straight loss, locking in its longest losing streak since October. Each of those drops was modest, though, and the index remains near its best level in 20 months.
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70.13, or 0.2%, to 36,054.43, and the Nasdaq composite lost 83.20, or 0.6%, to 14,146.71.
 
Energy stocks had the market's worst drops by far. Halliburton sank 3.6%, and Marathon Oil fell 3.5% after crude oil touched its lowest price since June.
 
A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude tumbled roughly 4% as expectations build that the world has too much oil available for the global economy's demand. It sank below $70, down more than $20 since September. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 3.8% to $74.30 per barrel.
 
Losses for Big Tech stocks, which are some of Wall Street's most influential, also weighed on the market. Nvidia dropped 2.3%, and Microsoft lost 1%. 
 
Helping to limit the market's losses was a gain of 1.9% for homebuilder Toll Brothers, which reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said demand from buyers has remained solid so far in the current quarter, thanks in part to slightly easier rates available for mortgages.
 
Mortgage rates have regressed as Treasury yields have dropped on hopes that the Federal Reserve may finally be finished with its barrage of hikes to interest rates, meant to get high inflation under control. Wall Street is betting 
the Fed's next move
 will be to cut rates, possibly as early as March, which would juice the economy and financial markets.
 
More reports arrived Wednesday that bolstered those hopes. The Federal Reserve's next meeting on interest rates is in a week, and the widespread expectation is for it to leave its main interest rate alone at its highest level in more than two decades.
 
One report said private employers added fewer jobs last month than economists expected. While no one on Wall Street wants to see widespread layoffs, a cooldown in the job market could remove upward pressure on inflation.
 
A more comprehensive report on the job market from the U.S. government will arrive Friday, one that can cause big swings on Wall Street.
 
'What we don't know is how much the markets have already priced in a slowing labor market, or how they will react if Friday's data comes in stronger than anticipated,' said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
 
A separate report on Wednesday said U.S. businesses were able to increase the amount of stuff they produced in the summer by more than the total number of hours their employees worked. That stronger-than-expected gain in productivity more than offset increases to workers' wages, and it could also keep a lid on inflationary pressures.
 
Treasury yields in the bond market were generally lower following the economic reports, and the 10-year yield fell to 4.11% from 4.17% late Tuesday. It was above 5% in October and at its highest level since 2007. 
 
Within the S&P 500, Campbell Soup was the biggest winner and rose 7.1% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected.
 
Travel-related companies were also strong as falling crude prices relieved some pressure on them. Carnival rose 5.9%, and Royal Caribbean Line gained 3.4%. 
 
Airlines also flew higher. Delta Air Lines climbed 3.5% after it told investors it's sticking to its forecasts for revenue and profit for the end of 2023. United Airlines rose 3.4%, and Southwest Airlines gained 3%. 
 
On the losing end of Wall Street was Brown-Forman, the company whose brands include Jack Daniel's whiskey. It fell 10.4% after reporting weaker earnings than analysts had forecast. It also cut its forecast for a measure of sales growth for the full year.
 
Shares of 
British American Tobacco
 sank 8.4% in London after the company said it will take a non-cash hit worth roughly 25 billion British pounds ($31.39 billion) to account for a drop in the value of its 'combustible' U.S. cigarette brands. It's moving toward a 'smokeless' world, such as e-cigarettes. 
 
Shares of Altria Group, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, fell 2.8%.
 
Wall Street could be setting itself up for disappointment if cuts to rates do not come as quickly as hoped. While Federal Reserve officials have hinted that their main interest rate may indeed be at a peak, some have said it's too early to begin considering when cuts could come.
 
Stock markets abroad were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2% after a top central bank official reiterated the Bank of Japan's will keep its monetary policy easy until it achieves a stable level of inflation.
 
Gains were more modest across the rest of Asia and Europe.

Californians for Energy Independence (CEI) has run

ads on Facebook and cable channels in Sacramento, Fresno and San Diego blaming state policies for limiting local production and raising gas prices in an apparent effort to sway lawmakers.

Consumer Watchdog pointed to experts and evidence that show decreased local oil production has no impact on California gas prices .

Crude oil prices are set on a global market. Moreover, California's in-state oil production has been decreasing since its peak in 1985, according to the

California Geologic Energy Management Division , and has little to no impact on world crude prices.

The group created a Consumer Alert video

warning the public about the phony ads.

""Limiting oil drilling in California has about as much impact on California gasoline prices as it does the price of tea in China,"" said economist Robert McCullough of McCullough Research. ""Crude oil prices are set on a world market that the level of California crude oil production does not impact.""

McCullough pointed out, ""Since California produces a declining share of the rapidly growing world supply of oil, minor variations in its supply do not affect world prices.

While the U.S. is the world's largest oil producer (20%), California is only 3% of U.S. production -- 3% of 20% is less than 6/10ths of one percent of the world supply.""

UC Berkeley economist Severin Borenstein has said even if oil is slightly cheaper to produce in-state, the price is still set at a rate competitive with product from overseas.

""Consumers will not benefit from more oil production in the state and they will not be hurt by less oil production in California,""

Bornstein said .

In a 2023

blog post , Borenstein wrote:

""While some crude is produced in California, the marginal source (which is what sets the market price) comes from elsewhere. Once crude is on a tanker, the price doesn't differ much whether it is being delivered to Japan, France, China, India, New York, or California... "" He cited his own co-authored

1997 academic study

to that effect.

""The difference between domestic and imported crude prices doesn't register at the gas pump, but if you really want to put a number on it, US West Coast refiners' monthly crude oil acquisition costs

averaged

about a penny per gallon cheaper for imported crude last year,"" said independent consultant Greg Karras.



""The main determinant of gasoline prices has nothing to do with decreased local production of crude oil,"" said Consumer Advocate Liza Tucker. ""Instead, the world price of crude oil is the yardstick determining the price of oil in California and California's long-declining production has no impact on world crude prices.""

Today only one quarter of annual oil supply to California refineries comes from in-state production because so many wells are spent, according to the

California Energy Commission .

""Regardless of permit activity, new wells aren't being drilled at accelerated rates, and those new permits are tapping into fields that have little resources left to give under normal economic situations,"" said Lindsay Buckley, a CEC spokeswoman.



Phony Front Groups

The oil industry

claims not to be behind

the ad campaign but the group ""Californians for Energy Independence"" sponsoring the

advertising

running on Facebook and cable TV channels was presented at the Washington Research Council as being ""activated"" by the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) to ""contribute"" to its advocacy goals in a 2014 internal presentation first made public by Businessweek. (see page 5:



)



The group is one of a host of groups created to protect WSPA's interests, according to the presentation. In the 2014 WSPA presentation, the litany of groups are broken out as designed to protect either

""upstream"" (crude harvesting) or ""downstream"" (refining) operations. Californians for Energy Independence (CEI) is labeled as a part of the ""upstream""

propaganda campaign.

So is another group running ads, listed under ""downstream"" and called Californians For Affordable & Reliable Energy.

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, President and CEO of WSPA, is listed as a ""principal officer,"" president and director at CEI, based on a 2021 IRS document,

according to E&E News . The California Independent Petroleum Association's CEO Rock Zierman is also listed as CEI director on IRS paperwork. Chevron is a major giver to CEI dating back to 2019, according to its lobbying disclosure filings at the Secretary of State Office.

Chevron donated $3.6 million

to the group in 2023, according to its filing at the Secretary of State Office. Aera Energy is also a big giver.

It donated $1 million in 2023, according to its

filing .

CEI and Californians for Affordable and Reliable Energy (CARE) have spent a combined $4.3 million to run ads on TV and Facebook this year to influence policy, according to data provided by AdImpact to E&E. One CARE

Facebook ad

blames ""a growing list of state-mandated programs and requirements that have rapidly increased energy costs compared to the rest of the nation-driving up costs on everyone and everything.""



CEI paid consultants Winner & Mandabach Campaigns

$4 million

in the first quarter of 2023 and another

$2.86 million

in the third quarter of 2023, according to filings with the Secretary of State Office.

Winner &

Mandabach is reportedly a consultant to the oil-industry backed referendum campaign

to overturn California's new law establishing a 3,200-foot setback between drilling operations and sensitive receptors from schools to hospitals and homes.

Steven Lucas, an attorney with the law and lobbying firm Nielsen Merksamer, is the

committee treasurer

of the ballot committee. The ballot committee has paid Nielsen Merksamer $332,000 for services during 2022 and 2023, according to committee lobbying disclosure forms. Lucas is also the registered legal agent signing state lobbying disclosure forms for CEI, CARE, WSPA (a Nielsen Merksamer lobbying client), Aera Energy and the California Business Roundtable.

""By hiding behind CEI, the oil companies hide their identities from the public and are running a shadow political campaign,"" said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. ""The public needs to know when they see these ads that they are 100% by the Chevrons, for the Shells and of the Exxons.""

CARE paid $3.15 million to political strategy and communications firm Applied Paradigms and another $263,000 to Unearth Campaigns, a digital campaign and ballot initiative consultancy, in the first quarter of 2023. The

filing

said lobbying activity concerned ""general issues regarding gasoline cost education, SBX 1-2: the legislature."" SBX 1-2 is a landmark law allowing the California Energy Commission to set a price gouging penalty on refiners ripping Californians off at the pump.

CARE members include WSPA, the California Independent Oil Marketers Association, and the California Business Roundtable, according to the

Natural Resources Defense Council .

Chevron

is a member.

According to its

third quarter filing

at the Secretary of State Office, the California Business Roundtable paid CARE $2.1 million and paid Unearth Campaigns $336,000 since January 1, 2023. WSPA also paid Unearth Campaigns $62,500 in the third quarter of 2023, according to its

filing

with the Secretary of State.

""It's the old Business Roundtable dodge,"" said Court. ""Oil companies pay the Business Roundtable, the Roundtable pays a group and washes the oil industry money clean. It's happened over the years with insurance companies and others. Only because this isn't express advocacy for a ballot initiative can the dodge work.""
