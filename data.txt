The agreement marks the latest move by Elon Musk’s group to lock down non-Chinese supplies. Tesla chief executive Eduardo Bartolomeo is seeking to improve the performance of Vale's miss-firing metals division and transform the business into the supplier of choice for US carmakers as they crank up production of electric vehicles. The price of nickel has gained almost 50 per cent this year to $30,000 a tonne due to strong demand from the automotive industry. Vale is best known for its huge iron ore business and has a large division that produces industrial metals, primarily nickel and other clean energy metals such as copper and cobalt.",

The announcement comes as its stock has come under pressure amid a broader downturn in the market, in sharp contrast to Tesla’s last stock split in August 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index is down 25.8 per cent year to date, and the decline in Tesla shares also comes as CEO Elon Musk pursues a takeover of Twitter, the social media company. The proposal follows stock splits by Amazon and Alphabet, whose shareholders approved similar stock splits earlier this year, and Larry Ellison will not stand for re-election to its board of directors. Ellison owns a 1.5 per cent stake in Tesla and has pledged $1bn to help Musk finance his Twitter takeover.",

His lawyers have claimed the company’s failure to provide more detail on bots and other fake accounts amounted to “a clear material breach” of the takeover agreement. On Friday, Tesla shares closed more than 9 per cent lower after Musk sent out emails declaring that “remote work is no longer acceptable” and demanding they show up for at least 40 hours a week in the office or find another employer. Meanwhile, a CNBC investigation has found Tesla paid a PR consultancy to monitor employees in a Facebook group and more broadly on social media. Amazon and Alphabet are spearheading what is shaping up to be the most intense political campaign by corporate America.",

The plant, which the company claims will eventually manufacture 500,000 vehicles a year, was originally supposed to begin production last summer, but has faced numerous challenges from local environmentalists and campaigners. Prime Minister of Brandenburg, the state in which Tesla’s factory is located, has awarded an operating licence for both a car factory and an adjacent battery plant on the 300-hectare site in Grünheide, as long as certain environmental and safety criteria are met. An opening ceremony for the car plant is planned for the end of March and some 3,000 workers have already been hired for the factory. The move comes as Musk has been accused of trying to thwart the unionisation of Tesla's workforce, which he has said will not stop employees at its Californian plant from holding a union vote.",

      "summary": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has announced that the company's plans to create robot helpers, will be unveiled this year. The robot, dubbed “Optimus”, is expected to be the most important product development work taking place at Tesla this year, given its potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time. This could have a significant impact on Tesla's wider automotive plans, such as the Roadster and Semi (originally slated for launch in 2020) and the Cybertruck (orig originally slated for release in 2021). However, analysts note that the Roadsters and Semi will be delayed until at least 2023, including as the firm prioritises development instead on a humanoid robot concept that will serve as an “incredible buddy like C3P0 or R2D2” with a personality that evolves to match its owner while also solving the economy’s labour shortage problem. The bigger issue is how robots will compete over resources with their meat-bag equivalents, and it is not at all clear it will be the robot. Elon Musk's numerous public declarations about how superhuman AI could be very bad for humans, and his numerous public statements about how it could be a bad guy competition suggests as much.",

The sales were made between Tuesday and Thursday, after Twitter's board agreed to Musk’s $44bn all-cash takeover approach. The electric car maker's share price slumped in the wake of news of the deal, with the drop blamed on concerns about potential share sales by Musk to finance the acquisition. Musk sought to head off worries that the sales would be the start of a spate of divestments, writing on Twitter that no further TSLA sales were planned after Thursday. The terms of the Twitter deal require him to come up with about $21bn in cash, though it is not expected to close for another six months. Musk has also promised to put up part of the Tesla stake as security for a $12.5 billion loan to help finance the Twitter acquisition, with banks backing another $13bn of loans that would be taken on by the company itself.",

More space, fewer accidents, more efficient driving, no CO2 emissions. But the technology behind it is still a black box for many people and fuels skepticism. How safe are self-driving vehicles really?\n\nIn the U.S., unions and consumer advocates are now turning to the government. They are calling for more regulation. Meanwhile, Waymo is fighting over its data, while Tesla once again has to justify its questionable features. The weekly review of autonomous driving.\n\nWaymo in dispute with transport authority over data\n\nGoogle sister company Waymo is suing the traffic authority in the US state of California. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) oversees the largest autonomous driving test program in the US.\n\nIn order to participate and receive a corresponding license for testing on public roads, developers must submit detailed reports on safety measures. These are subsequently published in part.\n\nAccording to Waymo, this represents a competitive disadvantage. Competitors could gain insight into company secrets. Waymo is now suing against a requested disclosure of sensitive data. A quick settlement is likely. The next court date is scheduled for February 22.\n\nCalls for more regulation in the USA\n\nU.S. unions and a consumer safety advocate are calling for stronger regulations on autonomous driving. The government is being urged to ensure that autonomous driving cars are truly safe before they flood public roads.\n\nJohn Samuelsen, president of the Transport Workers Union of America, worries about jobs and calls for proper and independent assessments by safety regulators. Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, argues for minimum performance standards: “We need to know what’s happening on our roads, and the way to achieve safety is through regulation.”\n\nThe opposing side, of course, sees it differently. Autonomous driving vehicles are not only safe, but they also make for safer roads, according to the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA). Traffic fatalities in the U.S. in 2021 were the highest they’ve been in fifteen years.\n\nActually, the new technology is supposed to make traffic safer and significantly reduce the number of collisions. According to Waymo’s study, autonomous driving is already preventing fatal accidents. However, U.S. citizens probably still do not feel safe in the presence of artificial intelligence.\n\nOne company may not be entirely innocent of the public skepticism surrounding the safety of autonomous driving systems: Tesla. The company’s combined driving assistance systems and associated beta software are marketed as “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving,” which could be described as subtly misleading.\n\nMost recently, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta 10 has been consistently inconsistent, occasionally ignoring warning signs. Even after further updates, there is no question of a safe autonomous driving system according to the SAE standard. FSD is still error-prone and does not get its phantom braking under control. This involves the vehicle braking at highway speeds for no apparent reason.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, complaints about inappropriate automatic braking have increased in recent months. In addition, Tesla agreed this week to disable an FSD feature under pressure from regulators. It reportedly allowed vehicles to run stop signs at low speeds without first coming to a stop. Not a good week for Full Self-Driving.\n\nA vision test for robocars is being developed in Sweden\n\nThe answer by way of regulation may soon come from Sweden. According to TechCrunch, startup Annotell has secured nearly $24 million in investor funding. Annotell provides a platform that enables developers of autonomous driving systems to subject their technologies to comprehensive testing.\n\nAmong other things, the analyses should be able to check the quality of the collected traffic and environmental data such as HD maps and improve them if necessary. Co-founder and CEO Daniel Langkilde describes Annotell’s work as “vision testing for cars to get their license, just like you take a test to determine if you’re fit to drive.”\n\nWhile Waymo and Tesla wrangle with regulators and unions criticize the entire industry, one company is driving away from everyone even without a Swedish eye test. Cruise launched the first driverless robotaxi service in the U.S. this week. In San Francisco, prospective customers can sign up for a free cab ride and drive around the city without a safety person.\n\nAccording to Cruise, the first ride reports from passengers were consistently positive. Although the experience of driving without a driver felt surreal to many, the robotaxis were in some cases smoother on the road than vehicles driven by humans. GM CEO Mary Barra called her test drive a “career highlight.”\n• Autonomous driving: Waymo and Geely show off new robo-taxi\n\nNote: Links to online stores in articles can be so-called affiliate links.

      "summary": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk's forecast for the fourth-quarter earnings call was \"nutty good\" and that production, not new products, will drive its stock. Increased scale and sales of Model Y cars, which are more expensive than Model 3s, are helping to keep operating margins in double figures. Rising costs included a generous award to the boss, but the company is relinquishing its reliance on boosting profit with carbon credit sales too. Tesla has made it clear that the focus this year is scaling up existing product output, and its brand far exceeds its sales. If it can top that figure, the share price should rise.",

The SEC had requested information on “governance processes around compliance” with the order, and Musk and Tesla each paid $20mn. The agreement stemmed from an August 2018 tweet in which Musk said he had the “funding secured” to take Tesla private at a share price of $420. Musk has continued to be vocal in his disdain for the SEC, and has suggested the agency be renamed the Short Seller Enrichment Commission. The settlement required Musk to step down as chair of Tesla’s board for three years, and since the consent decree has been in place, the SEC has sought to hold Musk in contempt of court when he tweeted Tesla would “make around 500k” cars in 2019.",

The question for shareholders in Tesla, still the only direct publicly listed avenue for investors wanting exposure to Musk, is to what extent his latest curiosity will distract him. Musk manages his time with a forensic level of detail, including splitting his working day into five-minute slots to maximise his output, and regularly putting in days that can run towards 20 hours. It is not yet clear how involved Musk intends to be in Twitter’s day-to-day management, but he will need to rely on a host of deputies at his operations.",

      "content": "Autonomous driving: Tesla under scrutiny, Cruise still on the rise\n\nTesla’s Autopilot faces criticism again, Cruise continues to outrun everyone, Waymo wants more robo-trucks and Baidu is expanding Apollo. The robocar week in review.\n\n\n\nThere was some news about autonomous driving again last week that you shouldn’t miss. General Motors subsidiary Cruise is brimming with confidence, reporting one success after another, while Tesla continues to struggle with the dark side of the technology – or rather, the mirages.\n\nIn China, the rumor of a possible takeover of Huawei’s smart car division by VW caused a stir. In the meantime, the AI giant Baidu expanded its robot cab network almost unnoticed by the Western world. Google’s sister company Waymo, meanwhile, is going all out with its robo-trucks. The week in review.\n\nTesla’s Autopilot is under scrutiny again\n\nTesla’s Autopilot continues to have a tough time. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is now launching an investigation because of a recurring problem with phantom braking in some Teslas. The Washington Post reported numerous complaints of inappropriate automatic braking back in early February.\n\nNow there are more details: In recent weeks, the NHTSA had received another 250 complaints from Tesla owners who were affected by unprovoked braking. Reason enough for the authority to initiate a search.\n\nSometimes the system mistakes a shadow for an object, sometimes the vehicle brakes for no apparent reason at highway speeds, or comes to a halt when a truck comes along in the far distance in the oncoming lane. In all, about 416,000 Tesla vehicles of the current Model 3 and Model Y are said to be affected.\n\nCruise and GM close to NHTSA license for commercial robo-taxis\n\nCruise is also currently dealing with the NHTSA, but for a much more positive reason. Together with parent company General Motors, the company has submitted an application to NHTSA to build and commercially operate an autonomous driving shuttle.\n\nThe vehicle in question is the Cruise Origin, which the company has had in the pipeline for nearly two years. The all-electric shuttle bus is designed from the ground up for autonomous driving, has no cockpit and accordingly no pedals or steering wheel. The electrically powered vehicle virtually consists only of a passenger compartment.\n\nCruise was recently granted a test license for a driverless, autonomous robotaxi service in San Francisco. This will use Chevrolet Bolts equipped by Cruise and powered by electricity. Production of the Cruise Origin is scheduled to begin later this year at GM’s Factory Zero Detroit Hamtrack Assembly Center.\n\nThe good news for Cruise isn’t slowing down. As TechCrunch reports, the company is looking to expand its joint project with backer Walmart. Last year, Walmart got on board with Cruise, announcing plans for a zero-emission, autonomous-driving delivery service.\n\nThe collaboration began in early 2022 as a pilot project in the US state of Arizona. There, a small fleet of self-driving Chevy Bolts delivers goods from a Walmart store near Scottsdale. That’s probably no longer enough for the cooperation partners. Over the course of the year, a total of eight stores across the country are to be equipped with the Cruise robot delivery service.\n\nBesides the U.S., the second world power in autonomous driving currently appears to be China. Countless tests are being conducted in major metropolitan areas and even dedicated roads are being built for autonomous driving. One of the top players there is the AI giant Baidu with its Apollo robotaxi division.\n\nLast Thursday, Baidu opened an Apollo branch in downtown Shenzhen. However, supervisors are still behind the wheel there for safety reasons. Apollo cabs serve fifty different stations in Shenzhen, a city of 13 million people. Passengers can book rides via the smartphone app Apollo Go. Apollo Go is the largest autonomous cab service in the world, beating out industry giants such as Waymo and Cruise.\n\nWaymo Via: Next collaboration for autonomous driving trucks\n\nWaymo has been flirting with autonomous driving trucks for some time. In Texas, Waymo is partnering with UPS to test robotic trucks that will transport freight between UPS’s Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston locations. Waymo is also working with JB Hunt and Daimler’s truck division. Its own robot truck service called Waymo Via is also in the pipeline.\n\nNow Waymo is embarking on its next truck collaboration. This time, the Alphabet subsidiary plans to work with fleet operator C.H. Robinson Worldwide to send autonomous driving trucks with safety drivers onto Texas roads in the coming weeks.\n\nRobinson CCO Chris O’Brien sees the development of autonomous long-haul trucks as making fleet planning easier. Even before the pandemic, he says, the company was struggling with a chronic driver shortage.\n\nWaymo continues to exercise caution with its robotrucks. “We also have a lot of humility that our technology solution is just one piece of a very complex puzzle,” said Charlie Jatt, head of commercialization for trucks at Waymo Via. It will take a gradual evolution to reap the full benefits, Jatt said.\n\nNote: Links to online stores in articles can be so-called affiliate links.

      "summary": "Tesla’s Autopilot is under scrutiny again, while General Motors subsidiary Cruise is brimming with confidence. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is now launching an investigation because of a recurring problem with phantom braking in some Teslas. Meanwhile, the AI giant Baidu is expanding its robot cab network and Google's sister company Waymo is going all out with its robo-trucks. Cruise and GM are also currently dealing with the NHTSA, with the company submitting an application to build and commercially operate an autonomous driving shuttle. The all-electric shuttle bus is designed from the ground up for autonomous driving, has no cockpit and accordingly no pedals or steering wheel. Cruise was recently granted a test license for a driverless, autonomous robotaxi service in San Francisco, and the company is partnering with Walmart for a zero-emission, autonomous-driving delivery service.",

      "summary": "Tech companies such as Tesla and Apple have seen a positive start to earnings week, with both companies struggling with component shortages due to the hardware crunch. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that its factories were running below capacity and supply chain constraints were becoming the main limiting factor. Apple's earnings call is after the market close on Thursday, and the US commerce department has found manufacturers’ inventories on average have only five days of chip supplies, as demand increased 17 per cent in 2021 compared to two years earlier. Ocado has unveiled a range of automation improvements from lighter robots to improved grocery picking, while Fireblocks became the highest valued crypto asset custodian on Thursday after raising $550m in a new funding round that puts an $8bn price tag on the company. Meanwhile, the safekeepers of crypto assets are attracting billions of dollars from investors, with Fireblocks becoming the highest-valued crypto Asset custodian. Despite this, consumer interest in plant-based meat has surged around the start-up Beyond Meat and other products, but sales growth is falling in the US and UK.",

The fix was agreed by Tesla after meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the US road safety regulator. Safety campaigners say rolling stops lead to more collisions, both with other vehicles and with pedestrians or cyclists. Tesla drivers using the FSD mode are able to select whether they want to be “chill”, “average” or “assertive” to set the driving behaviour, and the system warns drivers that when selecting assertive or average modes it might perform rolling stops. Tesla has not yet commented on the fix, but has faced several recalls or safety fixes at the behest of the regulator over its use of in-car technology, including a feature that allowed passengers to play video games on the cars’ large dashboard screens while the car was moving in December.",

      "summary": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a subpoena from the SEC relating to Tesla's compliance with a 2018 settlement that resolved a dispute between the agency and the electric carmaker over chief executive Elon Musk’s “funding secured” tweet. The SEC issued the subpoena in November asking Tesla to submit information on its compliance with an SEC settlement and its subsequent amendment, which required Musk not to comment publicly about anything “material” to Tesla shareholders without prior approval from a company lawyer. Musk and Tesla also each each paid $20mn in fines. The subpoena marked the latest chapter in the running battle between the regulator and Tesla boss, who rattled Wall Street in 2018 with a tweet declaring: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” The SEC subsequently charged Musk with securities fraud for misleading the market. Musk vehemently rejected the charges at first but ultimately agreed a settlement in which he stepped down as Tesla”s chair for three years. The latest subpoena was issued 10 days after Musk asked Twitter users in November to vote on whether he should sell 10 per cent of his Tesla stake, which was worth about $18bn at the time. Musk has since touched on subjects covered by the settlement, including a tweet in 2019 about solar panel production volumes, although he did not disclose whether he had sought approval first. The company has frequently taunted the SEC on Twitter, appearing to test the boundaries of the agreement.",

He also claimed that a new, purpose-built robotaxi without a steering wheel or pedals would reach production in 2024 and become a “massive driver of growth” for the company. The comments came as Tesla revealed that it had withstood the worst of the auto industry’s supply chain crisis to generate revenue and earnings above most Wall Street forecasts in the first quarter. The news lifted the company's shares about 5 per cent in after-market trading, erasing a loss of the same magnitude earlier in the day. Tesla has put off production of new vehicles such as its cybertruck until next year in the hope that focusing on existing models would enable it to scale up more quickly at new plants. However, Musk conceded that increases in Tesla's prices at a time when its profits are hitting records risked looking “unreasonable” but he said that long waiting lists meant many of the cars being sold would face higher production costs.",

      "summary": "Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess has claimed that the challenge of lifting production in order to become the largest electric vehicle manufacturer by 2025 will weaken its fiercest rival, Tesla, by the middle of the decade. He believes that VW can overtake Tesla by the end of the year, and that it will be a “tight race” to be the dominant electric vehicle producer by the mid-20th century. The confidence from the VW chief stands in contrast to comments made by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk last month that the company’s plants in Texas and Germany were “gigantic money furnaces right now” as they struggle to secure parts and accelerate manufacturing in the face of global supply chain bottlenecks. On Tuesday, VW also announced it had invested $450mn for a minority stake in its North American charging network, Electrify America, in a deal that values the division at $2.45bn.",

      "summary": "Tesla reported a record net profit of $2.3bn in the fourth quarter of 2021, despite supply chain constraints that have plagued the rest of the car industry. The electric carmaker warned that constraints in its supply chain would weigh on the company’s results “through 2022” as it reported a report that its factories “have been running below capacity for several quarters as [the] supply chain became the main limiting factor” and that the trend “likely to continue through 2022. Shares of the company dropped more than 5% but later traded 1.5% higher in after-hours trading as Musk, chief executive, spoke on an investor call. Despite supply chain headwinds, the company called 2021 a “breakthrough year” with its operating margin of 14.7% better than all volume carmakers, “demonstrating that [electric vehicles] can be more profitable than combustion engine vehicles” Shares of Tesla have slipped 22% this year, and Musk also pledged to “solve” full self-driving technology in 2022. He also said that efforts to introduce vehicles would cause total output to decline and the focus in 2022 would be on scaling up operations.",

President Joe Biden and Ford and Stellantis still plan to hire more workers for their electric vehicle expansion, while Intel plans to hire thousands more. Executives at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have offered similar views, but Tesla and other automakers have cast doubts on their abilities to reach EV production targets due to supply chain disruptions and shortages of raw materials for new batteries.",

The recall comes a day after Toyota announced a cut in its global production target for July, and now expects 800,000 cars will be produced in the month, down 50,000 from previous estimates.",

Musk has not yet said how he will finance the remaining $21bn of cash that he has promised, raising the possibility that he will need to sell billions of dollars’ worth of shares in the carmaker.

      "summary": "Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has played down fears that his $44bn offer to buy Twitter from the social media company's board has jeopardised his focus on the company's start-up empire. He also discussed the risks of mortgaging or selling some of his large personal Tesla stake and risks from a political backlash over the “free speech” absolutism he has promised at Twitter. He dismissed the suggestion that owning Twitter would add to the risks at his current businesses, citing habits already designed to handle brief and intense bursts of work as his restless focus shifts between his companies’ most pressing problems. Musk also highlighted the current Shanghai Covid-19 lockdowns as an immediate risk to Tesla’s fortunes, while emphasizing his close relationship with the Chinese government. Despite criticism of his over-reach, Musk projected a far more measured tone than in some recent appearances as he acknowledged the challenges of managing Tesla's growth.",

The lawsuit alleged that the bank had put its thumb on the scale in an effort to gain a windfall from Tesla shares last year. Tesla claims that JPMorgan's conduct between August 2018 and 2021 was \"entirely self-serving and intended to gain JPMorgan the improper benefit of a discount on the price of Tesla shares that were gaining rapidly in value\". A JPMorgan spokesperson said there is no merit to their claim and Tesla has asked for the bank's complaint to be dismissed.",

      "content": "On the evening of Sept. 30, a Friday, the world’s wealthiest man stood on a stage in Palo Alto and showed off a humanoid robot. Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., had first announced the effort a year earlier, promising it would usher in a revolution in artificial intelligence by presenting a robot that was really a dancer wearing a costume. This time a “production unit” of the droid, dubbed Optimus, had to be wheeled out by three engineers because its legs didn’t seem to work yet.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, shortcomings like this would be no big deal for Musk, who has for decades used his gonzo marketing instincts to create the celebrated Silicon Valley effect known as a “reality distortion field”—the perception that the regular rules and limitations don’t apply. Nobody’s been able to distort reality as much as Musk has. In the past, when he’s shown up with a barely functional prototype, the crowd of fans has gone berserk, the memestockers have pushed the share price up, and Tesla has secured a wave of preorders that add to its basically unlimited supply of working capital.",

      "description": "Tesla (TSLA) closed the most recent trading day at $123.18, moving +1.12% from the previous trading session.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) closed the most recent trading day at $123.18, moving +1.12% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.25%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.91%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the electric car maker had lost 37.43% over the past month, lagging the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 17.03% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.59% in that time.\n\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from Tesla as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Tesla to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 40%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $25.23 billion, up 42.39% from the year-ago period.\n\nTSLA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.07 per share and revenue of $82.5 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +80.09% and +53.29%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.28% higher. Tesla is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Tesla is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 29.96. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.09, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, TSLA's PEG ratio is currently 0.95. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Automotive - Domestic stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.08 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 153, putting it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Should Investors Buy the Recent Dip in Tesla (TSLA) Stock?",
      "description": "With TSLA 52% from its highs, investors may be contemplating adding Tesla shares to their portfolio. Let's take a look at the company's outlook and valuation to see if it is indeed a good time to buy TSLA.",
      "content": "Tesla TSLA shares saw a nice rally Thursday after better than expected CPI numbers gave the broader market a nice boost. TSLA stock recently hit a new 52-week low of $177.12 per share as Elon Musk liquidated more Tesla shares following his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWith TSLA 52% from its highs, investors may be contemplating adding Tesla shares to their portfolio. Let’s take a look at the company’s outlook and valuation to see if it is indeed a good time to buy TSLA.\n\nTesla reported its Q3 earnings last month and beat EPS expectations by 10% at $1.05 per share. The stock dropped despite the beat on the company’s bottom line. Top line growth was underwhelming, with sales missing expectations by 4% on revenue of $21.45 billion. Despite a record 343,830 deliveries during the quarter this slightly missed expectations as well.\n\nTSLA stock is down -46% YTD to underperform the S&P 500’s -22%. Tesla shares are still up 721% over the last three years to crush the benchmark and its peer group’s +7%.\n\nHowever, the company’s outlook is becoming more important with investors coming away less impressed with Tesla’s growth following its Q3 release. Tesla shares are still roughly down 14% since the report, even with its bounce Thursday.\n\nYear over year, TSLA earnings are now expected to rise 79% to $4.05. Fiscal year 2023 earnings are expected to rise another 30% at $5.29 per share. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to climb 54% this year and another 39% in FY23 at $115.38 billion. This is more than quadruple pre-pandemic sales of $24.57 billion in 2019.\n\nEarnings estimate revisions for this year and FY23 have trended up over the last 90 days. Rising estimate revisions are a good sign, especially with investors concerned over the premium paid for TSLA shares following its Q3 report.\n\nTrading around $190 per share, TSLA has a P/E of 43.8X. This is well above the industry average of 12.2X, which is where the premium may be a factor. However, Tesla remains the industry leader in the EV market and trades much lower than its decade high of 45,336X and the median of 236.9X. Also, industry peers like General Motors GM and Ford F are at far different stages of corporate life and aren’t experiencing growth like TSLA.\n\nTesla’s price to sales is becoming more reasonable again as shown in the chart above. TSLA’s P/S of 8.2X is much lower than its decade high of 31.3X and near the median of 7.9X.\n\nTSLA still lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its Automotive-Domestic Industry now in the top 27% of over 250 Zacks Industries. While there could be better buying opportunities ahead, Tesla continues to trade at a far better valuation than it has in the past. Also, electric vehicles are still a relatively small part of the auto industry market and the space still has massive potential to grow.\n\nTSLA still appears poised for growth and earnings estimate revisions are up from last quarter. Patient investors could be rewarded for holding the stock with the average Zacks Price Target suggesting 66% upside from current levels.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know",
      "description": "Tesla (TSLA) closed the most recent trading day at $157.67, moving +0.55% from the previous trading session.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) closed at $157.67 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.55% move from the prior day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 2.49%. At the same time, the Dow lost 2.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the electric car maker had lost 16.11% over the past month, lagging the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 8.04% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.14% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be hoping for strength from Tesla as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.20, up 41.18% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $25.45 billion, up 43.64% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.05 per share and revenue of $82.83 billion. These totals would mark changes of +79.2% and +53.9%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.37% lower. Tesla is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Tesla's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 38.68. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.36, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nInvestors should also note that TSLA has a PEG ratio of 1.23 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Automotive - Domestic industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.25 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 64, which puts it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has lagged the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 13.13% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.49% in that time.\n\nTesla will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.20, up 41.18% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $25.45 billion, up 43.64% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.05 per share and revenue of $82.83 billion. These totals would mark changes of +79.2% and +53.9%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.37% lower. Tesla is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Tesla has a Forward P/E ratio of 33.99 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.19, so we one might conclude that Tesla is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.08. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Automotive - Domestic stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.15 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, which puts it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Now -40% in a Month; Case-Shiller In Depth",
      "description": "The world's EV leader is now on pace for its worst month, quarter and full year ever.",
      "content": "Market indices closed Tuesday off their session lows, but it was another lackluster trading day across the board, with only the blue-chip Dow barely in positive territory, +0.11%. The S&P 500 lost -0.40% on the day, the Nasdaq fared the worst of the major indices, -1.38%, and the Russell 2000 was -0.61%. Reopening news from China was initially met with optimism, but this seems to have tempered over the course of the day.\n\n\n\nWhat looks like its taking the lion’s share of losses out of the tech-heavy Nasdaq is the much beleaguered Tesla TSLA, which hemorrhaged another -11.4% in the session and is now trading at a fresh 52-week low. The world’s EV leader is now on pace for its worst month, quarter and full year ever. It’s riding a seven-day losing streak and has now lost -68% year to date, -72% from its all-time high just 13 months ago.\n\n\n\nIt’s gotten so bad for the now-Austin, TX-based automaker that even the seasonal low-volume trading for most of the market isn’t helping: 200 million Tesla shares were traded just today alone. Shares are now beneath $110; a year ago they were up near $400 per share. And Tesla has lost -40% of its value in just the past month alone, when CEO Elon Musk started tinkering with his new toy, Twitter.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Musk does have a grand plan for turning Twitter around, but he’s not convincing many people — even some of his loyal supporters, of which he has had many. This is the man, after all, who built Tesla into a formidable car manufacturer that has now pushed other automakers into their own line of EVs, and has gotten SpaceX off the ground (pun definitely intended). But what looks like the main move now is for Musk to find a new CEO to look after his social media platform and return to stop the bleeding on the company that made him a household name in the first place.\n\n\n\nCase-Shiller Recap, In Depth\n\n\n\nA half hour before today’s opening bell, “new” Case-Shiller Home Price Index data came out for October, to +9.2% for the month from the +10.7% the previous month. We’re now at levels not seen since March of this year, and well off the June peak, by -4.6%. All cities in both the 10-city and 20-city surveys saw lower price increases month over month.\n\n\n\nThe 10-city came in +8.0% year over year, but down 160 bps month on month. The 20-city reached +8.6%, down nearly 2% from the +10.4% reported for September. As in other monthly housing figures we’ve seen recently, it’s clear interest rate policy has helped roll back housing prices, at least from peak highs mid-year, with the trajectory continuing to point the same direction.\n\n\n\nAs with the past couple Case-Shiller reports, Miami and Tampa Bay led the way in home price growth, +21% and 20.5%, respectively. Charlotte was third place, +15.0%, followed by Atlanta at +14.9% and Dallas +13.5%. Obviously, the Southeast and the South were by far the strongest sectors, +17.9% and +17.0%, respectively. The worst-performing cities, San Francisco (+0.6%) and Seattle (+4.5%), are both -10% from their peak in May of this year.\n\n\n\nNovember Pending Home Sales will be released tomorrow morning, adding to the housing market narrative. Expectations are for losses to tighten from the previous month. Other than that, weekly jobless claims and Chicago PMI are the only economic reports hitting the tape for the rest of the week. We may see some tax-related equity reshuffling before the markets put a wrap on 2022 1pm ET Friday, but other than that, we’re pretty quiet.\n\n\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

      "title": "Strength Seen in Tesla (TSLA): Can Its 8.1% Jump Turn into More Strength?",
      "description": "Tesla (TSLA) witnessed a jump in share price last session on above-average trading volume. The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions for the stock doesn't suggest further strength down the road.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares soared 8.1% in the last trading session to close at $121.82. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 42.1% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nShares of Tesla were up for the second straight day yesterday, after a seven-session losing streak. The electric vehicle (EV) leader has been witnessing massive sell-off lately and is the most oversold that it has ever been. There has been no specific news/development, which could account for the recent price surge. So, this might just be a brief respite and could be part of a late Santa Claus rally. Given the rising economic uncertainty, growing angst over Musk’s Twitter focus and fresh production challenges in China amid soaring COVID-19 cases, we don’t expect the rally to have legs.\n\nThis electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%. Revenues are expected to be $25.23 billion, up 42.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on TSLA going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTesla belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry. Another stock from the same industry, Harley-Davidson (HOG), closed the last trading session 1.8% higher at $41. Over the past month, HOG has returned -14.5%.\n\nFor Harley-Davidson , the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed +110% over the past month to $0.03. This represents a change of -78.6% from what the company reported a year ago. Harley-Davidson currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
      "description": "Zacks users have recently been watching Tesla (TSLA) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned -31.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 23.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of +40% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 points to a change of +78.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.21 indicates a change of +29% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tesla.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +43.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $82.83 billion and $114.27 billion estimates indicate +53.9% and +38% changes, respectively.\n\nTesla reported revenues of $21.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56%. EPS of $1.05 for the same period compares with $0.62 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.89%. The EPS surprise was +10.53%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is firing on all cylinders and its growth phase is only getting started. Shares are about to race much higher.\n\nElon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive tweeted in August that the electric car company has now made over three million vehicles, up from only 3,000 a decade ago. The manufacturing growth is remarkable.\n\nThe bull case for Tesla has always been a leap of faith. Even with its heady manufacturing growth, the Austin, Tex.-based company is a tiny player in terms of total vehicles made. Toyota (TM) built 10 million vehicles during 2021 alone, and that was in the midst of a parts shortage.\n\nDespite this, at a market capitalization of $904 billion, Tesla shares fetch Two-times greater than the combined value of Ford (F) ($63.6B), General Motors (GM) ($56B), Stellantis N.V. (STLA) ($48.5B), and Toyota ($259.6B).\n\nThe California New Car Dealers Association announced in August that Tesla produced the two top-selling vehicles in the state during the first half of 2022. This is a huge development. Its electric vehicles, the Model Y and Model 3, are more popular than long-time internal combustion engine best sellers like Toyota Rav4, Camry, and Corolla.\n\nTesla Model Y commands 54.2% market share in the luxury compact sport utility vehicle marketplace. The 42,320 units were sold in the first half compared to 7,856 Mercedes GLC-Class, the runner up. The comparable BMW, Audi and Lexus rounded out the top five, each having sold less than 5,500 units.\n\nAmong luxury sedans Model 3 took 60.8% market share over Lexus and BMW. Even the Tesla Model S bested its BMW, Mercedes, and Chevy Corvette comparables in the luxury and high-end sports car category, according to a report at Electrek.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss this data as a California thing. The state is notoriously green. It is also the biggest and most important car market in the United States. All carmakers compete there, and trends that start in California necessarily sweep across the country because automobile companies are reluctant to build two sets of vehicles.\n\nTesla’s growth is not limited to California.\n\nThe company has become a major player in China, where its Shanghai factory celebrated this week the manufacture of its 1,000,000th vehicle, according to the Musk tweet. That factory began production in 2019 and today is considered to be the most advanced facility in the world.\n\nBloomberg noted that recent upgrades put the factory on pace to produce 21,000 cars and SUVs weekly, more than 1,000,000 units annually.\n\nAnd Tesla has next generation factories coming on stream in Austin, Texas; and near Berlin in Germany. Those facilities will use so-called giga castings to shrink complexity. The massive rear casting reduces the number of pieces of sheet metal from 171 to 2 pieces of aluminum, while eliminating 1,700 welds. Musk says that casting can be optimized even further.\n\nThese are real competitive advantages that allow Tesla to build EVs faster and more efficiently. High average selling prices are maintaining profits margins. Tesla recently posted 26.5% profit margins, about 1,400 basis points higher than the industry average.\n\nHigh prices are having no impact on demand.\n\nDrive Tesla Canada reported Friday that Tesla has officially stopped taking new orders in the United States and Canada for the Model 3 Long Range, due to overwhelming demand. The new order configuration page now states flatly that the product is unavailable until 2023.\n\nInvestors should see the bigger picture, though. Tesla is in the poll position in the race to EVs, the future of the sector.\n\nAnalysts at Alix Partners expect EV sales to rise to 28% by 2028, up from the current level of only 3%. By 2025 the same analysts see the EV segment reaching 59%. In Europe market share during the same time frame is expected to jump to 44%, and 83%, respectively.\n\nSafety is for suckers.

      "content": "Tesla shares have suffered a massive drop in recent months, with noted Tesla analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities stating this week that CEO Elon Musk is viewed as “asleep at the wheel” from a leadership perspective.\n\nThe Street reports that on Tuesday, Tesla’s shares reached their lowest point in over two years, continuing a downward trend in the company’s worst annual performance to date. This follows news that Tesla has temporarily stopped production at its Shanghai plant due to declining demand in the world’s largest automotive market.\n\nAccording to Reuters, production at Tesla’s Shanghai plant has been suspended during the final week of the year, affecting the production of the Model Y sedan. This temporary shutdown is expected to result in a reduction of sedan production by approximately 30% compared to November.\n\nThis marks the first time that Tesla has intentionally reduced production levels at its Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018. While production at the plant has been temporarily impacted by both coronavirus-related restrictions and scheduled maintenance in the past, this is the first instance of voluntary reduction in output.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives commented: “With China the core linchpin to the Tesla bull thesis, worries are growing around what the softening demand picture looks like for 2023 given the dark macro clouds and increasing domestic EV competition.” Ives also reduced his fourth-quarter delivery targets for Tesla from 450,000 to 410,000.\n\nIves discussed the current view of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, writing: “At the same time that Tesla is cutting prices and inventory is starting to build globally in face of a likely global recession, (CEO Elon) Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla’s shares experienced a decline of 11.05 percent and were trading at $109.53 per share, the lowest point since August 2020. This drop extends the stock’s overall decline in 2022 to approximately 72.6 percent.\n\nA considerable portion of Tesla’s decline in 2022 happened in April, when Musk announced his intention to purchase Twitter. Musk contested the deal, but it was ultimately approved shortly before a hearing in Delaware Chancery and valued the social media company at $44 billion.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Musk borrowed approximately $13 billion from a banking group for the Twitter acquisition, including $3 billion in unsecured debt with an annual interest rate of 11.75 percent. The remaining portion of the debt consisted of $6.5 billion in term loans and $3 billion in secured bonds.\n\nTwitter is reportedly losing a significant amount of money, and Musk has been selling large amounts of Tesla stock. In mid-December, filings showed that Elon Musk sold approximately 22 million shares of Tesla, worth around $3.6 billion, despite stating earlier in the year that he had “no further TSLA sales planned” after April 28.\n\nRead more at the Street here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

      "description": "Tesla's stock has been a battleground for years. Bears have won the battle recently amid stock sales from Tesla's controversial CEO. Can bulls regain control?",
      "content": "If you follow markets, it should be no secret that Tesla TSLA stock rapidly declined over the past year. While the S&P 500 Index is down 18.2%, shares of Tesla are down a whopping 63.6%.\n\nWhat has led to the downfall?\n\n· Macroeconomic Conditions: Electric vehicles are a want rather than a need. While EVs have drastically come down in price since Tesla launched the Model 3, most traditional internal combustion engine-powered automobiles are more affordable. In other words, when the consumer is crushed by inflation, debt, and higher unemployment, purchasing an EV becomes less attainable.\n\n· Tax Selling:As the year ends, investors are taking inventory of the portfolio and are tax harvesting losing positions. In recent weeks, tax harvesting may have snowballed the selling behind shares in Tesla shares as many institutional investors and retail investors are stuck in underwater positions. As a result, active ETFs such as the Arkk Innovation ETF ARKK may be forced to sell shares at some point.\n\n· Concerns Over Management: It’s hard to argue with CEO Elon Musk’s business prowess. The controversial CEO is the mastermind behind Paypal PYPL, SpaceX, and several other successful ventures which propelled him to be one of the wealthiest humans ever to exist. Nevertheless, his actions and words in recent months have spooked investors. First, Musk acquired Twitter. In acquiring Twitter, shareholder concern about Musk’s time allocation began to increase. While Musk is known to juggle several ventures at once, the Twitter acquisition is his most immense undertaking yet. Second, Elon has been selling shares to pay for the Twitter acquisition. Insider selling is never looked at as a positive by shareholders. Lastly, the billionaire CEO has warned the public consistently about the potential for a “hard landing” caused by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.\n\nWhat do bulls have to hang their hats on?\n\n· Potential Capitulation Volume: Thursday, Tesla traded a whopping 205 million shares. The last time Tesla stock traded that many shares was in the middle of the Covid panic in March 2021.\n\n· Deeply Oversold Levels: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator that analysts use to measure a stock’s current and historical strength or weakness using closing prices over a recent trading period. Since its inception, TSLA has only had a more oversold reading than today in 2019. After the instance in 2019, shares multiplied twentyfold.\n\nPictured: Max chart of TSLA. The bottom shows historical RSI overlayled on the chart.\n\n· Stopping the Bleeding:Thursday, Elon Musk tried to instill investor confidence by saying that he will “not sell shares of TSLA stock until 2024 or 2025.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The last time Tesla stock traded that many shares was in the middle of the Covid panic in March 2021. \n\n· Stopping the Bleeding:Thursday, Elon Musk tried to instill investor confidence by saying that he will “not sell shares of TSLA stock until 2024 or 2025.”\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Over the last month, Tesla shares have significantly lagged behind the general market, down more than 15% vs. the S&P 500's marginal 0.6% gain.",
      "content": "When thinking of exciting investments, Tesla TSLA shares undoubtedly jump to the forefront of many minds. After all, it’s easy to understand why, as the company has entirely changed the way we see the automotive industry.\n\nAnd it goes without saying that TSLA shares have rewarded investors handsomely over the last decade, up more than a mind-boggling 6000%.\n\nHowever, over the last month, TSLA shares have significantly lagged behind the general market, down more than 15% vs. the S&P 500’s marginal 0.6% gain.\n\nWith shares deep in the red year-to-date, it raises a valid question: how does the company currently stack up? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nDespite the recent poor share performance, Tesla has consistently delivered better-than-expected bottom-line results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 10% in its latest print.\n\nIn fact, Tesla has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven consecutive quarters, all by double-digit percentages.\n\nStill, revenue results have come in under expectations as of late, with the company penciling in back-to-back revenue misses. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.\n\nDespite a hawkish Fed and rising logistical costs playing spoilsport for the company, Tesla still boasts an impressive growth profile; earnings are forecasted to soar nearly 80% Y/Y in FY22 and a further 30% in FY23.\n\nThe projected growth in earnings comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 54% in FY22 and 38% in FY23.\n\nIt’s no secret that Tesla shares are pricey, currently trading at a 6.1X forward price-to-sales ratio. Still, on a relative basis, the value is beneath its 6.5X five-year median value and highs of 23.9X in 2021.\n\nTSLA carries a Style Score of a “D” for Value.\n\nTesla TSLA shares have displayed a high level of weakness relative to the general market over the last month, indicating that sellers have taken a tight grip.\n\nStill, despite the poor share performance, Tesla has managed to post strong bottom-line results, chaining together a nice streak of positive EPS surprises that are all in the double-digit percentage range.\n\nIn addition, investors will have to fork up a hefty premium for the company’s shares, typical within stocks with high-growth profiles.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "description": "For Tesla (TSLA) in China, there's a bit of good news and some potential bad news.",
      "content": "For Tesla (TSLA) in China, there's a bit of good news and some potential bad news.\n\nAccording to Tesla China through news agency Xinhua, the automaker delivered 100,291 EVs from its Giga Shanghai factory in November — an all-time record and the first time it's topped 100,000 deliveries.\n\nThe figure represents a 40% rise month-over-month from October and a nearly 90% increase from a year ago. This follows month-by-month increases at Giga Shanghai after Tesla performed upgrades at the factory increase to production.\n\nHowever, it seems the upgrades may have been too productive, at least in the short term for Tesla. Reports from both Bloomberg and Reuters suggest Tesla will now cut production at Giga Shanghai, a possible sign demand is falling in the region.\n\nTesla is said to make cuts in production as early as this week, with reductions estimated at around 20% from full capacity. Giga Shanghai was running at full capacity in both October and November.\n\nBloomberg reports the decision to cut production was made “after the automaker evaluated its near-term performance in the domestic market, one of the people said, adding that there’s flexibility to increase output if demand increases.”\n\nTesla is denying the reports of a production cut in Shanghai, however. In a statement to Reuters, Tesla said media reports claiming Giga Shanghai would cut December output were \"untrue.\"\n\nThat being said, any potential cuts in production come after the automaker decreased prices for its cars in China earlier in October and also increased insurance incentives in order to boost supply.\n\nIn addition, competition is heating up in China’s EV market, the world’s largest. BYD, backed by Warren Buffett, posted nearly 230K deliveries last month, with nearly 114K EVs and 116K hybrids.\n\nFrom a pure output point of view, Gigafactory Shanghai is extremely productive, delivering more than 650,000 vehicles so far this year easily topping last year's total of 484,130, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The CPCA said Giga Shanghai's annual sales could possibly hit 750K units in 2022.\n\nEven if Tesla cuts production by 20%, the factory would be producing around 80K units a month, meaning it could theoretically reach nearly 1 million vehicles produced, making it the most productive EV factory in the world.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "title": "Oppenheimer downgrades Tesla stock, calls sentiment 'severely ...",
      "description": "Investors and the media are following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s plans for Twitter closely, but one Wall Street firm has had enough.",
      "content": "While investors are on edge awaiting the latest from Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s plans for Twitter, one Wall Street firm has had enough.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch downgraded Tesla stock to Perform from Outperform in a note to clients published Monday morning, saying challenges regarding Twitter have left sentiment towards Tesla shares \"severely damaged.\"\n\nSince Musk took ownership of Twitter in late October, Tesla shares are down about 30%.\n\n\"The combination of Twitter's unclear cash needs and diminishing options for Mr. Musk to serve those needs amid the broad public backlash driven by inconsistent standards application for Twitter users, notably banning select journalists, is pushing us to the sidelines on TSLA,\" Rusch wrote in a note to clients. \"We believe increasing negative sentiment on Twitter could linger long term, limiting its financial performance and become an ongoing overhang on TSLA.\"\n\nRusch's downgrade comes after an eventful weekend for Musk's leadership at Twitter, which resulted in a surprise poll from the billionaire on Sunday, which asked users whether he should step down as head of the social media company.\n\nMusk said he would abide by the results, which did show a majority support Musk leaving the top spot.\n\nRusch added: “We see potential for a negative feedback loop from departures of Twitter advertisers and users due to inconsistent standards resulting in increased financing needs that may lead to incremental TSLA sales just as Tesla's competitive environment intensifies.\"\n\nThose increased financing needs may have led Musk to sell 22 million shares of Tesla stock last week, worth around $3.6 billion. The overhang from those share sales sent Tesla shares tumbling 16% last week.\n\nReports over the weekend also said Musk is seeking additional equity investors for Twitter. Tesla shares were down more than 2% early Monday.\n\nRusch, however, believes it's not just the threat of large stock sales weighing on the stock, it's Elon Musk’s continued polarizing presence at Twitter that is damaging the Tesla brand.\n\n“While we have understood Twitter’s potential cash needs as a risk for TSLA shares, we believe banning journalists without consistent defensible standards or clear communication in an environment where many people believe free speech is at risk is too much for a majority of consumers to continue supporting Mr. Musk/TSLA, particularly people ideologically aligned with climate change mitigation,” Rusch wrote.\n\nRusch is not bearish on Tesla from a pure technology and expertise point of view, however. The firm believes Tesla is still driving down costs for EV manufacturing in the long term, and other manufacturers will struggle to match its efficiency.\n\nMoreover, Rusch sees this split between Musk's public drama related to Twitter and Tesla's actual business creating plenty of opportunity for investors.\n\n\"We expect TSLA to present myriad trading opportunities long and short,\" Rusch wrote. \"We believe sentiment is severely damaged and that any positive fundamental news near term will likely lead to select short covering followed by subsequent re-shorting.\"\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "A video of a Tesla Model Y driver losing control of their vehicle in Chaozhou in the Guangdong province made the rounds on social media this weekend. The accident resulted in three injuries and two deaths — and Tesla says data shows the driver didn’t hit the brake during the crash, Bloomberg reports.\n\nYou can watch the video below, though discretion is advised:\n• None These Are Your Guilty Pleasure Cars\n• None The 15 Most Successful Formula 1 Cars of All Time\n\nThe footage was captured on CCTV cameras. The driver appeared to attempt to park before the Model Y took off at high speed, traveling for around 1.2 miles. During that time, the driver collided with a motorcyclist and a high school girl on a bicycle, killing both. The driver, too, was injured.\n\nPolice are investigating the situation, and Tesla has agreed to cooperate. But the sparse details we have so far are strange. From Bloomberg:\n\nTesla, however, denies that post; it says that data pulled from the Model Y shows that there was no proof the brakes were ever engaged, which is backed up by the fact that the brake lights do not appear during the video. Further, Tesla said that the accelerator remained engaged during the incident — even reaching 100 percent activation.\n\nTesla also noted, though, that the driver did press the ‘Park’ button four times while traveling at high speed. However, the button must be pressed for an extended period of time for the vehicle to come to a stop.\n\nThis is far from the first time a Tesla in China has faced accusations of failed brakes, though so far, those claims have been unfounded, and several Tesla drivers later recanted their statements and apologized for spreading misinformation; Tesla, though, did offer a general apology for unrest.\n\nAs such, it is currently impossible to speculate on what happened in this incident, apart from what can be seen in the video. Whatever the result of the crash, it is deeply unfortunate that it has resulted in the deaths of two.\n• None These Cars Should Never Have Been Killed Off\n\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

      "description": "\"It's basically a peek behind the curtain into what made electric cars interesting over gas cars,\" YouTuber MKBHD said.",
      "content": "• A YouTube review of a 2008 Tesla Roadster shows how much the carmaker has evolved in 14 years.\n• Tesla's first model was a tiny sports car that was built off a Lotus Elise.\n• Since Tesla went public in 2010, the car company's value has soared over 26,000%.\n\nA recent review of Tesla's first car model from YouTuber Marques Keith Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, highlights how Elon Musk has helped transform the car brand from a fledgling startup to the top electric-car maker in the US.\n\n\"This is the most analog electric car I have ever sat in,\" MKBHD said. \"It's basically a peek behind the curtain into what made electric cars interesting over gas cars.\"\n\nMusk became Tesla's CEO in 2008. The same year, the automaker released the Tesla Roadster which was built on the chassis of a Lotus Elise — a tiny British sports car that Tesla remade into an electric car with a lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe car had just over a 240-mile range and sold for around $100,000. Tesla produced fewer than 2,500 Roadsters between 2008 and 2012. Today, the cars have become top collectors items and have sold individually for over $200,000.\n\nSince the electric-car maker went public in 2010, Tesla's value has soared more than 26,000%. Meanwhile, Teslas have become sleeker, faster, and even cheaper. The first Tesla was a little rough around the edges, as MKBHD points out. It didn't have Tesla's signature door handles, key fob, or giant screen.\n\n\"It's not designed to be comfortable,\" MKBHD said in the video, as he struggled to get into the tiny car. \"It's a fun piece to drive for a little while.\"",

      "title": "Elon had to choose between Twitter and Tesla. He's choosing Tesla.",
      "description": "The billionaire has faced questions from Tesla shareholders over where his priorities lie as the company's stock has sunk since he took over Twitter.",
      "content": "• Elon Musk has been forced to make a tough choice: Tesla or Twitter.\n• The billionaire has faced pressure from Tesla shareholders over his role at Twitter as shares have fallen.\n• In a poll, more than 17 million people said Musk should step down as Twitter CEO.\n\nPerhaps he was caught up in the euphoria of it all. But after spending the World Cup final in the stands of Qatar's Lusail Stadium on Sunday with one Jared Kushner and a gang of Gulf sheiks, Elon Musk decided to put a poll up on Twitter asking if he should stand down as CEO.\n\nAfter more than 17 million people cast their votes, the verdict is in: a majority of 57% think the billionaire Twitter owner should step aside. Musk said he would \"abide by the results of this poll,\" prompting speculation about an imminent resignation and suitable replacement candidates.\n\nThe poll came moments after Musk issued a mea culpa for introducing a new Twitter policy barring users from posting links to their profiles on rival social media sites such as Instagram, Mastodon, and Nostr – a move that sparked fury from users. Twitter deleted the policy after less than 12 hours.\n\nIn an analyst note on Monday, Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said the poll's results are not a surprise \"given that since Musk has taken over Twitter in late October it's essentially been a debacle of epic proportions.\"\n\nBut the poll ultimately comes as Musk needed to decide which company to run: Tesla or Twitter. His electric vehicle company got hammered last week by both analysts and shareholders, forcing him to choose which he wanted more.\n\nHe's picking Tesla, which represents nearly alf his $156 billion in estimated wealth, and the Twitter poll gave him a handy escape pod.\n\nMusk has faced questions about how he manages more than one compan for as long as he has been in the spotlighty. Overseeing Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, or Neuralink alone would be enough to keep even the most sure-footed CEO busy.\n\nWhen Twitter was added to the mix, Tesla backers were rightly concerned about yet another responsibility falling on Musk's shoulders. Those concerns coming to a head last week.\n\nOn December 14, Tesla's third-largest individual shareholder Leo KoGuan tweeted his frustrations with Musk, suggesting that he \"abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO.\" He said Musk should find a successor with independent supervision from the board of directors.\n\nRoss Gerber, a fellow Tesla shareholder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, tweeted on Saturday that \"it is in the best interest for Tesla shareholders for Elon to be back at Tesla working full time.\"\n\nThe frustrations are warranted. Tesla's market capitalization has tumbled to less than $500 billion for the first time since November 2020, a drop that wasn't helped by Musk selling off 22 million Tesla shares worth around $3.6 billion last week, according to SEC filings.\n\n\"If you look at the share price it continues to suffer,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. \"I think the markets are thinking, 'The person who drove this company to what it has got to has now taken an eye off the ball.'\"\n\nIn total, Musk has sold off around $23 billion in Tesla shares since announcing the Twitter takeover, as the size of the gamble he has made in buying Twitter – one he likely realized after trying to back out of the deal — has become more apparent.\n\nAlong with equity from investors including Sequoia Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority, the deal is financed by $13 billion of debt from a syndicate of banks including the likes of Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Barclays.\n\nIn an analyst note published on 14 December, Wedbush's Ives said that \"the Twitter nightmare continues as Musk uses Tesla as his own ATM machine to keep funding the red ink at Twitter which gets worse by the day.\"\n\nThat red ink wasn't as much of a problem when interest rates were low, and Tesla's shares were soaring. It was easier to use Tesla stock to fuel the kind of wild bet Musk made earlier this year when floating the idea of buying Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nBut as the Federal Reserve has aggressively hiked interest rates to curb inflation, using Tesla stock to pay off the debt on the Twitter buyout is a problem for Tesla.\n\n\"It's a major burden for the company, because it will get more expensive, or likely more expensive,\" Beauchamp said. \"It's something else to worry about.\"\n\nMusk seems painfully aware of the negative impacts of the wider economic downturn, tweeting on December 13 to \"beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates,\" shortly before news of his sale of Tesla stock became public.\n\nHe has also tried to defend the erasure of around $600 billion in Tesla market value by blaming the Fed. Responding to Gerber, he said that \"Tesla is executing better than ever,\" but \"we don't control the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nHowever, Tesla's challenges go beyond this, with the company underperforming the NASDAQ significantly in 2022, which has seen a broad range of tech businesses facing the same headwinds but without the same plunges in stock price.\n\n\n\n\"Tesla is so much an Elon stock, it stands or falls because of him,\" Beauchamp said. Tesla's stock price responded positively on Monday to the poll's results, rising almost 5%.\n\nThe Twitter chief has previously suggested he'd seek to find someone else to run Twitter in due course. Some close allies, such as computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman, have volunteered to run the social media company.\n\nBut Musk seems clear on how tall a task he'd be handing over, having botched several plans already, such as a new verification subscription plan and a seemingly arbitrary decision-making process on banning journalists, all while seeing advertisers flee the platform.\n\nOn Sunday, he tweeted: \"No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\"",

It was easier to use Tesla stock to fuel the kind of wild bet Musk made earlier this year when floating the idea of buying Twitter for $44 billion. \n\nBut as the Federal Reserve has aggressively hiked interest rates to curb inflation, using Tesla stock to pay off the debt on the Twitter buyout is a problem for Tesla.",

After enjoying a brief rally late last week on hopes that China's rolled-back zero-COVID policies might allow its economy to grow a bit faster -- and permit Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to produce a few more electric cars there as supply chains unsnarl -- Tesla stock hit a bump in the road today. The reason is a poll released by the international research data and analytics group YouGov.

      "description": "There are more headaches for Tesla (TSLA) as the automaker revealed it is recalling 321,000 vehicles due to a safety issue.",
      "content": "There are more headaches for Tesla (TSLA) as the automaker revealed it is recalling 321,000 vehicles due to a safety issue.\n\nIn a filing posted over the weekend on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website, the automaker said some Tesla Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs had an issue that caused the tail lamps to “intermittently illuminate,” meaning poor visibility on the road in some instances. Tesla said the brake lights were not affected by the issue.\n\nTesla became aware of the issue from owners of cars in non-U.S. markets, and after investigating the issue, decided to perform a voluntary recall in order the fix the tail light malfunction. The recall will be performed via an over-the-air software update.\n\nThis weekend’s filing comes right after last Friday’s recall of around 30K Model X SUVs in the U.S. over a front passenger air bag issue, which will also be corrected with an OTA software update.\n\nTotal recalls for this year for Tesla now stand at 19 in the U.S, affecting nearly 3.77 million vehicles. Only Ford (F) has more vehicles affected by recalls, with approximately 8.8 million covering 63 recalls, according to NHTSA data. Note that vehicles can be subject to multiple recalls, so the exact number of vehicles affected by a recall this year is actually smaller than the total amount listed by NHTSA.\n\nNevertheless, mounting recall and remediation measures needed does take a toll on Tesla’s resources, at a time when the company is ramping up production across the globe as it tries to reach its 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) goal for vehicle deliveries, which would be around 1.4 million cars. CEO Elon Musk warned last quarter that the 2022 deliveries goal would likely be missed, though production figures would surpass a 50% growth rate in Q4.\n\nMeanwhile, call are growing for Musk to focus more attention on the issues at hand at Tesla instead of spending time dealing with Twitter, which Musk purchased at the end of October. Growing competition from traditional automakers, and a weakening global economy, may hurt Tesla’s EV-market dominance.\n\nTesla’s stock price has been affected by these concerns, with shares down over 50% year to date.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "All right. What's your takeaway from the results we just saw? Look, I think clearly the 3Q do every miss. There was an expectation that revenues could be light. I think margins will be a focus. Came in light there. The street was hoping ultimately for a better margin performance. I think really the headline sticking to the underlying 50 percent growth for the year in terms of deliveries to the conference call is going to be key in terms of are they backing away from that? Clearly they're not. It shows the China growth story still continues to be there. And that's really going to be the bull bear to be come out of this call. About the demand story, you see. What do you see as the difference between the US and China? I know there have been some concerns about wait times in China shrinking, which, you know, counterintuitively is maybe not a good sign. Sure. I think in China productions rammed through CAC. So if you look at wait times, what's happened there? That's going to start to stabilize. But ultimately, the production out of China continues to really increase. Look, that's the hearts and lungs of the tests of bull story in terms of China. Now, if you look what's happened from a macro perspective, no, clearly we're seeing softness, but we believe what we're seeing in tests is much more logistics driven rather than demand driven. And that, in my opinion, is why I think this is just more massive speed bumps are navigating. But ultimately from Moscow, it's a moment of truth. I mean, this is the time to sort of navigate through the turbulence because investors see a white knuckles concerned. Are you about the battery situation? Look, I'm concerned about it. But ultimately, as we go into first half of next year, I believe that does start to stabilize. I still believe demand is outstripping supply for Tesla. And that's why it's all about can they fulfill two million units in terms to go into 2023 if they can, then test is a stock that, in my opinion, could be up 40, 50 percent from these levels. But in this backdrop, this report, in my opinion, it's must most important conference call probably in the last two and a half, three years. It might also be the last conference call before he buys Twitter. Right. A deal could be sealed in a matter of days. And we've seen Tesla shares very much intertwined with what's happening with Twitter. Are you expecting a potential negative impact from that deal? I mean, you've talked about I mean, naturally the albatross around the tassel story, because ultimately the worry is the financing in this market starts to fall through a bit. Does he have to come up with more capital? Do you see for him for is does he sell an incremental 5, 10 billion dollars of Tesla's stock to fund Twitter? And that's why the frustration now for the Tesla investors is it feels like musk jug and a lot of balls. You've got the Twitter situation. And right now he's continuing to trade caviar for two dollars, slice of pizza in terms of Twitter stock. Are you worried about the ball mean that's in there? Well, I think that's that's one of the biggest problems, is that mosque is the key to the Tesla story. He's ultimately really the reason that Tess has been able to get in this position. And I think he really needs to ultimately give investors confidence that he's their pilot on the plane. And you're not ultimately going to see shortfalls as we go into Q4 and especially going 2023 in such a pivotal year for E.D.. What do you want to see and what do Tesla investors want to see in terms of his management approach to Twitter? Like not managing Twitter at all? Well, I think part of it as a tacit investor, you want ultimately see him navigate this and only give the reins to social media experts. That could ultimately be the ones that could try to turn Twitter around from most. The easiest thing was buying Twitter. The hardest part is going to be fixing it. That's going to be an ever psych uphill battle from Musk in terms of fixing Twitter. But as a Tesla investor at such a crucial time, you need steady hands. And that's really why this conference call, the next few quarters are just so crucial. What I believe is in the history of the Telstra story. Well, it may be for on honestly almost every company, given the macro economic conditions that we're facing and Moscow potentially now multiple companies that are facing these macro economic conditions. What's your outlook over the next six months as we potentially head into a recession and a downturn that could last? Some people are telling me two to three years. I think in terms of disruptive technology who are going to be the winners over the next two, three years. Tesla's front and center, along with Apple and a handful of other names like Microsoft. When you look at Tesla as we went back three years ago, look how they navigate through what I view as almost historic challenges. MUSK The challenge is not demand. It's logistics. And if you look at China, I believe this will ultimately be a period of time that test was able to navigate. And I do believe the multiple starts to reread. You start to ultimately see margins start to come back. And I think we look at this as just a blip on the radar over and over and overall called five, six years. Cyber track. What do you want to hear because you want to hear it that's come in 2023 because you got all the Detroit stalwarts that are ready to get those trucks out there. Also, you have Revere and others. This is going to be an arms race in terms of pickup truck for evey need to make sure it doesn't keep continue. Get to lead. But it goes back to your navigating space X Tesla. Now Twitter and there is, you know, ultimately which kid you love the most. And that's going to be the issue for much because the golden child continues to be tested. We hear so much about Gwynne Shotwell at Space ISE. How deep is the bench at Tesla if his attentions are divided? Well, it's no different. If Judge and Stan. We're not playing for the Yankees, right? Yeah. You got it. You got a bench there. But ultimately, Musk is continue to key to the Tesla story. They have navigate a bit of a bench, but which is the clear? I mean, that is the biggest worry right now in the story. And of course, time's ticking. Next Friday, that's when the Twitter deal is supposed to close. Otherwise, we end to a Game of Thrones and Delaware.",

      "description": "The firm said ongoing negative headlines around Twitter could create a 'negative feedback loop' that could hurt sales of Tesla vehicles.",
      "content": "Elon Musk's handling of Twitter is damaging sentiment around Tesla , according to Oppenheimer. Analyst Colin Rusch downgraded shares of Tesla to perform from outperform, saying he can no longer separate coverage of the electric vehicle maker from Musk's controversial management of the social media platform. \"While we continue to see Tesla evolving EV and autonomous technology in advance of peers and driving costs to levels those peers will struggle to match—and have tried to separate Elon Musk's non-Tesla endeavors (personal and professional) from our analysis on TSLA—we believe Mr. Musk's acquisition and subsequent management of Twitter now make that separation untenable,\" Rusch wrote in a Monday note. \"The combination of Twitter's unclear cash needs and diminishing options for Mr. Musk to serve those needs amid the broad public backlash driven by inconsistent standards application for Twitter users, notably banning select journalists, is pushing us to the sidelines on TSLA,\" he added. Tesla shares, which are notably volatile, are down 57% this year. However, the analyst expects that the ongoing negative headlines around Twitter could create a \"negative feedback loop\" that would hurt sales of Tesla vehicles. \"[We] believe banning journalists without consistent defensible standards or clear communication in an environment where many people believe free speech is at risk is too much for a majority of consumers to continue supporting Mr. Musk/TSLA, particularly people ideologically aligned with climate change mitigation,\" Rusch said. The analyst removed his price target of $436 price target on Tesla. Shares of Tesla closed at $150.23 on Friday. \"We believe increasing negative sentiment on Twitter could linger long term, limiting its financial performance and become an ongoing overhang on TSLA,\" Rusch wrote. To be sure, Musk conducted a poll Sunday asking Twitter users whether he should step down, with most respondents voting yes . Musk said there's no successor in place at the moment. Tesla shares jumped 4% in the premarket. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Elon Musk sold around $3.6 billion worth of shares of his flagship company Tesla this week, despite reassuring investors in April that he had “no further TSLA sales planned” after he secured the funds to acquire Twitter in a $44 billion deal.\n\nThe sale was revealed in an SEC filing submitted by Musk showing that between Monday and Wednesday he offloaded around 22 million shares of the electric vehicle company.

The financial struggles have cost Musk his title of “Richest Man In The World,” with Bernard Arnault, founder and CEO of LVMH, taking over the top spot on the Forbes list earlier this week.\n\nDespite the stock dump, Musk has tweeted several times this week that investors should remain confident, writing that he would “make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term.”\n\nInvestors and executives at Tesla have raised concerns regarding Musk’s shifted focus to Twitter. On Wednesday, Tesla’s third-largest shareholder, investor Leo KoGuan, tweeted that Musk had “abandoned Tesla” and that the company “has no working CEO.” Other prominent investors have echoed the concerns. Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black tweeted that the market was indicating that “the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”\n• None The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nClick here to read the full article.",

      "content": "NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is growing again, but there’s little comfort for the industry. The $760 billion electric-vehicle manufacturer produced nearly 366,000 cars in the third quarter, a 41% increase from the previous three-month stretch that also reversed a first-half slump. The number of cars it delivered to customers, however, fell 5% short of what analysts were expecting, which the company attributed to shipping woes. Tesla shares tumbled 8% on Monday.\n\nFreighters that haul vehicles have experienced a sticky price surge since the pandemic started despite broader supply-chain improvement. Various measures of shipping rates, including Drewry’s World Container Index and the Baltic Dry index (.BADI) – down 20% this year – show cost pressures elsewhere easing. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (XWGSCP=ECI) has declined for four straight months to its lowest reading since January 2021.\n\nPut it altogether, and the changes imply that the car business keeps struggling even with signs of improving access to microchips and moderating costs in other sectors. Ford Motor (F.N), for one, issued a profit warning for the third quarter. With additional problems mounting, Tesla and its peers are spinning their wheels.

      "content": "Elon Musk cut nine percent off the price of a new Tesla, but only if it’s one made and sold in China; Hyundai wants you to know that it’s a luxury carmaker now; and the U.S. is gonna need to mine a whole lot more lithium for all these upcoming EVs. All this and more in The Morning Shift for Monday, October 24, 2022.\n\n\n\nWe’re always moaning about the lack of an affordable electric vehicle and the cost of cars, on the whole, going up and up. But, after incrementally hiking the prices of its cars for years, Tesla has started lowering them again - but there’s a catch.\n• None The 2022 Civic Si Sure Seems To Make More Power Than Honda Says\n• None You Can Now Sleep In A Retired Semi Truck Trailer Tiny House\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Tesla is chopping up to nine percent off the cars it makes and sells, but only in China. Bloomberg reports:\n\nThe cuts only apply to the Model 3 and Model Y cars produced in China, but include Performance, Rear-Wheel-Drive and Long-Range variants. The firm attributes the price cut to “improved utilization of the company’s Shanghai factory and “relative stability” of the supply chain.”\n\nHere in the U.S., there has so far been no such cut. The Model 3 still starts at $48,490 and the Y is offered from $67,990.\n\nToyota likes to remind everyone that it was one of the first companies to mass-produce a hybrid car. The Prius, when it launched in 2000, quickly won the hearts of many eco-conscious drivers and now continues to do so with its fourth generation.\n\nBut times have changed, and drivers worried about their environmental impact have sold off their Prius (Prii, Priuses?) and switched to EVs. Toyota, however, didn’t get that memo so has appeared reluctant to make the switch to battery-powered cars. Now, the company is trying to rectify this with a new approach to electrification. Reuters reports:\n\nWhile the proposals are scrutinized, Toyota has reportedly suspended work on some of the 30 EV projects announced in December, which Reuters reports could include the Toyota Compact Cruiser crossover and the battery-electric Crown.\n\nSo Toyota is delaying EVs while it decides how it wants to roll out EVs. That definitely sounds like the behavior of a company committed to making EVs.\n\n3rd Gear: Hyundai Wants to be a Luxury Carmaker\n\nCar maker of the moment, Hyundai, cut its teeth making affordable cars that offer something for everyone. But now, the Korean automaker wants you to know that it’s serious about something, and that something is luxury EVs.\n\nThat’s right, Bloomberg reports that Hyundai is switching its focus to high-growth segments such “luxury models, SUVs and electric vehicles” as it targets “record-high earnings.” The announcement came after the automaker missed its sales and earnings targets for the third quarter of 2022. According to Bloomberg:\n\nDespite struggles for its global sales, Hyundai did have a pretty good third quarter stateside. Sales increased three percent compared with the same period last year.\n\n4th Gear: We Need to Mine More Lithium\n\nBut if Hyundai and other legacy automakers want to switch to focus on electric vehicles, they’re going to need more supplies, a lot more supplies. Chief among those supplies are all the components required to make bigger batteries, including lithium.\n\nHere in the U.S., miners extract roughly 1,000 tons of lithium each year —accounting for just one percent of global lithium production. But, after the Inflation Reduction Act added stipulations for EVs made with components sourced and assembled here in America, that output is going to need to rise dramatically.\n\nAccording to Automotive News, the electric car industry needs “about 50 more lithium mines” to open around the world to keep up with demand. Steps are being taken to try and ramp up lithium production to meet the demands for Evs, as Automotive News reports:\n\nBut, the site warns that new mines face a raft of hurdles before they can get up and running. Chief among them is the way the U.S. hands out mining permits for companies hoping to extract lithium from the Earth.\n\nThis, it warns, can mean it takes up to a decade to open a new lithium mine here in America. And if this process can’t be streamlined, we may soon be talking about a lithium shortage as well as a chip shortage, aluminum shortage, and titanium shortage.\n\n5th Gear: ‘Flying Taxis’ are Apparently Going Into Production\n\nAnother week, another flying taxi prototype that’s definitely going to exist. The world’s rich and powerful seem obsessed with the idea of zipping around cities in personal quadcopters that they like to pretend are flying cars. Now, there’s a new one that promises that it will actually make it to production, maybe.\n\nA company called Archer Aviation claims it will build 250 battery-electric air taxis in 2025, before moving to scale up production in the following years. Reuters reports that the firm hopes to have its craft certified to fly before all this, with sights set on 2024 for that milestone.\n\nWhen this, and all the other drawings of aircraft go into production, the electric flying taxi market, or whatever people want to call it, is set to be a pretty crowded space. As Reuters reports:\n\nI, and many other people remain unconvinced by all these personal flying machines. Will they ever make it to market? And, if they do, will the rules and regulations governing flying around cities adapt quickly enough to keep up?\n\nHow was your weekend? I hope it was nice! I spent mine dog-sitting and listening to the new Arctic Monkeys album, which coincidentally is called The Car. By my count, there are four tracks on there that talk about cars, and that seems like enough to warrant a mention here. Go listen; it’s perfect.\n• None Ducati Drops Two New Scrambler Models With Throwback Style\n\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

      "title": "Tesla Closes Flagship China Showroom",
      "description": "Electric vehicle giant Tesla has closed what had been its flagship showroom in China, a move sources described as one aimed at paring retail costs in its second-largest market.",
      "content": "Tesla confirmed the closure of the showroom in Beijing's upscale downtown shopping center Parkview Green to Reuters on Wednesday. It said it had relocated the store to another mall called Raffles City. That showroom was opened in mid-October and is smaller than the original two-floor showroom in Parkview Green.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the matter previously said Tesla had shut the Parkview Green showroom late last week. The store, opened in 2013, was Tesla's first in China and was renovated and expanded in 2018.\n\nA member of the mall's staff confirmed to Reuters during a visit to the site on Wednesday that Tesla had shut the showroom, whose windows are now plastered with posters belonging to the next tenant, a streetwear brand BAPE.\n\n\"Their contract with us expired and Tesla decided not to extend it,\" the mall staff member said.\n\nA call to the store earlier in the day was redirected to the Raffles City showroom.\n\nTesla owns and runs over 200 outlets across the country that display models and arrange test drives for potential buyers.\n\nReuters reported in September that Tesla was considering closing some showrooms in flashy malls in cities like Beijing after traffic plunged during COVID restrictions.\n\nIt also plans to put more emphasis on stores in less-costly suburban locations that can also provide repairs as the company works to meet Chief Executive Elon Musk's goal of improving service for customers.\n\nAs part of that effort, Tesla has been hiring technicians and other staff for service jobs in China. The company's China recruitment website showed 305 openings for service jobs as of Wednesday, little changed from September.\n\nMore than half of Tesla's China stores do not offer repair or maintenance services and are in high-rent locations where space is limited. That included the now-closed Parkview Green Tesla store.\n\nTesla owns all of its own stores rather than relying on dealers. It also sells its cars online. That has allowed it more leeway to adjust a retail strategy that had been initially modeled on Apple's glossy stores in high-rent locations.\n\nTesla has cut starter prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China, reversing a trend of price increases across the industry amid signs of softening demand in the world's largest auto market.\n\nTesla sold 318,151 vehicles in China in the first nine months of 2022, up 55% from a year earlier, according the China Passenger Car Association. By comparison, overall sales of electric vehicles and hybrids increased 113.2%.",

      "title": "Tesla critic claims his anti-Tesla ad was banned from Twitter for ‘political’ reasons",
      "description": "Dan O’Dowd delights in annoying Elon Musk.",
      "content": "The Dawn Project, an anti-Tesla advocacy group fronted by software developer Dan O’Dowd, claims that Twitter rejected its attempts to promote a tweet about a full-page ad running in The New York Times criticizing Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature. In a screenshot of an email provided by the group, Twitter said the tweet contravened its policy regarding “political” ads.\n\nThe rejected ad was the latest development in a weird, long-running feud between Elon Musk and O’Dowd, who ran a failed campaign for US Senate in California earlier this year. In August, Tesla sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Dawn Project over the group’s YouTube videos of Tesla vehicles running over child-size mannequins. (The videos no longer appear on the group’s YouTube page.)\n\nThe Dawn Project’s tweet about the Times ad is still up, but the group is not able to promote it, which could limit its engagement.\n\nThe group’s claims also raise questions about Twitter’s advertising policy in the wake of Musk’s takeover of the social media company. Several major car companies, including GM, Jeep, and Volkswagen, have paused all paid advertising posts on Twitter as they wait to see what the platform will look like under the new leadership. Meanwhile, Musk has tweeted that Twitter has suffered a “massive” drop in advertising revenue, even as user growth is at an “all-time high.”\n\nIn a statement, O’Dowd said the ad’s rejection was a troubling sign. “The move to prohibit the advertising of content criticizing Musk’s Tesla Full Self-Driving software raises serious questions over his commitment to free speech,” O’Dowd said in a statement. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Musk has fired 50 percent of the company’s employees, including most of the public communications team.)\n\nContent that references a candidate, political party, elected or appointed government official, election, referendum, ballot measure, legislation, regulation, directive, or judicial outcome. Ads that contain references to political content, including appeals for votes, solicitations of financial support, and advocacy for or against any of the above-listed types of political content, are prohibited under this policy. We also do not allow ads of any type by candidates, political parties, or elected or appointed government officials.\n\n“Twitter globally prohibits the promotion of political content,” the company says on its support page. “We have made this decision based on our belief that political message reach should be earned, not bought.”\n\nO’Dowd launched a campaign for Senate earlier this year premised on one issue: Tesla. He has been highly critical of the company’s FSD driver-assist feature, conducting his own tests that he claims highlight the technology’s critical shortcomings. (O’Dowd only got 74,916 votes in the June primary, coming in 10th overall.)\n\nThe Santa Barbara billionaire clearly relishes irking Musk. He previously ran a full-page ad in The New York Times disparaging Tesla’s FSD, offering $10,000 to the first person who could name “another commercial product from a Fortune 500 company that has a critical malfunction every 8 minutes.”\n\nTesla supporters note that O’Dowd runs Green Hills Software, which does business with some of Tesla’s competitors, including General Motors, BMW, and Ford. Tesla’s supporters note that he has a financial stake in publicly shaming the company. Meanwhile, Musk responded to the Dawn Project in his own fashion, noting that no one has died while using FSD and labeling Green Hills Software “a pile of trash.”\n\nSince taking over Twitter last month, Musk has moved swiftly to put his imprimatur on the social media platform. The company banned several accounts for impersonating Musk, including comedian Kathy Griffin and Mad Men actor Rich Sommer. Musk later announced that “any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended.”",

      "content": "Washington, DC (CNN Business) Tesla will hold its second annual AI Day in Palo Alto, California, Friday evening. The six-hour event will include updates on Tesla ( TSLA )'s work in artificial intelligence, \"Full Self-Driving,\" its supercomputer \"Dojo\" and maybe a humanoid robot, according to invitations posted online by Tesla supporters. The event is expected to be live-streamed.\n\nDojo is a supercomputer being designed to train AI systems to complete complex tasks like Tesla's driver-assistance systems Autopilot and \"Full Self-Driving,\" which sometimes perform some driving tasks like steering and keeping up with traffic. Tesla's previous AI Day included detailed technical explanations of the company's work in a bid to attract leading engineers.\n\nTesla CEO ElonMusk has claimed before that in the long run people will think of Tesla as an AI company, rather than a car company or energy company. He has said that Tesla AI may play a role in computers matching general human abilities, a huge milestone many experts say is decades away and perhaps unattainable . Musk, who has a long history of predictions, has said it may be reached in 2029.\n\nBut more limited and easier to develop forms of artificial intelligence — like identifying emergency vehicles stopped on a highway — have proven to be a significant hurdle for the company as it pursues its dreams of self-driving cars. AI powers \"Full Self-Driving,\" but the system has faced criticism and backlash as it still requires driver intervention to prevent collisions and Musk's deadlines for its capabilities slip year after year.\n\nAnd this summer Tesla's director of artificial intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, exited the company, several months after it was announced he was taking a sabbatical.\n\nIt's not easy to predict what may or may not show up at any event helmed by Musk. Products heralded and talked about sometimes don't perform as designed — like when Musk showed off the Tesla Cybertruck's supposedly \"unbreakable\" windows, that promptly broke — and can't even be bought years later. (Three years after the event Tesla sells a T-shirt that memorializes the broken window, but it has yet to sell a Cybertruck.)\n\nMusk has unquestionably disrupted entire industries with his work at Tesla and SpaceX. But he's also earned a reputation for missing deadlines and overpromising.\n\nMusk then claimed that the automaker is building a 5-foot-8, 125-pound humanoid robot, called Optimus or Tesla Bot and a prototype would likely be unveiled this year. It's unclear if a prototype will be revealed Friday, but Musk tweeted Thursday that the event would include \"cool hardware demos.\"\n\nMusk claimed last year that the humanoid robot would have a profound impact on the economy. It would begin by working on boring, repetitive and dangerous tasks, he said.\n\nHumanoid robots have long fascinated the public and earned a place in pop culture as powerful but sometimes dangerous. Tesla tapped into this when it posted on Instagram in a promotion for the event that, \"if you can run faster than 5 mph, you'll be fine.\" The Tesla humanoid robot is planned to have a top speed of 5 mph, the automaker has said.\n\nBut creating a humanoid robot that rivals a human's abilities has proved incredibly difficult for robotics experts. Artificial intelligence has seen major advances yet trails the general abilities of a human toddler. Most robots in use today are restricted to simple tasks in basic environments like vacuuming a home or moving parts in a factory.\n\nMusk said Thursday that AI Day would be \"highly technical\" as it is meant for recruiting engineers to work on artificial intelligence, robotics and computer chips.\n\n\"Engineers who understand what problems need to be solved will like what they see,\" Musk tweeted Friday.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "content": "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nChina ADRs – Shares of China-based companies that trade in the U.S. rose in the premarket after the easing of Covid restrictions by the Chinese government. Among them: Alibaba (BABA) was higher by 1.5%, JD.com (JD) gained 2.2% and Pinduoduo (PDD) was up 2.1%.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) – Southwest slid 4.1% in the premarket following thousands of flight cancellations over the holiday weekend, a higher amount than experienced by other major airlines amid winter storm issues. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) all rose in premarket action.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – Tesla fell 5.3% in premarket trading, after falling for six consecutive trading days and nine of the past ten. Tesla is down about 65% for the year to date, and on pace for its largest-ever yearly loss. The latest slide follows news that the automaker will run production at a reduced rate at its Shanghai factory in January, following an end-of-December shutdown.\n\nPeloton (PTON) – Peloton is selling refurbished bikes at discounts of up to $500 compared with new ones. The new program is the latest effort by Peloton to boost demand, following the expansion of its rental program earlier this year. Peloton rose 1% in the premarket.\n\nNio (NIO) – Shares of the Chinese electric car maker slumped 6.4% in premarket trading after it cut its fourth-quarter delivery forecast, saying the Covid breakout in major China cities constrained its supply chain.\n\nFarfetch (FTCH) – The luxury e-commerce platform operator was assigned a B- rating by S&P Global Ratings with a negative outlook, which noted the company's significant negative cash flow. Farfetch rose 1% in premarket action.",

      "title": "‘Tesla has no working CEO’: As stock drops 61% from its peak, a major Tesla shareholder calls for Elon Musk’s ouster",
      "description": "Tesla investors are starting to wonder if CEO Elon Musk is still the right man to lead the company after he acquired Twitter.",
      "content": "Tesla investors are starting to wonder if CEO Elon Musk is still the right man to lead the company. With much of Musk’s attention focused on Twitter, which he’s shaking up following his $44 billion takeover in late October, doubts are increasing about his ability to effectively lead the electric-vehicle maker.\n\nIt doesn’t help that he’s sold vast quantities of his personal Tesla shares this year as the carmaker’s stock has plunged about 61% from its peak late last year. That includes the sale of $3.6 billion in stock that he disclosed on Wednesday. He tweeted in April, after selling 4.4 million shares for $4 billion, “No further TSLA sales planned after today.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Leo Koguan, one of Tesla’s largest individual shareholders, called for a leadership change, tweeting: “Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO. Tesla needs and deserves to have working full time CEO.”\n\nLeo said someone more focused on the operational side of the company, similar to Tim Cook at Apple, should take over the company. Cook became Apple CEO after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs, who like Musk was strong on the visionary side.\n\n“Elon is a mere hired hands,” Leo added. “He is our employee…Elon was the proud father, Tesla has grown up. An executioner, Tim Cook-like is needed, not Elon.”\n\nLeo’s comments were in sharp contrast to ones he himself offered in January, when he tweeted, \"Tesla bulls, the future rainbow are here and now. Smile to your fortunate self.\"\n\nAt that time, Tesla had a market cap of $1.2 trillion and ranked among the world’s most valuable companies. On Wednesday, its market cap dropped below $500 billion for the first time since Nov. 23, 2020.\n\n\"For investors, the clock has struck 12. Frustration has massively built, and Musk appears to be doubling-down, not backing away,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nIves believes Musk overpaid for Twitter by about $20 billion and needed to tap into his Tesla shares to pay for the acquisition.\n\n\"One of investors' bigger concerns is that Musk is using Tesla as an ATM machine,\" Ives said. \"That has been a massive overhang on Tesla's stock.\"\n\nAnother concern is that Musk’s perceived lean toward far-right beliefs on Twitter could translate to left-leaning car buyers avoiding Teslas. They’ll certainly have more options, with more automakers piling into the EV space. S&P Global Mobility recently predicted that Tesla’s market share in the U.S. will drop from 65% this year to below 20% by 2025.\n\nGary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund and a Tesla shareholder, tweeted on Wednesday about Musk: \"He will realize soon (if not already) that his polarizing political views are hurting customer perceptions of $TSLA EVs. Customers don't want their cars to be controversial. They want to be proud as hell to drive them — not embarrassed.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \n\nRishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year\n\nMeet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation\n\nHow much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home\n\nElon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’",

      "description": "Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his individual capacity, he offloaded Tesla shares to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load.",
      "content": "Tesla stock has declined by roughly 19% over the past month (21 trading days). There are multiple factors weighing on the stock. Firstly, Tesla continues to be weighed down by CEO Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of the social media app Twitter. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his individual capacity, he offloaded Tesla shares to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load. In early November, he sold another 19.5 million Tesla shares, per an SEC filing, in a transaction worth $3.95 billion. The Twitter acquisition might also be seen as an unwanted distraction for Mr. Musk, forcing him to take time away from his role at Tesla. Separately, there are also concerns that Tesla’s growth could cool off amid a broader economic slowdown, particularly in markets like China. Tesla cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China in October and Chinese tech media Huxiu reports that another price cut could be around the corner.\n\nHowever, now that Tesla stock has seen a decline of about 19% over the last month, will it continue its downward trajectory in the near term, or is a recovery imminent? Going by historical performance, there is a 69% chance of a rise in TSLA stock over the next month. in the last ten years that Tesla stock saw a twenty-one-day decline of 19% or more, resulted in the stock rising over the (twenty-one trading days). This historical pattern reflects 90 out of 130, or a 69% chance of a rise in TSLA stock over the coming month , implying a positive near-term outlook for the stock. See our analysis on Tesla Stock Chance of A Rise for more details.\n\nCalculation of ‘Event Probability’ and ‘Chance of Rise’ using the last ten years’ data\n• After moving 1.5% or more over five days, the stock rose in the next five days on 58% of the occasions.\n• After moving -6.7% or more over ten days, the stock rose in the next ten days on 56% of the occasions\n• After moving -19% or more over a twenty-one-day period, the stock rose in the next twenty-one days on 69% of the occasions.\n\nWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

      "title": "Down 50% This Year, Is Tesla Stock A Buy?",
      "description": "While growth stocks in general have been hit by high inflation and rising interest rates, Tesla faces a couple of other challenges.",
      "content": "Tesla stock has seen considerable selling pressure losing about 50% of its value over the year. While growth stocks in general have been hit by high inflation and rising interest rates, Tesla faces a couple of other challenges. Firstly, there are real concerns that demand could be slowing down, particularly in China, which has been a big source of growth for Tesla. The company cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China in October, and Bloomberg recently reported that Tesla has planned to scale back production of the Model Y by 20% at its Shanghai factory. Separately, Tesla continues to be weighed down by CEO Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of the social media app Twitter. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his personal capacity, he has been offloading Tesla stock to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load. This has created an overhang over the stock. The Twitter acquisition might also be seen as an unwanted distraction for Mr. Musk, forcing him to take time away from his role at Tesla.\n\nWe have reduced our price estimate for Tesla stock by about 10% to $272. However, our price estimate still remains about 50% ahead of the current market price. Tesla’s execution has been solid so far and the company has a goal of growing its deliveries by over 50% each year over a multi-year horizon. While this plan could be challenged in the near term given the mounting economic headwinds, Tesla should remain a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to electric drivetrains. Production capacity has traditionally been a big bottleneck for Tesla and the company has been addressing this, with new factories in Texas and Berlin coming online and ramping up capacity. Tesla is also slated to bolster its model lineup. The Cybertruck pickup truck is likely to go into production next year while deliveries of the semi truck recently began. Tesla’s margins are also among the highest in the auto industry and this should enable the company to be solidly profitable as sales rise further. See our analysis on Tesla Valuation: Is TSLA Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on Tesla’s valuation and how it compares with peers. For more information on Tesla’s business model and revenue trends, check out our dashboard on Tesla Revenue: How TSLA Makes Money.\n\nWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Our high-quality portfolio and multi-strategy portfolio have beaten the market consistently since the end of 2016.",

      "content": "It will be another big quarter for Tesla (TSLA), and the markets overall, when the EV giant reports Q3 earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nThat revenue figure would represent more than a $5 billion jump from Q2, where Tesla experienced COVID-related and operations optimizing shutdowns in Shanghai. Year over year that estimated revenue figure would be a nearly 61% jump from Q3 of 2021.\n\nOn the profitability end, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income and EBITDA figures that are higher than a year go and higher sequentially.\n\nLooking ahead to the earnings call, investors and analysts will be focused on any clues to the demand story for Tesla, which some are concerned might be cooling off in the face of a Fed-induced slowing economy.\n\n“While we believe demand for Tesla products exceeds supply, it would be unreasonable to assume that there is (a) a limit to how much Tesla can continue to increase prices without demand suffering and (b) that the company was not exposed to decelerating macroeconomic growth,” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas said in a note to investors two weeks ago.\n\n\"A top concern right now is demand in China as wait times seem to be shrinking,\" RBC Capital Markets said in a note. \"Question is if this is a blip or signs of a bigger change among consumers.\"\n\nOf course Tesla’s production outlook will also be scrutinized, with analysts looking for any change to Tesla’s 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) target. The ramp-ups in Giga Berlin and Austin will also be top of mind, as well as whether Giga Shanghai is fully back after its latest idling due to operational improvements.\n\nOn the products end, there will be an expectation for CEO Elon Musk and the team to share more information on the rollout of Tesla semi, which Musk said will begin deliveries in early September to Pepsi and whether there will be more updates coming on the Tesla Cybertruck’s industrialization process as well as its future product roadmap.\n\nFor others on the Street, in order to stop the free fall in Tesla shares the company must outline a realistic plan for growth, with analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives saying they're “laser-focused” on its strategy for getting there.\n\n“For Musk the clock has struck midnight for the Street to stop the excuses and noise ... Now is the time to execute on reasonable growth and unit targets into 4Q/2023 and it starts with tomorrow's conference call,” Ives wrote in a note this morning.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "Tesla Earnings Preview: Sales, Semis, & Shanghai In Focus\n\n            With the looming sale of Twitter playing out in the background (along the capital needs necessary to facilitate it coming due), we can't say we'd be surprised by an \"optimistic\" spin on Tesla's earnings this afternoon. \n\nThe company is expected to post earnings of $1 per share, down from $1.06 per share, and $22.1 billion in revenue, down from $22.7 billion. \"Analysts are penciling in an operating profit of about $3.9 billion, compared with $4.1 billion earlier,\" Barron's reported on Wednesday. \n\nOf the largest questions up in the air for the company is going to be demand. With extra production facilities coming online in the months prior to a global economic slowdown and increased competition, Wall Street will be looking for cues as to whether or not Tesla can remain competitive in the increasingly saturated EV space. \nSource: Barron's\n\nAt the end of September that the company was urging employees to help keep up with incredible delivery demand. electrek dutifully reported at the end of September that Tesla was expecting a \"very high volume\" of vehicle deliveries during the end of the quarter. \n\nWhile they did produce a record for the quarter, the numbers fell short of some Wall Street estimates. Tesla also recently set a record for the number of vehicles it delivered in China, despite the fact that the number missed some Wall Street estimates. \n\nThe China Passenger Car Association revealed the numbers earlier this month. They mark an 8% increase from August and \"outpaced the more than the 5% month-over-month growth of all wholesale electric vehicle sales in China\", CNBC noted. \n\nThe prior sales record was set in June when the company sold 78,906 China-made vehicles. The new record comes after Tesla shut down Shanghai for a portion of the summer in order to upgrade the facilities. \n\n\n\nSource: @Sino_MarketRecall, the automaker also broke total delivery records for Q3, despite the fact that it missed expectations from Wall Street for the quarter. Tesla reported 343,830 deliveries for Q3 2022.\n\n\n\nThe company delivered 325,158 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and delivered 18,672 Model S and Model X vehicles. It blamed logistics for its miss of estimates and noted that a number of vehicles were \"in transit\". \n\n\"Historically, our delivery volumes have skewed towards the end of each quarter due to regional batch building of cars.  As our production volumes continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistics weeks,\" the company wrote in its press release earlier this month. \n\n\"In Q3, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter.  These cars have been ordered and will be delivered to customers upon arrival at their destination.\"\n\nDuring today's conference call, which Elon Musk has said he will be attending, investors will likely be looking for more details on:\n\nThe company announcing that its first semi trucks would be shipping to Pepsi in December. We noted a video a couple of days ago that showed a Tesla Semi broken down on a highway. \n\tAs we noted days ago, Tesla is dealing with increased scrutiny from the NHTSA, who is investigating a number of Autopilot-related accidents involving motorcycles that took place over the summer. The NHTSA is already in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Autopilot/Full Self Driving (updates may come via the company's 10-Q filing, instead of the conference call, if any less than stellar developments have occurred). \n\tThe status of the company's Shanghai plant, which was recently reported to be running under maximum capacity at the end of September. The plant will be running \"at about 93% of capacity through the end of year,\" Reuters reported in late September. The pace is despite the fact that the factory was recently upgraded to handle more production. The factory is capable of producing 14,000 Model Ys and 8,000 Model 3s per week. The company's target is 20,500 units a week for the rest of the year, the sources told Reuters. \n\tThe status of Germany, where Tesla has said that it is seeking to double vehicle sales in the country to 80,000 this year. \nThe call comes following Tesla's disappointing \"AI Day\", in which it revealed its \"Optimus\" humanoid robot. While the sell side might still be sticking with Musk, AI and robotics professionals had a different take on the company's robot reveal. \n\nAI researcher Filip Piekniewski called the robots \"next level cringe-worthy\" and a \"complete and utter scam\" on Twitter. It would be \"good to test falling, as this thing will be falling a lot,\" he said. \n\n\n\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. What they've shown was a lame robotic demo and they bragged about 'solving' what everyone in the field already 'solved' years ago, and didn't mention a word about any actual progress in solving the stuff nobody yet solved,\" he continued. \n\n\n\"Feels very 101. None of this is cutting edge,\" tweeted robotics expert Cynthia Yeung. \"Hire some PhDs and go to some robotics conferences Tesla.\"\n\nHere's where analysts stand into tonight's report:\n\nWedbush (outperform, PT $360)\n\tTesla’s 3Q deliveries came up short and its “likely logistics driven more than demand concerns”\n\t\t“Clearly Tesla had some delivery challenges in the quarter with some isolated soft spots in China”\n\t\n\tCannaccord (buy, PT $304)\n\tProduction was materially greater than deliveries, the largest difference over the last 15 quarters on absolute basis\n\t\tTrust Tesla’s explanation that the gap between production and deliveries is due to logistical issues related to end-of- the-quarter deliveries\n\t\n\tOppenheimer (outperform)\n\tTSLA 3Q22 deliveries missed expectations as the firm “transitioned to a new regional delivery system”\n\t\tThere might be some “incremental downward pressure on shares with these results” but would be “buyers on weakness”\n\t\n\tCowen (market perform, PT $244)\n\tThere could be early signs of a demand issue and will need to track monthly registrations and 4Q results “to better assess the situation”\n\t\tTSLA 3Q delivery figures missed estimates as more vehicles were in transit as production beats expectations\n\t\n\tMorgan Stanley (overweight, PT $383)\n\tIt is unlikely Tesla will compensate for the full-year shortfall fully in 4Q\n\t\t“Combined with a mostly non-event AI day, we’d expect shares to give back recent relative strength”\n\t\n\tJPMorgan (underweight, PT $153 from $137)\n\tWhile Tesla continues to point to supply constraints as limiting deliveries, the potential for demand destruction looms large given the price increases\n\t\n\n      Tyler Durden\nWed, 10/19/2022 - 14:21",

      "description": "Tesla slipped today following disclosure of another stock sale from CEO Elon Musk, with the shares now down nearly 49% year to date.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) slipped today following disclosure of another stock sale from CEO Elon Musk, with the shares now down nearly 49% year to date.\n\nIn a filing submitted with the SEC on Tuesday, Musk declared he sold around 19,500,000 shares over the course of three days in November, worth around $3.95 billion.\n\nThe latest sale comes only a few days after Musk closed his deal to buy Twitter on October 27, in a deal worth $44 billion.\n\nIt is unclear how much outside equity and personal money Musk has pledged for buying Twitter, though it is known $13 billion in debt financing was raised.\n\nThe latest Tesla sale from Musk this week follows two other disclosures that came after he announced his unsolicited bid to acquire Twitter on April 14.\n\nOn April 28, Musk declared in a filing that he sold around 9.7 million shares of Tesla worth around $8.35 billion. After Twitter sued Musk on July 12 to force him to complete the deal, Musk sold more shares on August 9, worth around $6.8 billion, claiming he needed to raise the funds in case he lost the lawsuit, and had to buy Twitter. Musk had previously said he wouldn't sell any more Tesla shares.\n\nFor analysts and investors, the latest share sale is unwelcome news, since Musk’s deal to buy Twitter (and ensuing stock sales, as well as the threat of more stock sales) has been an overhang on the stock.\n\n“Our fear heading into the final days of the deal was that Musk was going to be forced to sell more Tesla stock to fund the disaster Twitter deal and ultimately those fears came true which speaks to some of the massive selling pressures on the stock of late,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives said in a note published today.\n\nTesla’s stock performance has also been hit by factors like a potential slowdown in China, which Musk admitted may be in the middle of a slowdown, as well concerns over demand weakening in U.S., as well as larger macro concerns over the global economy. New competition from the likes of traditional automakers like Volkswagen, GM, and Ford threatens the strong EV lead Tesla has in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nFor Ives and investors, a focused Musk at the helm of Tesla is crucial right now during this uncertain time. Though Ives didn’t cut his rating or price target on Tesla, he was unequivocal in his displeasure, stating that the “Twitter madness needs to end now,” and Musk needs to focus more on Tesla, otherwise “investor frustration” would continue to build.\n\nAs for Musk’s Tesla holdings, according to his latest SEC filing he still owns over 445 million shares of Tesla, which is a 14% stake in the company. And although Musk is still the world's richest person, his personal fortune has sunk to $179.5 billion from a high of $340 billion following Tesla’s stock decline, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold about 22 million more shares in his electric vehicle business, which were worth around $3.6 billion, according to a financial filing out Wednesday night. The transactions took place between Monday and Wednesday this week according to the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk told his millions of followers on social media that he had \"no further TSLA sales planned\" after April 28.\n\nHowever, he continued to sell portions of his sizable holdings in Tesla after agreeing to buy Twitter in a deal worth around $44 billion. The acquisition closed in late October. Musk, who is also CEO of SpaceX, a major defense contractor, immediately appointed himself CEO of the social media company.\n\nAfter Musk's Twitter takeover, he told employees there that he sold Tesla shares to \"save\" their business.\n\nTesla shares have been declining this year, and sliding even further since he took on that new responsibility.\n\nShares of Tesla closed down 2.6% on Wednesday at $156.80, dropping the company's market capitalization to $495 billion. Tesla shares were down 55% year-to-date as of Wednesday's close.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",

      "description": "The fragile world stock market rally of the past week has been sideswiped by soaring bond yields, a pothole in the earnings season, Japan's plummeting yen and fresh chaos at the top of Britain's government.",
      "content": "Looking ahead to U.S. and global markets, here is Reuters' take:\n\n \n\n The fragile world stock market rally of the past week has been sideswiped by soaring bond yields, a pothole in the earnings season, Japan's plummeting yen and fresh chaos at the top of Britain's government.\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla threw a curve ball into an otherwise bright start to the third-quarter corporate earnings period and its stock dived almost 6% after the bell on Wednesday after it said it will miss its annual 2022 delivery target. Tesla futures (TSLA) were down 5% at 6:45 a.m. EST. The latest European tech sector earnings on Thursday were downbeat, too.\n\nBut soaring U.S. Treasury borrowing costs — where 3-, 10- and 30-year yields hit 15-, 14- and 11- year highs above 4% respectively — were an even bigger dampener.\n\nAsian and European stocks were lower on Thursday, with U.S. stock futures in the red.\n\nEven though some analysts clung to nods from the Federal Reserve that it might ease its rate rise campaign some time next year, the expected peak 'terminal' rate for the Fed's main policy rate has now closed in on 5%.\n\nUnsettled bond markets appeared to ignore the Fed's Beige Book of economic conditions that indicated inflation pressures may be easing at last. And they also seem to bypass a comment from Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari that his \"best guess\" was inflation pressures level off soon and allow the Fed to pause rate rises \"some time next year.\"\n\nYet as Treasury yields soared, the Bank of Japan on Thursday doubled down on its government bond yield cap - pushing the premium on U.S. Treasuries over JGBs ever wider and the sending the yen plummeting to 150 per dollar for the first time since 1990. Japanese policymakers' repeated threats of intervention to address excessive currency market volatility, but no action to stop the slide was seen so far.\n\nThe unfolding chaos at the top of UK government worsened, meantime. UK interior minister Suella Braverman quit late on Wednesday amid chaotic scenes within the ruling Conservative Party and mounting pressure on Prime Minister Liz Truss to stand down after less than two months in the job.\n\nEven though battered British bonds have recovered some of their footing from the disastrous mini-budget last month, the pound was on the wane again.

      "title": "Tesla stock sees worst year ever",
      "description": "Electric car maker closes 2022 down $700 billion having wiped out more than half of Elon Musk’s fortune",
      "content": "Tesla stock is set to close 2022 at a $700 billion loss since the start of January, marking the worst ever year for the world’s most valuable automaker.\n\nThe share price of the electric car firm crashed to its lowest level since August 2020 this week amid fears about production delays in China, as well as concerns that CEO Elon Musk has been distracted by his recent purchase of Twitter.\n\nThe losses leave the electric car maker’s market cap below $350 billion, having been valued above $1.23 trillion just over one year ago. To put this in context, this loss is more than the combined value of all other car makers globally.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, Tesla’s share price fell by more than $16, representing nearly $52 billion in market cap – more than Mr Musk paid for Twitter in October.\n\nThe extent of the capitulation has also pushed Tesla out of the top 10 most valuable companies, while also stripping Mr Musk of the title of world’s richest person due to the amount of equity he retains in the company.\n\nThe losses have even led some investors and market analysts to speculate that Mr Musk will be forced into a margin call.\n\n“Not much left before Elon gets margin called and the stock goes into a death spiral,” wrote US entrepreneur and investor William LeGate on Twitter. “Investors are scrambling to get out while they still can.”\n\nThe latest losses follow news that Tesla’s Shanghai factory will be forced to reduce production in 2023, having already slowed its output in 2022 due to Covid restrictions and lockdowns in China. Other bad news for the world’s biggest car manufacturer includes a new law in California that will ban Tesla from advertising its vehicles as ‘fully self-driving’.\n\n“Mr Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm,” Webush tech analyst Dan Ives wrote in his latest newsletter. “Instead Musk is laser-focused on Twitter which has been an ongoing nightmare that never ends for investors.”\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from Tesla.\n\nMr Musk, who has sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla share this year to finance his takeover of Twitter, claimed earlier this month that the losses could be attributed to external factors.\n\n“In simple terms: As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop,” he tweeted.\n\nTesla’s losses in 2022 are more than double that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is down roughly 34 per cent.",

      "summary": "\n\nThe share price of the electric car firm crashed to its lowest level since August 2020 this week amid fears about production delays in China, as well as concerns that CEO Elon Musk has been distracted by his recent purchase of Twitter. \n\nOn Tuesday alone, Tesla’s share price fell by more than $16, representing nearly $52 billion in market cap – more than Mr Musk paid for Twitter in October.\n\nThe extent of the capitulation has also pushed Tesla out of the top 10 most valuable companies, while also stripping Mr Musk of the title of world’s richest person due to the amount of equity he retains in the company.\n\nThe losses have even led some investors and market analysts to speculate that Mr Musk will be forced into a margin call.\n\n“Not much left before Elon gets margin called and the stock goes into a death spiral,” wrote US entrepreneur and investor William LeGate on Twitter. “Investors are scrambling to get out while they still can. Other bad news for the world’s biggest car manufacturer includes a new law in California that will ban Tesla from advertising its vehicles as ‘fully self-driving’.\n\n“Mr Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm,” Webush tech analyst Dan Ives wrote in his latest newsletter. “Instead Musk is laser-focused on Twitter which has been an ongoing nightmare that never ends for investors.” Mr Musk, who has sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla share this year to finance his takeover of Twitter, claimed earlier this month that the losses could be attributed to external factors.\n\n“In simple terms: As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop",

Tesla also recently announced that it will build a new regional service center in Fort Myers to assist its electric car customers in Collier, Lee and Charlotte counties, according to the News-Press.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, there were more than 60,000 light-duty electric vehicles registered in the Sunshine State, according to data from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. In a survey of electric vehicle owners that year, 26 percent of respondents were from the West Central region of Florida, which includes Sarasota and Manatee counties.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, there were just over 58,000 electric vehicles registered in Florida — the state with the second-highest amount, just behind California, which had 425,000 EVS registered, Inside EVs reported. That number appears to have increased since then, with nearly 96,000 EVs registered in Florida as of December 2021, the Herald-Tribune reported.\n\nIt’s a number that will likely just get bigger. Florida Power and Light has estimated that the number of electric vehicles in its service area could increase to nearly 600,000 by 2030, according to WUSF.",

      "content": "Oct 3 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq futures were pulled lower on Monday by a fall in Tesla shares after the electric vehicle-maker failed to meet quarterly delivery targets, although the other two main indexes were headed for a positive start to the quarter.\n\nAt 06:14 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 100 points, or 0.35%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 5.5 points, or 0.15%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 24.5 points, or 0.22%.\n\nTesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell more than 4% in premarket trade, as logistical challenges overshadowed its record vehicle deliveries, which were announced on Sunday. read more\n\nWeakness in Tesla spilled over to its other rate-sensitive peers including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), both of which were down 0.4% each.\n\nAll three major indexes ended a volatile third quarter lower on Friday as growing fears that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy will tip the economy into recession weighed on investor sentiment.\n\n\"Looking ahead, October brings earnings, with Q3 estimates already declining 7%, and the whisper numbers a bit more than that,\" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\n\"The larger concern (than the actual numbers for Q3, when consumers were still spending) is the guidance for Q4, as consumers have pulled back, inflation continues and the Fed's 'adjustments' will have a more substantial impact.\"\n\nFurther, global factory output mostly weakened in September as slowing demand added to the pain from persistent cost pressures and tighter monetary policy, diminishing economic recovery prospects. read more\n\nThe focus will be on ISM manufacturing index data for September at 10 a.m. ET, at a time when the world's largest economy is grappling with overshooting price pressures.\n\nCredit Suisse trimmed its year-end 2022 target for (.SPX) by about 10% to 3,850 points, as corporate earnings take a hit from slowing economic growth.\n\nIt has also set a 2023 year-end price target for the benchmark index at 4,050 points, adding that 2023 would be a \"year of weak, non-recessionary growth and falling inflation.\"\n\nReporting by Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva",

The company also laid off 6% of its workforce and saw a slew of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company artificially inflated its share price and underpriced its cars.\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, the company saw a 47% increase in car deliveries in its third quarter compared to its second quarter.\n\nHowever, analyst estimates show Rivian registered more than $3 billion in losses during the first half of 2022, Markets Insider reported.",

      "content": "A Tesla model 3 car is seen in their showroom in Singapore October 22, 2021. REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nA look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.\n\nThe fragile world stock market rally of the past week has been sideswiped by soaring bond yields, a pothole in the earnings season, Japan's plummeting yen and fresh chaos at the top of Britain's government.\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA.O) threw a curve ball into an otherwise bright start to the third-quarter corporate earnings period and its stock dived almost 6% after the bell on Wednesday after it said it will miss its annual 2022 delivery target. read more The latest European tech sector earnings on Thursday were downbeat, too. read more\n\nBut soaring U.S. Treasury borrowing costs -- where 3-, 10- and 30-year yields hit 15-, 14- and 11- year highs above 4% respectively -- were an even bigger dampener.\n\nAsian and European stocks were lower on Thursday, with U.S. stock futures in the red.\n\nEven though some analysts clung to nods from the Federal Reserve that it might ease its rate rise campaign some time next year, the expected peak 'terminal' rate for the Fed's main policy rate has now closed in on 5%.\n\nUnsettled bond markets appeared to ignore the Fed's Beige Book of economic conditions that indicated inflation pressures may be easing at last. And they also seem to bypass a comment from Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari that his \"best guess\" was inflation pressures level off soon and allow the Fed to pause rate rises \"some time next year.\" read more read more\n\nYet as Treasury yields soared, the Bank of Japan on Thursday doubled down on its government bond yield cap - pushing the premium on U.S. Treasuries over JGBs ever wider and the sending the yen plummeting to 150 per dollar for the first time since 1990. Japanese policymakers' repeated threats of intervention to address excessive currency market volatility, but no action to stop the slide was seen so far. read more\n\nThe unfolding chaos at the top of UK government worsened, meantime. UK interior minister Suella Braverman quit late on Wednesday amid chaotic scenes within the ruling Conservative Party and mounting pressure on Prime Minister Liz Truss to stand down after less than 2 months in the job. read more\n\nEven though battered British bonds have recovered some of their footing from the disastrous mini-budget last month, the pound was on the wane again. Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the BoE would respond to changes in Truss's tax and spending policies. \"Whether official interest rates have to rise by quite as much as currently priced in financial markets remains to be seen,\" he said. read more\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n\n* U.S. Oct Philadelphia business index. U.S. Sept existing home sales, U.S. weekly jobless claims\n\n* U.S. corp earnings: American Airlines, AT&T, Dow, Danaher, Whirlpool, CSX, Union Pacific, Marsh & McLennan, Nucor, Fifth Third Bancorp, SVP Financial, Dover, Pool, Quest Diagnostics, Freeport-McMoRan, Tractor Supply, Genuine Parts, Robert Half\n\n* European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks in Frankfurt, Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernández de Cos speaks in Madrid",

      "content": "LONDON (AP) — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nBMW investing $1.7B in S Carolina as automaker shifts to EVs\n\nGREER, S.C. (AP) — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nStocks lose ground as more earnings roll in; yields rise\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nTesla 3Q profit more than doubles from a year ago to $3.29B\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nUS awards $2.8B in grants for EV batteries in 12 states\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 24.82 points, or 0.7%, to 3,695.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 99.99 points, or 0.3%, to 30,423.81. The Nasdaq fell 91.89 points, or 0.9%, to 10,680.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies shed 30.20 points, or 1.7%, to 1,725.76.",

The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007.

The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nUS awards $2.8B in grants for EV batteries in 12 states\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 24.82 points, or 0.7%, to 3,695.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 99.99 points, or 0.3%, to 30,423.81. The Nasdaq fell 91.89 points, or 0.9%, to 10,680.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies shed 30.20 points, or 1.7%, to 1,725.76.",

      "content": "LONDON — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nGREER, S.C. — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nNEW YORK — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nDETROIT — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.",

      "content": "LONDON (AP) — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nBMW investing $1.7B in S Carolina as automaker shifts to EVs\n\nGREER, S.C. (AP) — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nStocks lose ground as more earnings roll in; yields rise\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nTesla 3Q profit more than doubles from a year ago to $3.29B\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nUS awards $2.8B in grants for EV batteries in 12 states\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing.

It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build.

Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators.

      "content": "Tesla recalled more than 350,000 vehicles from U.S. customers over the weekend in two separate campaigns.\n\nThe automaker said Saturday that it was recalling more than 321,000 vehicles over a software glitch that disables the tail lights on some cars. The recall covers 2023 Model 3 sedans, as well as Model Y crossovers for model years 2020 through 2023.\n\nTesla estimated that the problem affects 1% of the vehicles under recall and said it will release a software update to address the “firmware anomaly.” Vehicles in production received the update starting November 6, according to a filing with the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nOn Friday, Tesla recalled 30,000 Model X SUVs due to a problem with the front passenger airbag.\n\nThe EV maker has issued 19 recalls in the U.S. so far this year, according to data from the DOT. The vast majority of those have been resolved with an over-the-air software update. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled more than 40,000 Model X and Model S sedans over a software issue that could affect power steering when driving over potholes, and another 53 vehicles due to faulty installation of side view mirrors.\n\nIn August, consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recall Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) technology from its vehicles, calling it “one of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades.”",

      "title": "Tesla Is Down Bad Right Now",
      "description": "The company has lost more than $500 billion off its market cap since Elon Musk announced his Twitter purchase.",
      "content": "Elon Musk’s debt-laden purchase of Twitter has been a bit of a mess — good for users who enjoy the chaos of a tanking platform, bad for the advertisers underwriting the thing and the thousands of its employees forced out by layoffs or absurd working conditions. But if you think Musk’s biggest current problems lie in getting the blue bird under his control, you’re forgetting about the scale of his chief business.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April. A few weeks before the purchase, his electric-car company, Tesla, had a market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion. After a stock sell-off this week, one of many since the spring, Tesla is now valued at $527 billion. Because Musk owns roughly a quarter of the company, he has now lost $101 billion of his net worth this year alone. For those keeping score, that’s the value of more than two Twitter purchases. If the stock price keeps plummeting, Musk could soon lose his status as the world’s richest man.\n\nWhy is Tesla down so bad? One reason may be that traders fear Musk is too distracted by all the “dumb things” he promises to do at Twitter to effectively run a company with a higher market cap than Exxon Mobil. There’s the crummy market, of course. But there are also more tangible problems: Supply costs are up because of now-familiar problems, like supply-chain backups and China’s zero-COVID policy. Sales have been falling short of estimates because of inflation and rising interest rates bearing down on consumers. And Tesla’s lucrative sale of regulatory credits is also down, as other car companies break into the market.\n\nThen there are the recalls. This week, Tesla announced a recall of 321,000 Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs, owing to tail lights that “intermittently illuminate.” In plainer language, they go off when they’re not supposed to. That comes on the heels of another recall involving 30,000 Model X luxury sedans, whose passenger airbags had the potential to deploy in minor collisions, when they weren’t supposed to. Now, those aren’t killers on their own: Both can be solved fairly easily by software patches. But there have been 17 other recalls this year — a concerning record for a company that is requesting takedowns of videos showing Teslas running over child mannequins.\n\nMoving forward, Tesla could also take a hit if fit fails to meet its manufacturing targets for this year. Musk promised Tesla would build 1.5 million cars in 2022, but as of the end of the third quarter, it had built only 929,910. It will need to finish 570,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, at a rate of more than 6,300 per day, or risk another stock dive.\n\nA company losing more than half its valuation within a calendar year is pretty rough. But Tesla has a major debut coming up on December 1, when it delivers its long-awaited Semi model, selling the first round of the tractor-trailers to Pepsi. The first-ever electric long-haul truck, with a 500-mile range, could be a major boost for the company — assuming everything goes right this time.",

The slump is painful for a broad swath of investors: The company is the sixth-biggest member of the S&P 500 Index as of Wednesday’s close. It’s been the third-largest drag this year on the benchmark, which Tesla joined two years ago next week.\n\nTesla shares have been battered by angst over a potential recession and the Federal Reserve’s move to hike interest rates, which have prompted investors to dump risky and expensive stocks, sparking an intense selloff in technology and growth assets in particular.\n\nOn top of that, the company’s own troubles, including supply shortages, soaring raw material costs and production disruptions, as well as Elon Musk’s preoccupation with turning around newly acquired Twitter Inc., have all weighed heavily on the stock. Musk has been dethroned as the world’s richest person because of the slide.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook for next year is darkening as well. On Wednesday, at least two Wall Street analysts struck a cautious note on Tesla and the electric-vehicle sector overall. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered estimates to reflect “softer” supply and demand, while Morgan Stanley warned that the brakes were “screeching on electric vehicle demand,” and cut its projections for adoption in the US.\n\nWhile Tesla shares have largely been sliding the whole year, the drop has intensified in the past couple months, with the stock falling 41% since the end of September. The broader S&P 500 Index has advanced 11% in the same period, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 gained 7%.\n• None AmEx Hooked Big Spenders and Regained the Throne With a Pricier Platinum Card\n• None TikTok’s Problem Child Has 7 Million Followers and One Proud Mom\n• None The FUD Behind the Crypto Collapse",

      "description": "More than 20 tornadoes struck Louisiana within 24 hours on Wednesday, killing three and injuring at least six.",
      "content": "A Tesla's camera captured footage from inside a tornado that struck Louisiana, killing at least three and toppling over a semi-truck.\n\nA Tesla sitting outside a Gretna home captured the moment an EF-2 hit the town close to New Orleans, with strong winds and heavy rainfall.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the cameras become obscured by the circular wind and several angles show a flash of lights and debris as the tornado rolled through. The once clean roadway became littered with broken wood and the truck across the street turned over.\n\nOverhead footage, captured by Fox 8 Live, showed the house across the street with its roof entirely ripped off, leaving behind a mess of debris. The home next to it also appears to have it's roof ripped off, but the surrounding homes were left with minimal damage.\n\nA total of 21 tornados hit the state within 24 hours on Wednesday, and at least six were injured and three people are dead following the twisters. A grandmother, Allison Alexander, 56, lost her life when a tornado ripped through her home.\n\nThe deadly twister struck Killona and tore apart her mobile home, Nola.com reported. Alexander's body was found under a pile of debris in her neighbor's driveway with serious head injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nAlexander's grandsons, four and nine, and her sister Yvette Raymond, 53, were also injured during the twister. The nine-year-old suffered a broken leg and was hospitalized.\n\nHer other family members - a 10-year-old grandson, two other boys, and a male friend - were also inside the home during the event, but were not injured.\n\nThe only part of Alexander's home left standing was the metal frame the mobile home sat on.\n\nHer family and friends remembered her as a positive soul that could talk to just about anyone.\n\n'I'd say: \"You know that person?\" And she'd say: \"No, I just met them.\"' her niece Ashanty Raymond, 27, told Nola.com.\n\nHer neighbor Anthony White, 44, remembered her as being 'so nice.' He said: 'She always had a smile on her face.'\n\nThe grandmother was born and raised in Killona and was the second oldest of six children, Nola.com reported.\n\nShe worked as a hair stylist at her niece's salon and was known as Tee Tanka to friends.\n\n'She had a bright aura about her. She never had a bad day,' her daughter Keonsha Alexander, 27, told Nola.com.\n\nHer sister Yvette said Alexander 'would do anything for anyone,' despite having limited means herself.\n\nThe family set up a GoFundMe page to help rehabilitate after the tragedy. It has raised more than $5,000 of its $20,000 goal, as of Friday morning.",

      "title": "Watch Musk Offloads More Tesla Shares",
      "description": "Bloomberg's Bailey Lipschultz joins Caroline Hyde to discuss Elon Musk offloading another $3.6 billion of Tesla shares, after he said he was done getting rid of Tesla stock. (Source: Bloomberg)",
      "content": "It's interesting media course. We were just wondering why it was under pressure. Many feeling perhaps the retail investor, which is such an important buyer for Tesla, was a little bit worried about his destruction, about his recent other purchases. But now it seems we made clear that maybe the selling pressure is coming from him himself. Exactly. When you look at where the market was trading Monday and Tuesday, broadly moving higher and Tesla, the biggest drag on the S & P 500 and NASDAQ 100 in those two days. Again, this is kind of a bit of sounding an alarm for investors. It's still those concerns about what is you on focused on, where is it headed? Obviously, Space X has been successful. Tesla has been a roaring success. But did he bite off more than he could chew with with Twitter in particular, again, with massive debt loads? How does that impact the fundamental business of Tesla? Again, given how large of a stake he has in whether or not he's going to continue to sell shares, as you mentioned at the top of the hour that he did say earlier in the year that he was done selling and then three and half billion is not done selling. What's so interesting, we're just talking with Katie about a real macro feel to these markets, the fact that the Federal Reserve often is the only game in town. Now, you know, Musk himself can be a bit of a macroeconomic commentator. And he sort of made a few, shall we say, trails breadcrumbs for us, saying, look, you should be worried about debt right now. If you're seeing the rates go up from the Fed, we're not his debt. We're not Twitter's debt. Well, that's the thing. And that's kind of to your point. Interest rates are going higher. When you look at Twitter, when you look at that take out, that does come with massive debt load. That does come with pretty high interest rates that are going to continue to need to be paid. So that's the main question is, is Iran selling these shares to buy some of that debt? Is he doing it to invest more in Twitter? Is he doing that to, you know, help cover some of those interest payments? No one really knows that. I don't think anyone really kind of understands what he was doing other than Elan. But there are so many questions just given how tied these companies can be, given where they are right now and where they're trading. And again, with this selling pressure that we've seen so far this week for Tesla stock in particular.",

      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) closed the most recent trading day at $123.18, moving +1.12% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.25%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.91%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the electric car maker had lost 37.43% over the past month, lagging the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 17.03% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.59% in that time.\n\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from Tesla as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Tesla to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 40%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $25.23 billion, up 42.39% from the year-ago period.\n\nTSLA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.07 per share and revenue of $82.5 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +80.09% and +53.29%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.28% higher. Tesla is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Tesla is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 29.96. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.09, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, TSLA's PEG ratio is currently 0.95. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Automotive - Domestic stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.08 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 153, putting it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Should Investors Buy the Recent Dip in Tesla (TSLA) Stock?",
      "description": "With TSLA 52% from its highs, investors may be contemplating adding Tesla shares to their portfolio. Let's take a look at the company's outlook and valuation to see if it is indeed a good time to buy TSLA.",
      "content": "Tesla TSLA shares saw a nice rally Thursday after better than expected CPI numbers gave the broader market a nice boost. TSLA stock recently hit a new 52-week low of $177.12 per share as Elon Musk liquidated more Tesla shares following his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWith TSLA 52% from its highs, investors may be contemplating adding Tesla shares to their portfolio. Let’s take a look at the company’s outlook and valuation to see if it is indeed a good time to buy TSLA.\n\nTesla reported its Q3 earnings last month and beat EPS expectations by 10% at $1.05 per share. The stock dropped despite the beat on the company’s bottom line. Top line growth was underwhelming, with sales missing expectations by 4% on revenue of $21.45 billion. Despite a record 343,830 deliveries during the quarter this slightly missed expectations as well.\n\nTSLA stock is down -46% YTD to underperform the S&P 500’s -22%. Tesla shares are still up 721% over the last three years to crush the benchmark and its peer group’s +7%.\n\nHowever, the company’s outlook is becoming more important with investors coming away less impressed with Tesla’s growth following its Q3 release. Tesla shares are still roughly down 14% since the report, even with its bounce Thursday.\n\nYear over year, TSLA earnings are now expected to rise 79% to $4.05. Fiscal year 2023 earnings are expected to rise another 30% at $5.29 per share. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to climb 54% this year and another 39% in FY23 at $115.38 billion. This is more than quadruple pre-pandemic sales of $24.57 billion in 2019.\n\nEarnings estimate revisions for this year and FY23 have trended up over the last 90 days. Rising estimate revisions are a good sign, especially with investors concerned over the premium paid for TSLA shares following its Q3 report.\n\nTrading around $190 per share, TSLA has a P/E of 43.8X. This is well above the industry average of 12.2X, which is where the premium may be a factor. However, Tesla remains the industry leader in the EV market and trades much lower than its decade high of 45,336X and the median of 236.9X. Also, industry peers like General Motors GM and Ford F are at far different stages of corporate life and aren’t experiencing growth like TSLA.\n\nTesla’s price to sales is becoming more reasonable again as shown in the chart above. TSLA’s P/S of 8.2X is much lower than its decade high of 31.3X and near the median of 7.9X.\n\nTSLA still lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its Automotive-Domestic Industry now in the top 27% of over 250 Zacks Industries. While there could be better buying opportunities ahead, Tesla continues to trade at a far better valuation than it has in the past. Also, electric vehicles are still a relatively small part of the auto industry market and the space still has massive potential to grow.\n\nTSLA still appears poised for growth and earnings estimate revisions are up from last quarter. Patient investors could be rewarded for holding the stock with the average Zacks Price Target suggesting 66% upside from current levels.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know",
      "description": "Tesla (TSLA) closed the most recent trading day at $157.67, moving +0.55% from the previous trading session.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) closed at $157.67 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.55% move from the prior day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 2.49%. At the same time, the Dow lost 2.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the electric car maker had lost 16.11% over the past month, lagging the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 8.04% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.14% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be hoping for strength from Tesla as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.20, up 41.18% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $25.45 billion, up 43.64% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.05 per share and revenue of $82.83 billion. These totals would mark changes of +79.2% and +53.9%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.37% lower. Tesla is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Tesla's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 38.68. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.36, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nInvestors should also note that TSLA has a PEG ratio of 1.23 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Automotive - Domestic industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.25 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 64, which puts it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "description": "In the latest trading session, Tesla (TSLA) closed at $137.57, marking a -0.17% move from the previous day.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) closed at $137.57 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.17% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.49%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.06%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the electric car maker had lost 18.9% over the past month. This has lagged the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 13.13% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.49% in that time.\n\nTesla will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.20, up 41.18% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $25.45 billion, up 43.64% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.05 per share and revenue of $82.83 billion. These totals would mark changes of +79.2% and +53.9%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.37% lower. Tesla is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Tesla has a Forward P/E ratio of 33.99 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.19, so we one might conclude that Tesla is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.08. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Automotive - Domestic stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.15 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, which puts it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Now -40% in a Month; Case-Shiller In Depth",
      "description": "The world's EV leader is now on pace for its worst month, quarter and full year ever.",
      "content": "Market indices closed Tuesday off their session lows, but it was another lackluster trading day across the board, with only the blue-chip Dow barely in positive territory, +0.11%. The S&P 500 lost -0.40% on the day, the Nasdaq fared the worst of the major indices, -1.38%, and the Russell 2000 was -0.61%. Reopening news from China was initially met with optimism, but this seems to have tempered over the course of the day.\n\n\n\nWhat looks like its taking the lion’s share of losses out of the tech-heavy Nasdaq is the much beleaguered Tesla TSLA, which hemorrhaged another -11.4% in the session and is now trading at a fresh 52-week low. The world’s EV leader is now on pace for its worst month, quarter and full year ever. It’s riding a seven-day losing streak and has now lost -68% year to date, -72% from its all-time high just 13 months ago.\n\n\n\nIt’s gotten so bad for the now-Austin, TX-based automaker that even the seasonal low-volume trading for most of the market isn’t helping: 200 million Tesla shares were traded just today alone. Shares are now beneath $110; a year ago they were up near $400 per share. And Tesla has lost -40% of its value in just the past month alone, when CEO Elon Musk started tinkering with his new toy, Twitter.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Musk does have a grand plan for turning Twitter around, but he’s not convincing many people — even some of his loyal supporters, of which he has had many. This is the man, after all, who built Tesla into a formidable car manufacturer that has now pushed other automakers into their own line of EVs, and has gotten SpaceX off the ground (pun definitely intended). But what looks like the main move now is for Musk to find a new CEO to look after his social media platform and return to stop the bleeding on the company that made him a household name in the first place.\n\n\n\nCase-Shiller Recap, In Depth\n\n\n\nA half hour before today’s opening bell, “new” Case-Shiller Home Price Index data came out for October, to +9.2% for the month from the +10.7% the previous month. We’re now at levels not seen since March of this year, and well off the June peak, by -4.6%. All cities in both the 10-city and 20-city surveys saw lower price increases month over month.\n\n\n\nThe 10-city came in +8.0% year over year, but down 160 bps month on month. The 20-city reached +8.6%, down nearly 2% from the +10.4% reported for September. As in other monthly housing figures we’ve seen recently, it’s clear interest rate policy has helped roll back housing prices, at least from peak highs mid-year, with the trajectory continuing to point the same direction.\n\n\n\nAs with the past couple Case-Shiller reports, Miami and Tampa Bay led the way in home price growth, +21% and 20.5%, respectively. Charlotte was third place, +15.0%, followed by Atlanta at +14.9% and Dallas +13.5%. Obviously, the Southeast and the South were by far the strongest sectors, +17.9% and +17.0%, respectively. The worst-performing cities, San Francisco (+0.6%) and Seattle (+4.5%), are both -10% from their peak in May of this year.\n\n\n\nNovember Pending Home Sales will be released tomorrow morning, adding to the housing market narrative. Expectations are for losses to tighten from the previous month. Other than that, weekly jobless claims and Chicago PMI are the only economic reports hitting the tape for the rest of the week. We may see some tax-related equity reshuffling before the markets put a wrap on 2022 1pm ET Friday, but other than that, we’re pretty quiet.\n\n\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

      "description": "Tesla (TSLA) witnessed a jump in share price last session on above-average trading volume. The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions for the stock doesn't suggest further strength down the road.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares soared 8.1% in the last trading session to close at $121.82. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 42.1% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nShares of Tesla were up for the second straight day yesterday, after a seven-session losing streak. The electric vehicle (EV) leader has been witnessing massive sell-off lately and is the most oversold that it has ever been. There has been no specific news/development, which could account for the recent price surge. So, this might just be a brief respite and could be part of a late Santa Claus rally. Given the rising economic uncertainty, growing angst over Musk’s Twitter focus and fresh production challenges in China amid soaring COVID-19 cases, we don’t expect the rally to have legs.\n\nThis electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%. Revenues are expected to be $25.23 billion, up 42.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on TSLA going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Another stock from the same industry, Harley-Davidson (HOG), closed the last trading session 1.8% higher at $41. Over the past month, HOG has returned -14.5%.\n\nFor Harley-Davidson , the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed +110% over the past month to $0.03. This represents a change of -78.6% from what the company reported a year ago. Harley-Davidson currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
      "description": "Zacks users have recently been watching Tesla (TSLA) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned -31.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 23.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of +40% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 points to a change of +78.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.21 indicates a change of +29% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tesla.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +43.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $82.83 billion and $114.27 billion estimates indicate +53.9% and +38% changes, respectively.\n\nTesla reported revenues of $21.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56%. EPS of $1.05 for the same period compares with $0.62 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.89%. The EPS surprise was +10.53%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It’s also down twice as much as Nasdaq. By comparison, Ford (FORD) is down 45%, and General Motors (GM) has declined by 43%.\n\n \n\n Tesla is continuing a week-long manufacturing halt at its Shanghai gigfactory in China, for a total of 17 days, as COVID cases there continue to rise.\n\n \n\n Last week, Tesla expanded discounts in North America for Model 3 and Model Y EVs—price breaks that come on the heels of discounts that Tesla offered to customers in China earlier this fall.\n\n \n\n Meanwhile, Musk has continued to sell large chunks of his Tesla stock, including 22 million more shares worth $3.6 billion in mid-December.\n\n \n\n As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, Tesla was trading at $112.25.\n\n \n\n Craig Irwin, a Roth Capital analyst, who has a hold rating on the stock an a $85 price target, echoed the sentiment of many Tesla watchers in saying, “I think he (Elon Musk) really needs to focus on operations, focus on giving us great cars.”\n\n \n\n Since becoming Twitter CEO on Oct. 28, 10 releases of internal documents, dubbed the “Twitter files,” have shown how the social media behemoth, under former CEO Jack Dorsey, cooperated with various agencies of the U.S. government, not least of which being the FBI, to shape public opinion on political, electoral and health issues, including COVID-19.\n\n \n\n Musk has also stirred Twitter controversy among mainstream media and liberals by welcoming back previously banned users, including former President Donald Trump.\n\n \n\n Many big advertisers have paused or suspended their advertising on the platform, which continues to bleed cash despite Musk laying off about half of the staff shortly after assuming control.",

      "description": "TSLA Makes 3,000,000th Car After 10 Years, 1,000,000 More Coming In The Second Half",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is firing on all cylinders and its growth phase is only getting started. Shares are about to race much higher.\n\nElon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive tweeted in August that the electric car company has now made over three million vehicles, up from only 3,000 a decade ago. The manufacturing growth is remarkable.\n\nThe bull case for Tesla has always been a leap of faith. Even with its heady manufacturing growth, the Austin, Tex.-based company is a tiny player in terms of total vehicles made. Toyota (TM) built 10 million vehicles during 2021 alone, and that was in the midst of a parts shortage.\n\nDespite this, at a market capitalization of $904 billion, Tesla shares fetch Two-times greater than the combined value of Ford (F) ($63.6B), General Motors (GM) ($56B), Stellantis N.V. (STLA) ($48.5B), and Toyota ($259.6B).\n\nThe California New Car Dealers Association announced in August that Tesla produced the two top-selling vehicles in the state during the first half of 2022. This is a huge development. Its electric vehicles, the Model Y and Model 3, are more popular than long-time internal combustion engine best sellers like Toyota Rav4, Camry, and Corolla.\n\nTesla Model Y commands 54.2% market share in the luxury compact sport utility vehicle marketplace. The 42,320 units were sold in the first half compared to 7,856 Mercedes GLC-Class, the runner up. The comparable BMW, Audi and Lexus rounded out the top five, each having sold less than 5,500 units.\n\nAmong luxury sedans Model 3 took 60.8% market share over Lexus and BMW. Even the Tesla Model S bested its BMW, Mercedes, and Chevy Corvette comparables in the luxury and high-end sports car category, according to a report at Electrek.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss this data as a California thing. The state is notoriously green. It is also the biggest and most important car market in the United States. All carmakers compete there, and trends that start in California necessarily sweep across the country because automobile companies are reluctant to build two sets of vehicles.\n\nTesla’s growth is not limited to California.\n\nThe company has become a major player in China, where its Shanghai factory celebrated this week the manufacture of its 1,000,000th vehicle, according to the Musk tweet. That factory began production in 2019 and today is considered to be the most advanced facility in the world.\n\nBloomberg noted that recent upgrades put the factory on pace to produce 21,000 cars and SUVs weekly, more than 1,000,000 units annually.\n\nAnd Tesla has next generation factories coming on stream in Austin, Texas; and near Berlin in Germany. Those facilities will use so-called giga castings to shrink complexity. The massive rear casting reduces the number of pieces of sheet metal from 171 to 2 pieces of aluminum, while eliminating 1,700 welds. Musk says that casting can be optimized even further.\n\nThese are real competitive advantages that allow Tesla to build EVs faster and more efficiently. High average selling prices are maintaining profits margins. Tesla recently posted 26.5% profit margins, about 1,400 basis points higher than the industry average.\n\nHigh prices are having no impact on demand.\n\nDrive Tesla Canada reported Friday that Tesla has officially stopped taking new orders in the United States and Canada for the Model 3 Long Range, due to overwhelming demand. The new order configuration page now states flatly that the product is unavailable until 2023.\n\nInvestors should see the bigger picture, though. Tesla is in the poll position in the race to EVs, the future of the sector.\n\nAnalysts at Alix Partners expect EV sales to rise to 28% by 2028, up from the current level of only 3%. By 2025 the same analysts see the EV segment reaching 59%. In Europe market share during the same time frame is expected to jump to 44%, and 83%, respectively.\n\nSafety is for suckers.

      "content": "Tesla shares have suffered a massive drop in recent months, with noted Tesla analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities stating this week that CEO Elon Musk is viewed as “asleep at the wheel” from a leadership perspective.\n\nThe Street reports that on Tuesday, Tesla’s shares reached their lowest point in over two years, continuing a downward trend in the company’s worst annual performance to date. This follows news that Tesla has temporarily stopped production at its Shanghai plant due to declining demand in the world’s largest automotive market.\n\nAccording to Reuters, production at Tesla’s Shanghai plant has been suspended during the final week of the year, affecting the production of the Model Y sedan. This temporary shutdown is expected to result in a reduction of sedan production by approximately 30% compared to November.\n\nThis marks the first time that Tesla has intentionally reduced production levels at its Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018. While production at the plant has been temporarily impacted by both coronavirus-related restrictions and scheduled maintenance in the past, this is the first instance of voluntary reduction in output.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives commented: “With China the core linchpin to the Tesla bull thesis, worries are growing around what the softening demand picture looks like for 2023 given the dark macro clouds and increasing domestic EV competition.” Ives also reduced his fourth-quarter delivery targets for Tesla from 450,000 to 410,000.\n\nIves discussed the current view of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, writing: “At the same time that Tesla is cutting prices and inventory is starting to build globally in face of a likely global recession, (CEO Elon) Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla’s shares experienced a decline of 11.05 percent and were trading at $109.53 per share, the lowest point since August 2020. This drop extends the stock’s overall decline in 2022 to approximately 72.6 percent.\n\nA considerable portion of Tesla’s decline in 2022 happened in April, when Musk announced his intention to purchase Twitter. Musk contested the deal, but it was ultimately approved shortly before a hearing in Delaware Chancery and valued the social media company at $44 billion.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Musk borrowed approximately $13 billion from a banking group for the Twitter acquisition, including $3 billion in unsecured debt with an annual interest rate of 11.75 percent. The remaining portion of the debt consisted of $6.5 billion in term loans and $3 billion in secured bonds.\n\nTwitter is reportedly losing a significant amount of money, and Musk has been selling large amounts of Tesla stock. In mid-December, filings showed that Elon Musk sold approximately 22 million shares of Tesla, worth around $3.6 billion, despite stating earlier in the year that he had “no further TSLA sales planned” after April 28.\n\nRead more at the Street here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

      "title": "Tesla: Bull vs. Bear Case",
      "description": "Tesla's stock has been a battleground for years. Bears have won the battle recently amid stock sales from Tesla's controversial CEO. Can bulls regain control?",
      "content": "If you follow markets, it should be no secret that Tesla TSLA stock rapidly declined over the past year. While the S&P 500 Index is down 18.2%, shares of Tesla are down a whopping 63.6%.\n\nWhat has led to the downfall?\n\n· Macroeconomic Conditions: Electric vehicles are a want rather than a need. While EVs have drastically come down in price since Tesla launched the Model 3, most traditional internal combustion engine-powered automobiles are more affordable. In other words, when the consumer is crushed by inflation, debt, and higher unemployment, purchasing an EV becomes less attainable.\n\n· Tax Selling:As the year ends, investors are taking inventory of the portfolio and are tax harvesting losing positions. In recent weeks, tax harvesting may have snowballed the selling behind shares in Tesla shares as many institutional investors and retail investors are stuck in underwater positions. As a result, active ETFs such as the Arkk Innovation ETF ARKK may be forced to sell shares at some point.\n\n· Concerns Over Management: It’s hard to argue with CEO Elon Musk’s business prowess. The controversial CEO is the mastermind behind Paypal PYPL, SpaceX, and several other successful ventures which propelled him to be one of the wealthiest humans ever to exist. Nevertheless, his actions and words in recent months have spooked investors. First, Musk acquired Twitter. In acquiring Twitter, shareholder concern about Musk’s time allocation began to increase. While Musk is known to juggle several ventures at once, the Twitter acquisition is his most immense undertaking yet. Second, Elon has been selling shares to pay for the Twitter acquisition. Insider selling is never looked at as a positive by shareholders. Lastly, the billionaire CEO has warned the public consistently about the potential for a “hard landing” caused by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.\n\nWhat do bulls have to hang their hats on?\n\n· Potential Capitulation Volume: Thursday, Tesla traded a whopping 205 million shares. The last time Tesla stock traded that many shares was in the middle of the Covid panic in March 2021.\n\n· Deeply Oversold Levels: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator that analysts use to measure a stock’s current and historical strength or weakness using closing prices over a recent trading period. Since its inception, TSLA has only had a more oversold reading than today in 2019. After the instance in 2019, shares multiplied twentyfold.\n\nPictured: Max chart of TSLA. The bottom shows historical RSI overlayled on the chart.\n\n· Stopping the Bleeding:Thursday, Elon Musk tried to instill investor confidence by saying that he will “not sell shares of TSLA stock until 2024 or 2025.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "When thinking of exciting investments, Tesla TSLA shares undoubtedly jump to the forefront of many minds. After all, it’s easy to understand why, as the company has entirely changed the way we see the automotive industry.\n\nAnd it goes without saying that TSLA shares have rewarded investors handsomely over the last decade, up more than a mind-boggling 6000%.\n\nHowever, over the last month, TSLA shares have significantly lagged behind the general market, down more than 15% vs. the S&P 500’s marginal 0.6% gain.\n\nWith shares deep in the red year-to-date, it raises a valid question: how does the company currently stack up? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nDespite the recent poor share performance, Tesla has consistently delivered better-than-expected bottom-line results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 10% in its latest print.\n\nIn fact, Tesla has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven consecutive quarters, all by double-digit percentages.\n\nStill, revenue results have come in under expectations as of late, with the company penciling in back-to-back revenue misses. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.\n\nDespite a hawkish Fed and rising logistical costs playing spoilsport for the company, Tesla still boasts an impressive growth profile; earnings are forecasted to soar nearly 80% Y/Y in FY22 and a further 30% in FY23.\n\nThe projected growth in earnings comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 54% in FY22 and 38% in FY23.\n\nIt’s no secret that Tesla shares are pricey, currently trading at a 6.1X forward price-to-sales ratio. Still, on a relative basis, the value is beneath its 6.5X five-year median value and highs of 23.9X in 2021.\n\nTSLA carries a Style Score of a “D” for Value.\n\nTesla TSLA shares have displayed a high level of weakness relative to the general market over the last month, indicating that sellers have taken a tight grip.\n\nStill, despite the poor share performance, Tesla has managed to post strong bottom-line results, chaining together a nice streak of positive EPS surprises that are all in the double-digit percentage range.\n\nIn addition, investors will have to fork up a hefty premium for the company’s shares, typical within stocks with high-growth profiles.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Tesla denies report of China production cut as deliveries hit new monthly record",
      "description": "For Tesla (TSLA) in China, there's a bit of good news and some potential bad news.",
      "content": "For Tesla (TSLA) in China, there's a bit of good news and some potential bad news.\n\nAccording to Tesla China through news agency Xinhua, the automaker delivered 100,291 EVs from its Giga Shanghai factory in November — an all-time record and the first time it's topped 100,000 deliveries.\n\nThe figure represents a 40% rise month-over-month from October and a nearly 90% increase from a year ago. This follows month-by-month increases at Giga Shanghai after Tesla performed upgrades at the factory increase to production.\n\nHowever, it seems the upgrades may have been too productive, at least in the short term for Tesla. Reports from both Bloomberg and Reuters suggest Tesla will now cut production at Giga Shanghai, a possible sign demand is falling in the region.\n\nTesla is said to make cuts in production as early as this week, with reductions estimated at around 20% from full capacity. Giga Shanghai was running at full capacity in both October and November.\n\nBloomberg reports the decision to cut production was made “after the automaker evaluated its near-term performance in the domestic market, one of the people said, adding that there’s flexibility to increase output if demand increases.”\n\nTesla is denying the reports of a production cut in Shanghai, however. In a statement to Reuters, Tesla said media reports claiming Giga Shanghai would cut December output were \"untrue.\"\n\nThat being said, any potential cuts in production come after the automaker decreased prices for its cars in China earlier in October and also increased insurance incentives in order to boost supply.\n\nIn addition, competition is heating up in China’s EV market, the world’s largest. BYD, backed by Warren Buffett, posted nearly 230K deliveries last month, with nearly 114K EVs and 116K hybrids.\n\nFrom a pure output point of view, Gigafactory Shanghai is extremely productive, delivering more than 650,000 vehicles so far this year easily topping last year's total of 484,130, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The CPCA said Giga Shanghai's annual sales could possibly hit 750K units in 2022.\n\nEven if Tesla cuts production by 20%, the factory would be producing around 80K units a month, meaning it could theoretically reach nearly 1 million vehicles produced, making it the most productive EV factory in the world.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "title": "Oppenheimer downgrades Tesla stock, calls sentiment 'severely ...",
      "description": "Investors and the media are following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s plans for Twitter closely, but one Wall Street firm has had enough.",
      "content": "While investors are on edge awaiting the latest from Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s plans for Twitter, one Wall Street firm has had enough.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch downgraded Tesla stock to Perform from Outperform in a note to clients published Monday morning, saying challenges regarding Twitter have left sentiment towards Tesla shares \"severely damaged.\"\n\nSince Musk took ownership of Twitter in late October, Tesla shares are down about 30%.\n\n\"The combination of Twitter's unclear cash needs and diminishing options for Mr. Musk to serve those needs amid the broad public backlash driven by inconsistent standards application for Twitter users, notably banning select journalists, is pushing us to the sidelines on TSLA,\" Rusch wrote in a note to clients. \"We believe increasing negative sentiment on Twitter could linger long term, limiting its financial performance and become an ongoing overhang on TSLA.\"\n\nRusch's downgrade comes after an eventful weekend for Musk's leadership at Twitter, which resulted in a surprise poll from the billionaire on Sunday, which asked users whether he should step down as head of the social media company.\n\nMusk said he would abide by the results, which did show a majority support Musk leaving the top spot.\n\nRusch added: “We see potential for a negative feedback loop from departures of Twitter advertisers and users due to inconsistent standards resulting in increased financing needs that may lead to incremental TSLA sales just as Tesla's competitive environment intensifies.\"\n\nThose increased financing needs may have led Musk to sell 22 million shares of Tesla stock last week, worth around $3.6 billion. The overhang from those share sales sent Tesla shares tumbling 16% last week.\n\nReports over the weekend also said Musk is seeking additional equity investors for Twitter. Tesla shares were down more than 2% early Monday.\n\nRusch, however, believes it's not just the threat of large stock sales weighing on the stock, it's Elon Musk’s continued polarizing presence at Twitter that is damaging the Tesla brand.\n\n“While we have understood Twitter’s potential cash needs as a risk for TSLA shares, we believe banning journalists without consistent defensible standards or clear communication in an environment where many people believe free speech is at risk is too much for a majority of consumers to continue supporting Mr. Musk/TSLA, particularly people ideologically aligned with climate change mitigation,” Rusch wrote.\n\nRusch is not bearish on Tesla from a pure technology and expertise point of view, however. The firm believes Tesla is still driving down costs for EV manufacturing in the long term, and other manufacturers will struggle to match its efficiency.\n\nMoreover, Rusch sees this split between Musk's public drama related to Twitter and Tesla's actual business creating plenty of opportunity for investors.\n\n\"We expect TSLA to present myriad trading opportunities long and short,\" Rusch wrote. \"We believe sentiment is severely damaged and that any positive fundamental news near term will likely lead to select short covering followed by subsequent re-shorting.\"\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "A video of a Tesla Model Y driver losing control of their vehicle in Chaozhou in the Guangdong province made the rounds on social media this weekend. The accident resulted in three injuries and two deaths — and Tesla says data shows the driver didn’t hit the brake during the crash, Bloomberg reports.\n\nYou can watch the video below, though discretion is advised:\n• None These Are Your Guilty Pleasure Cars\n• None The 15 Most Successful Formula 1 Cars of All Time\n\nThe footage was captured on CCTV cameras. The driver appeared to attempt to park before the Model Y took off at high speed, traveling for around 1.2 miles. During that time, the driver collided with a motorcyclist and a high school girl on a bicycle, killing both. The driver, too, was injured.\n\nPolice are investigating the situation, and Tesla has agreed to cooperate. But the sparse details we have so far are strange. From Bloomberg:\n\nTesla, however, denies that post; it says that data pulled from the Model Y shows that there was no proof the brakes were ever engaged, which is backed up by the fact that the brake lights do not appear during the video. Further, Tesla said that the accelerator remained engaged during the incident — even reaching 100 percent activation.\n\nTesla also noted, though, that the driver did press the ‘Park’ button four times while traveling at high speed. However, the button must be pressed for an extended period of time for the vehicle to come to a stop.\n\nThis is far from the first time a Tesla in China has faced accusations of failed brakes, though so far, those claims have been unfounded, and several Tesla drivers later recanted their statements and apologized for spreading misinformation; Tesla, though, did offer a general apology for unrest.\n\nAs such, it is currently impossible to speculate on what happened in this incident, apart from what can be seen in the video. Whatever the result of the crash, it is deeply unfortunate that it has resulted in the deaths of two.\n• None These Cars Should Never Have Been Killed Off\n\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

      "description": "\"It's basically a peek behind the curtain into what made electric cars interesting over gas cars,\" YouTuber MKBHD said.",
      "content": "• A YouTube review of a 2008 Tesla Roadster shows how much the carmaker has evolved in 14 years.\n• Tesla's first model was a tiny sports car that was built off a Lotus Elise.\n• Since Tesla went public in 2010, the car company's value has soared over 26,000%.\n\nA recent review of Tesla's first car model from YouTuber Marques Keith Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, highlights how Elon Musk has helped transform the car brand from a fledgling startup to the top electric-car maker in the US.\n\n\"This is the most analog electric car I have ever sat in,\" MKBHD said. \"It's basically a peek behind the curtain into what made electric cars interesting over gas cars.\"\n\nMusk became Tesla's CEO in 2008. The same year, the automaker released the Tesla Roadster which was built on the chassis of a Lotus Elise — a tiny British sports car that Tesla remade into an electric car with a lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe car had just over a 240-mile range and sold for around $100,000. Tesla produced fewer than 2,500 Roadsters between 2008 and 2012. Today, the cars have become top collectors items and have sold individually for over $200,000.\n\nSince the electric-car maker went public in 2010, Tesla's value has soared more than 26,000%. Meanwhile, Teslas have become sleeker, faster, and even cheaper. The first Tesla was a little rough around the edges, as MKBHD points out. It didn't have Tesla's signature door handles, key fob, or giant screen.\n\n\"It's not designed to be comfortable,\" MKBHD said in the video, as he struggled to get into the tiny car. \"It's a fun piece to drive for a little while.\"",

      "title": "Elon had to choose between Twitter and Tesla. He's choosing Tesla.",
      "description": "The billionaire has faced questions from Tesla shareholders over where his priorities lie as the company's stock has sunk since he took over Twitter.",
      "content": "• Elon Musk has been forced to make a tough choice: Tesla or Twitter.\n• The billionaire has faced pressure from Tesla shareholders over his role at Twitter as shares have fallen.\n• In a poll, more than 17 million people said Musk should step down as Twitter CEO.\n\nPerhaps he was caught up in the euphoria of it all. But after spending the World Cup final in the stands of Qatar's Lusail Stadium on Sunday with one Jared Kushner and a gang of Gulf sheiks, Elon Musk decided to put a poll up on Twitter asking if he should stand down as CEO.\n\nAfter more than 17 million people cast their votes, the verdict is in: a majority of 57% think the billionaire Twitter owner should step aside. Musk said he would \"abide by the results of this poll,\" prompting speculation about an imminent resignation and suitable replacement candidates.\n\nThe poll came moments after Musk issued a mea culpa for introducing a new Twitter policy barring users from posting links to their profiles on rival social media sites such as Instagram, Mastodon, and Nostr – a move that sparked fury from users. Twitter deleted the policy after less than 12 hours.\n\nIn an analyst note on Monday, Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said the poll's results are not a surprise \"given that since Musk has taken over Twitter in late October it's essentially been a debacle of epic proportions.\"\n\nBut the poll ultimately comes as Musk needed to decide which company to run: Tesla or Twitter. His electric vehicle company got hammered last week by both analysts and shareholders, forcing him to choose which he wanted more.\n\nHe's picking Tesla, which represents nearly alf his $156 billion in estimated wealth, and the Twitter poll gave him a handy escape pod.\n\nMusk has faced questions about how he manages more than one compan for as long as he has been in the spotlighty. Overseeing Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, or Neuralink alone would be enough to keep even the most sure-footed CEO busy.\n\nWhen Twitter was added to the mix, Tesla backers were rightly concerned about yet another responsibility falling on Musk's shoulders. Those concerns coming to a head last week.\n\nOn December 14, Tesla's third-largest individual shareholder Leo KoGuan tweeted his frustrations with Musk, suggesting that he \"abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO.\" He said Musk should find a successor with independent supervision from the board of directors.\n\nRoss Gerber, a fellow Tesla shareholder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, tweeted on Saturday that \"it is in the best interest for Tesla shareholders for Elon to be back at Tesla working full time.\"\n\nThe frustrations are warranted. Tesla's market capitalization has tumbled to less than $500 billion for the first time since November 2020, a drop that wasn't helped by Musk selling off 22 million Tesla shares worth around $3.6 billion last week, according to SEC filings.\n\n\"If you look at the share price it continues to suffer,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. \"I think the markets are thinking, 'The person who drove this company to what it has got to has now taken an eye off the ball.'\"\n\nIn total, Musk has sold off around $23 billion in Tesla shares since announcing the Twitter takeover, as the size of the gamble he has made in buying Twitter – one he likely realized after trying to back out of the deal — has become more apparent.\n\nAlong with equity from investors including Sequoia Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority, the deal is financed by $13 billion of debt from a syndicate of banks including the likes of Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Barclays.\n\nIn an analyst note published on 14 December, Wedbush's Ives said that \"the Twitter nightmare continues as Musk uses Tesla as his own ATM machine to keep funding the red ink at Twitter which gets worse by the day.\"\n\nThat red ink wasn't as much of a problem when interest rates were low, and Tesla's shares were soaring. It was easier to use Tesla stock to fuel the kind of wild bet Musk made earlier this year when floating the idea of buying Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nBut as the Federal Reserve has aggressively hiked interest rates to curb inflation, using Tesla stock to pay off the debt on the Twitter buyout is a problem for Tesla.\n\n\"It's a major burden for the company, because it will get more expensive, or likely more expensive,\" Beauchamp said. \"It's something else to worry about.\"\n\nMusk seems painfully aware of the negative impacts of the wider economic downturn, tweeting on December 13 to \"beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates,\" shortly before news of his sale of Tesla stock became public.\n\nHe has also tried to defend the erasure of around $600 billion in Tesla market value by blaming the Fed. Responding to Gerber, he said that \"Tesla is executing better than ever,\" but \"we don't control the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nHowever, Tesla's challenges go beyond this, with the company underperforming the NASDAQ significantly in 2022, which has seen a broad range of tech businesses facing the same headwinds but without the same plunges in stock price.\n\n\n\n\"Tesla is so much an Elon stock, it stands or falls because of him,\" Beauchamp said. Tesla's stock price responded positively on Monday to the poll's results, rising almost 5%.\n\nThe Twitter chief has previously suggested he'd seek to find someone else to run Twitter in due course. Some close allies, such as computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman, have volunteered to run the social media company.\n\nBut Musk seems clear on how tall a task he'd be handing over, having botched several plans already, such as a new verification subscription plan and a seemingly arbitrary decision-making process on banning journalists, all while seeing advertisers flee the platform.\n\nOn Sunday, he tweeted: \"No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\"",

      "description": "There are more headaches for Tesla (TSLA) as the automaker revealed it is recalling 321,000 vehicles due to a safety issue.",
      "content": "There are more headaches for Tesla (TSLA) as the automaker revealed it is recalling 321,000 vehicles due to a safety issue.\n\nIn a filing posted over the weekend on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website, the automaker said some Tesla Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs had an issue that caused the tail lamps to “intermittently illuminate,” meaning poor visibility on the road in some instances. Tesla said the brake lights were not affected by the issue.\n\nTesla became aware of the issue from owners of cars in non-U.S. markets, and after investigating the issue, decided to perform a voluntary recall in order the fix the tail light malfunction. The recall will be performed via an over-the-air software update.\n\nThis weekend’s filing comes right after last Friday’s recall of around 30K Model X SUVs in the U.S. over a front passenger air bag issue, which will also be corrected with an OTA software update.\n\nTotal recalls for this year for Tesla now stand at 19 in the U.S, affecting nearly 3.77 million vehicles. Only Ford (F) has more vehicles affected by recalls, with approximately 8.8 million covering 63 recalls, according to NHTSA data. Note that vehicles can be subject to multiple recalls, so the exact number of vehicles affected by a recall this year is actually smaller than the total amount listed by NHTSA.\n\nNevertheless, mounting recall and remediation measures needed does take a toll on Tesla’s resources, at a time when the company is ramping up production across the globe as it tries to reach its 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) goal for vehicle deliveries, which would be around 1.4 million cars. CEO Elon Musk warned last quarter that the 2022 deliveries goal would likely be missed, though production figures would surpass a 50% growth rate in Q4.\n\nMeanwhile, call are growing for Musk to focus more attention on the issues at hand at Tesla instead of spending time dealing with Twitter, which Musk purchased at the end of October. Growing competition from traditional automakers, and a weakening global economy, may hurt Tesla’s EV-market dominance.\n\nTesla’s stock price has been affected by these concerns, with shares down over 50% year to date.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But now we’re learning that batteries have their own reliability problems. It’s not clear how utility PG&E ’s enormous 182.5 megawatt Tesla battery caught fire Tuesday, but the site had to be disconnected from the grid.",

      "description": "Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives joins Emily Chang to discuss the latest from Tesla's earnings and what it says about the future of the EV industry. (Source: Bloomberg)",
      "content": "All right. What's your takeaway from the results we just saw? Look, I think clearly the 3Q do every miss. There was an expectation that revenues could be light. I think margins will be a focus. Came in light there. The street was hoping ultimately for a better margin performance. I think really the headline sticking to the underlying 50 percent growth for the year in terms of deliveries to the conference call is going to be key in terms of are they backing away from that? Clearly they're not. It shows the China growth story still continues to be there. And that's really going to be the bull bear to be come out of this call. About the demand story, you see. What do you see as the difference between the US and China? I know there have been some concerns about wait times in China shrinking, which, you know, counterintuitively is maybe not a good sign. Sure. I think in China productions rammed through CAC. So if you look at wait times, what's happened there? That's going to start to stabilize. But ultimately, the production out of China continues to really increase. Look, that's the hearts and lungs of the tests of bull story in terms of China. Now, if you look what's happened from a macro perspective, no, clearly we're seeing softness, but we believe what we're seeing in tests is much more logistics driven rather than demand driven. And that, in my opinion, is why I think this is just more massive speed bumps are navigating. But ultimately from Moscow, it's a moment of truth. I mean, this is the time to sort of navigate through the turbulence because investors see a white knuckles concerned. Are you about the battery situation? Look, I'm concerned about it. But ultimately, as we go into first half of next year, I believe that does start to stabilize. I still believe demand is outstripping supply for Tesla. And that's why it's all about can they fulfill two million units in terms to go into 2023 if they can, then test is a stock that, in my opinion, could be up 40, 50 percent from these levels. But in this backdrop, this report, in my opinion, it's must most important conference call probably in the last two and a half, three years. It might also be the last conference call before he buys Twitter. Right. A deal could be sealed in a matter of days. And we've seen Tesla shares very much intertwined with what's happening with Twitter. Are you expecting a potential negative impact from that deal? I mean, you've talked about I mean, naturally the albatross around the tassel story, because ultimately the worry is the financing in this market starts to fall through a bit. Does he have to come up with more capital? Do you see for him for is does he sell an incremental 5, 10 billion dollars of Tesla's stock to fund Twitter? And that's why the frustration now for the Tesla investors is it feels like musk jug and a lot of balls. You've got the Twitter situation. And right now he's continuing to trade caviar for two dollars, slice of pizza in terms of Twitter stock. Are you worried about the ball mean that's in there? Well, I think that's that's one of the biggest problems, is that mosque is the key to the Tesla story. He's ultimately really the reason that Tess has been able to get in this position. And I think he really needs to ultimately give investors confidence that he's their pilot on the plane. And you're not ultimately going to see shortfalls as we go into Q4 and especially going 2023 in such a pivotal year for E.D.. What do you want to see and what do Tesla investors want to see in terms of his management approach to Twitter? Like not managing Twitter at all? Well, I think part of it as a tacit investor, you want ultimately see him navigate this and only give the reins to social media experts. That could ultimately be the ones that could try to turn Twitter around from most. The easiest thing was buying Twitter. The hardest part is going to be fixing it. That's going to be an ever psych uphill battle from Musk in terms of fixing Twitter. But as a Tesla investor at such a crucial time, you need steady hands. And that's really why this conference call, the next few quarters are just so crucial. What I believe is in the history of the Telstra story. Well, it may be for on honestly almost every company, given the macro economic conditions that we're facing and Moscow potentially now multiple companies that are facing these macro economic conditions. What's your outlook over the next six months as we potentially head into a recession and a downturn that could last? Some people are telling me two to three years. I think in terms of disruptive technology who are going to be the winners over the next two, three years. Tesla's front and center, along with Apple and a handful of other names like Microsoft. When you look at Tesla as we went back three years ago, look how they navigate through what I view as almost historic challenges. MUSK The challenge is not demand. It's logistics. And if you look at China, I believe this will ultimately be a period of time that test was able to navigate. And I do believe the multiple starts to reread. You start to ultimately see margins start to come back. And I think we look at this as just a blip on the radar over and over and overall called five, six years. Cyber track. What do you want to hear because you want to hear it that's come in 2023 because you got all the Detroit stalwarts that are ready to get those trucks out there. Also, you have Revere and others. This is going to be an arms race in terms of pickup truck for evey need to make sure it doesn't keep continue. Get to lead. But it goes back to your navigating space X Tesla. Now Twitter and there is, you know, ultimately which kid you love the most. And that's going to be the issue for much because the golden child continues to be tested. We hear so much about Gwynne Shotwell at Space ISE. How deep is the bench at Tesla if his attentions are divided? Well, it's no different. If Judge and Stan. We're not playing for the Yankees, right? Yeah. You got it. You got a bench there. But ultimately, Musk is continue to key to the Tesla story. They have navigate a bit of a bench, but which is the clear? I mean, that is the biggest worry right now in the story. And of course, time's ticking. Next Friday, that's when the Twitter deal is supposed to close. Otherwise, we end to a Game of Thrones and Delaware.",

      "description": "The firm said ongoing negative headlines around Twitter could create a 'negative feedback loop' that could hurt sales of Tesla vehicles.",
      "content": "Elon Musk's handling of Twitter is damaging sentiment around Tesla , according to Oppenheimer. Analyst Colin Rusch downgraded shares of Tesla to perform from outperform, saying he can no longer separate coverage of the electric vehicle maker from Musk's controversial management of the social media platform. \"While we continue to see Tesla evolving EV and autonomous technology in advance of peers and driving costs to levels those peers will struggle to match—and have tried to separate Elon Musk's non-Tesla endeavors (personal and professional) from our analysis on TSLA—we believe Mr. Musk's acquisition and subsequent management of Twitter now make that separation untenable,\" Rusch wrote in a Monday note. \"The combination of Twitter's unclear cash needs and diminishing options for Mr. Musk to serve those needs amid the broad public backlash driven by inconsistent standards application for Twitter users, notably banning select journalists, is pushing us to the sidelines on TSLA,\" he added. Tesla shares, which are notably volatile, are down 57% this year. However, the analyst expects that the ongoing negative headlines around Twitter could create a \"negative feedback loop\" that would hurt sales of Tesla vehicles. \"[We] believe banning journalists without consistent defensible standards or clear communication in an environment where many people believe free speech is at risk is too much for a majority of consumers to continue supporting Mr. Musk/TSLA, particularly people ideologically aligned with climate change mitigation,\" Rusch said. The analyst removed his price target of $436 price target on Tesla. Shares of Tesla closed at $150.23 on Friday. \"We believe increasing negative sentiment on Twitter could linger long term, limiting its financial performance and become an ongoing overhang on TSLA,\" Rusch wrote. To be sure, Musk conducted a poll Sunday asking Twitter users whether he should step down, with most respondents voting yes . Musk said there's no successor in place at the moment. Tesla shares jumped 4% in the premarket. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

However, the analyst expects that the ongoing negative headlines around Twitter could create a \"negative feedback loop\" that would hurt sales of Tesla vehicles. To be sure, Musk conducted a poll Sunday asking Twitter users whether he should step down, with most respondents voting yes .",

      "description": "Tesla’s third-largest shareholder tweeted that Musk had “abandoned Tesla” and that the company “has no working CEO\"",
      "content": "Elon Musk sold around $3.6 billion worth of shares of his flagship company Tesla this week, despite reassuring investors in April that he had “no further TSLA sales planned” after he secured the funds to acquire Twitter in a $44 billion deal.\n\nThe sale was revealed in an SEC filing submitted by Musk showing that between Monday and Wednesday he offloaded around 22 million shares of the electric vehicle company. The total value of Musk’s Tesla stock sales this year is estimated to amount to around $40 billion.\n• None Trump's Cringiest Reply Guys Are Out of Twitter Jail. Their New Target Is Elon Musk\n• None Jack Dorsey Takes Blame for Twitter Failures, Will Give $1 Million to Signal\n\nTesla’s stock has underperformed an already struggling tech market in 2022, in part due to investors balking at Musk’s sloppy takeover of Twitter. $TSLA is down more than 50 percent year to date, compared to a general 16 percent decline across the S&P 500. The financial struggles have cost Musk his title of “Richest Man In The World,” with Bernard Arnault, founder and CEO of LVMH, taking over the top spot on the Forbes list earlier this week.\n\nDespite the stock dump, Musk has tweeted several times this week that investors should remain confident, writing that he would “make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term.”\n\nInvestors and executives at Tesla have raised concerns regarding Musk’s shifted focus to Twitter. On Wednesday, Tesla’s third-largest shareholder, investor Leo KoGuan, tweeted that Musk had “abandoned Tesla” and that the company “has no working CEO.” Other prominent investors have echoed the concerns. Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black tweeted that the market was indicating that “the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”\n• None The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nClick here to read the full article.",

      "content": "NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is growing again, but there’s little comfort for the industry. The $760 billion electric-vehicle manufacturer produced nearly 366,000 cars in the third quarter, a 41% increase from the previous three-month stretch that also reversed a first-half slump. The number of cars it delivered to customers, however, fell 5% short of what analysts were expecting, which the company attributed to shipping woes. Tesla shares tumbled 8% on Monday.\n\nFreighters that haul vehicles have experienced a sticky price surge since the pandemic started despite broader supply-chain improvement. Various measures of shipping rates, including Drewry’s World Container Index and the Baltic Dry index (.BADI) – down 20% this year – show cost pressures elsewhere easing. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (XWGSCP=ECI) has declined for four straight months to its lowest reading since January 2021.\n\nPut it altogether, and the changes imply that the car business keeps struggling even with signs of improving access to microchips and moderating costs in other sectors. Ford Motor (F.N), for one, issued a profit warning for the third quarter. With additional problems mounting, Tesla and its peers are spinning their wheels.

      "content": "Elon Musk cut nine percent off the price of a new Tesla, but only if it’s one made and sold in China; Hyundai wants you to know that it’s a luxury carmaker now; and the U.S. is gonna need to mine a whole lot more lithium for all these upcoming EVs. All this and more in The Morning Shift for Monday, October 24, 2022.\n\n\n\nWe’re always moaning about the lack of an affordable electric vehicle and the cost of cars, on the whole, going up and up. But, after incrementally hiking the prices of its cars for years, Tesla has started lowering them again - but there’s a catch.\n• None The 2022 Civic Si Sure Seems To Make More Power Than Honda Says\n• None You Can Now Sleep In A Retired Semi Truck Trailer Tiny House\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Tesla is chopping up to nine percent off the cars it makes and sells, but only in China. Bloomberg reports:\n\nThe cuts only apply to the Model 3 and Model Y cars produced in China, but include Performance, Rear-Wheel-Drive and Long-Range variants. The firm attributes the price cut to “improved utilization of the company’s Shanghai factory and “relative stability” of the supply chain.”\n\nHere in the U.S., there has so far been no such cut. The Model 3 still starts at $48,490 and the Y is offered from $67,990.\n\nToyota likes to remind everyone that it was one of the first companies to mass-produce a hybrid car. The Prius, when it launched in 2000, quickly won the hearts of many eco-conscious drivers and now continues to do so with its fourth generation.\n\nBut times have changed, and drivers worried about their environmental impact have sold off their Prius (Prii, Priuses?) and switched to EVs. Toyota, however, didn’t get that memo so has appeared reluctant to make the switch to battery-powered cars. Now, the company is trying to rectify this with a new approach to electrification. Reuters reports:\n\nWhile the proposals are scrutinized, Toyota has reportedly suspended work on some of the 30 EV projects announced in December, which Reuters reports could include the Toyota Compact Cruiser crossover and the battery-electric Crown.\n\nSo Toyota is delaying EVs while it decides how it wants to roll out EVs. That definitely sounds like the behavior of a company committed to making EVs.\n\n3rd Gear: Hyundai Wants to be a Luxury Carmaker\n\nCar maker of the moment, Hyundai, cut its teeth making affordable cars that offer something for everyone. But now, the Korean automaker wants you to know that it’s serious about something, and that something is luxury EVs.\n\nThat’s right, Bloomberg reports that Hyundai is switching its focus to high-growth segments such “luxury models, SUVs and electric vehicles” as it targets “record-high earnings.” The announcement came after the automaker missed its sales and earnings targets for the third quarter of 2022. According to Bloomberg:\n\nDespite struggles for its global sales, Hyundai did have a pretty good third quarter stateside. Sales increased three percent compared with the same period last year.\n\n4th Gear: We Need to Mine More Lithium\n\nBut if Hyundai and other legacy automakers want to switch to focus on electric vehicles, they’re going to need more supplies, a lot more supplies. Chief among those supplies are all the components required to make bigger batteries, including lithium.\n\nHere in the U.S., miners extract roughly 1,000 tons of lithium each year —accounting for just one percent of global lithium production. But, after the Inflation Reduction Act added stipulations for EVs made with components sourced and assembled here in America, that output is going to need to rise dramatically.\n\nAccording to Automotive News, the electric car industry needs “about 50 more lithium mines” to open around the world to keep up with demand. Steps are being taken to try and ramp up lithium production to meet the demands for Evs, as Automotive News reports:\n\nBut, the site warns that new mines face a raft of hurdles before they can get up and running. Chief among them is the way the U.S. hands out mining permits for companies hoping to extract lithium from the Earth.\n\nThis, it warns, can mean it takes up to a decade to open a new lithium mine here in America. And if this process can’t be streamlined, we may soon be talking about a lithium shortage as well as a chip shortage, aluminum shortage, and titanium shortage.\n\n5th Gear: ‘Flying Taxis’ are Apparently Going Into Production\n\nAnother week, another flying taxi prototype that’s definitely going to exist. The world’s rich and powerful seem obsessed with the idea of zipping around cities in personal quadcopters that they like to pretend are flying cars. Now, there’s a new one that promises that it will actually make it to production, maybe.\n\nA company called Archer Aviation claims it will build 250 battery-electric air taxis in 2025, before moving to scale up production in the following years. Reuters reports that the firm hopes to have its craft certified to fly before all this, with sights set on 2024 for that milestone.\n\nWhen this, and all the other drawings of aircraft go into production, the electric flying taxi market, or whatever people want to call it, is set to be a pretty crowded space. As Reuters reports:\n\nI, and many other people remain unconvinced by all these personal flying machines. Will they ever make it to market? And, if they do, will the rules and regulations governing flying around cities adapt quickly enough to keep up?\n\nHow was your weekend? I hope it was nice! I spent mine dog-sitting and listening to the new Arctic Monkeys album, which coincidentally is called The Car. By my count, there are four tracks on there that talk about cars, and that seems like enough to warrant a mention here. Go listen; it’s perfect.\n• None Ducati Drops Two New Scrambler Models With Throwback Style\n\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

      "title": "Tesla Closes Flagship China Showroom",
      "description": "Electric vehicle giant Tesla has closed what had been its flagship showroom in China, a move sources described as one aimed at paring retail costs in its second-largest market.",
      "content": "Tesla confirmed the closure of the showroom in Beijing's upscale downtown shopping center Parkview Green to Reuters on Wednesday. It said it had relocated the store to another mall called Raffles City. That showroom was opened in mid-October and is smaller than the original two-floor showroom in Parkview Green.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the matter previously said Tesla had shut the Parkview Green showroom late last week. The store, opened in 2013, was Tesla's first in China and was renovated and expanded in 2018.\n\nA member of the mall's staff confirmed to Reuters during a visit to the site on Wednesday that Tesla had shut the showroom, whose windows are now plastered with posters belonging to the next tenant, a streetwear brand BAPE.\n\n\"Their contract with us expired and Tesla decided not to extend it,\" the mall staff member said.\n\nA call to the store earlier in the day was redirected to the Raffles City showroom.\n\nTesla owns and runs over 200 outlets across the country that display models and arrange test drives for potential buyers.\n\nReuters reported in September that Tesla was considering closing some showrooms in flashy malls in cities like Beijing after traffic plunged during COVID restrictions.\n\nIt also plans to put more emphasis on stores in less-costly suburban locations that can also provide repairs as the company works to meet Chief Executive Elon Musk's goal of improving service for customers.\n\nAs part of that effort, Tesla has been hiring technicians and other staff for service jobs in China. The company's China recruitment website showed 305 openings for service jobs as of Wednesday, little changed from September.\n\nMore than half of Tesla's China stores do not offer repair or maintenance services and are in high-rent locations where space is limited. That included the now-closed Parkview Green Tesla store.\n\nTesla owns all of its own stores rather than relying on dealers. It also sells its cars online. That has allowed it more leeway to adjust a retail strategy that had been initially modeled on Apple's glossy stores in high-rent locations.\n\nTesla has cut starter prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China, reversing a trend of price increases across the industry amid signs of softening demand in the world's largest auto market.\n\nTesla sold 318,151 vehicles in China in the first nine months of 2022, up 55% from a year earlier, according the China Passenger Car Association. By comparison, overall sales of electric vehicles and hybrids increased 113.2%.",

      "title": "Tesla critic claims his anti-Tesla ad was banned from Twitter for ‘political’ reasons",
      "description": "Dan O’Dowd delights in annoying Elon Musk.",
      "content": "The Dawn Project, an anti-Tesla advocacy group fronted by software developer Dan O’Dowd, claims that Twitter rejected its attempts to promote a tweet about a full-page ad running in The New York Times criticizing Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature. In a screenshot of an email provided by the group, Twitter said the tweet contravened its policy regarding “political” ads.\n\nThe rejected ad was the latest development in a weird, long-running feud between Elon Musk and O’Dowd, who ran a failed campaign for US Senate in California earlier this year. In August, Tesla sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Dawn Project over the group’s YouTube videos of Tesla vehicles running over child-size mannequins. (The videos no longer appear on the group’s YouTube page.)\n\nThe Dawn Project’s tweet about the Times ad is still up, but the group is not able to promote it, which could limit its engagement.\n\nThe group’s claims also raise questions about Twitter’s advertising policy in the wake of Musk’s takeover of the social media company. Several major car companies, including GM, Jeep, and Volkswagen, have paused all paid advertising posts on Twitter as they wait to see what the platform will look like under the new leadership. Meanwhile, Musk has tweeted that Twitter has suffered a “massive” drop in advertising revenue, even as user growth is at an “all-time high.”\n\nIn a statement, O’Dowd said the ad’s rejection was a troubling sign. “The move to prohibit the advertising of content criticizing Musk’s Tesla Full Self-Driving software raises serious questions over his commitment to free speech,” O’Dowd said in a statement. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Musk has fired 50 percent of the company’s employees, including most of the public communications team.)\n\nContent that references a candidate, political party, elected or appointed government official, election, referendum, ballot measure, legislation, regulation, directive, or judicial outcome. Ads that contain references to political content, including appeals for votes, solicitations of financial support, and advocacy for or against any of the above-listed types of political content, are prohibited under this policy. We also do not allow ads of any type by candidates, political parties, or elected or appointed government officials.\n\n“Twitter globally prohibits the promotion of political content,” the company says on its support page. “We have made this decision based on our belief that political message reach should be earned, not bought.”\n\nO’Dowd launched a campaign for Senate earlier this year premised on one issue: Tesla. He has been highly critical of the company’s FSD driver-assist feature, conducting his own tests that he claims highlight the technology’s critical shortcomings. (O’Dowd only got 74,916 votes in the June primary, coming in 10th overall.)\n\nThe Santa Barbara billionaire clearly relishes irking Musk. He previously ran a full-page ad in The New York Times disparaging Tesla’s FSD, offering $10,000 to the first person who could name “another commercial product from a Fortune 500 company that has a critical malfunction every 8 minutes.”\n\nTesla supporters note that O’Dowd runs Green Hills Software, which does business with some of Tesla’s competitors, including General Motors, BMW, and Ford. Tesla’s supporters note that he has a financial stake in publicly shaming the company. Meanwhile, Musk responded to the Dawn Project in his own fashion, noting that no one has died while using FSD and labeling Green Hills Software “a pile of trash.”\n\nSince taking over Twitter last month, Musk has moved swiftly to put his imprimatur on the social media platform. The company banned several accounts for impersonating Musk, including comedian Kathy Griffin and Mad Men actor Rich Sommer. Musk later announced that “any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended.”",

      "content": "Washington, DC (CNN Business) Tesla will hold its second annual AI Day in Palo Alto, California, Friday evening. The six-hour event will include updates on Tesla ( TSLA )'s work in artificial intelligence, \"Full Self-Driving,\" its supercomputer \"Dojo\" and maybe a humanoid robot, according to invitations posted online by Tesla supporters. The event is expected to be live-streamed.\n\nDojo is a supercomputer being designed to train AI systems to complete complex tasks like Tesla's driver-assistance systems Autopilot and \"Full Self-Driving,\" which sometimes perform some driving tasks like steering and keeping up with traffic. Tesla's previous AI Day included detailed technical explanations of the company's work in a bid to attract leading engineers.\n\nTesla CEO ElonMusk has claimed before that in the long run people will think of Tesla as an AI company, rather than a car company or energy company. He has said that Tesla AI may play a role in computers matching general human abilities, a huge milestone many experts say is decades away and perhaps unattainable . Musk, who has a long history of predictions, has said it may be reached in 2029.\n\nBut more limited and easier to develop forms of artificial intelligence — like identifying emergency vehicles stopped on a highway — have proven to be a significant hurdle for the company as it pursues its dreams of self-driving cars. AI powers \"Full Self-Driving,\" but the system has faced criticism and backlash as it still requires driver intervention to prevent collisions and Musk's deadlines for its capabilities slip year after year.\n\nAnd this summer Tesla's director of artificial intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, exited the company, several months after it was announced he was taking a sabbatical.\n\nIt's not easy to predict what may or may not show up at any event helmed by Musk. Products heralded and talked about sometimes don't perform as designed — like when Musk showed off the Tesla Cybertruck's supposedly \"unbreakable\" windows, that promptly broke — and can't even be bought years later. (Three years after the event Tesla sells a T-shirt that memorializes the broken window, but it has yet to sell a Cybertruck.)\n\nMusk has unquestionably disrupted entire industries with his work at Tesla and SpaceX. But he's also earned a reputation for missing deadlines and overpromising.\n\nMusk then claimed that the automaker is building a 5-foot-8, 125-pound humanoid robot, called Optimus or Tesla Bot and a prototype would likely be unveiled this year. It's unclear if a prototype will be revealed Friday, but Musk tweeted Thursday that the event would include \"cool hardware demos.\"\n\nMusk claimed last year that the humanoid robot would have a profound impact on the economy. It would begin by working on boring, repetitive and dangerous tasks, he said.\n\nHumanoid robots have long fascinated the public and earned a place in pop culture as powerful but sometimes dangerous. Tesla tapped into this when it posted on Instagram in a promotion for the event that, \"if you can run faster than 5 mph, you'll be fine.\" The Tesla humanoid robot is planned to have a top speed of 5 mph, the automaker has said.\n\nBut creating a humanoid robot that rivals a human's abilities has proved incredibly difficult for robotics experts. Artificial intelligence has seen major advances yet trails the general abilities of a human toddler. Most robots in use today are restricted to simple tasks in basic environments like vacuuming a home or moving parts in a factory.\n\nMusk said Thursday that AI Day would be \"highly technical\" as it is meant for recruiting engineers to work on artificial intelligence, robotics and computer chips.\n\n\"Engineers who understand what problems need to be solved will like what they see,\" Musk tweeted Friday.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

He has said that Tesla AI may play a role in computers matching general human abilities, a huge milestone many experts say is decades away and perhaps unattainable . \n\nHumanoid robots have long fascinated the public and earned a place in pop culture as powerful but sometimes dangerous.",

      "content": "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nChina ADRs – Shares of China-based companies that trade in the U.S. rose in the premarket after the easing of Covid restrictions by the Chinese government. Among them: Alibaba (BABA) was higher by 1.5%, JD.com (JD) gained 2.2% and Pinduoduo (PDD) was up 2.1%.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) – Southwest slid 4.1% in the premarket following thousands of flight cancellations over the holiday weekend, a higher amount than experienced by other major airlines amid winter storm issues. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) all rose in premarket action.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – Tesla fell 5.3% in premarket trading, after falling for six consecutive trading days and nine of the past ten. Tesla is down about 65% for the year to date, and on pace for its largest-ever yearly loss. The latest slide follows news that the automaker will run production at a reduced rate at its Shanghai factory in January, following an end-of-December shutdown.\n\nPeloton (PTON) – Peloton is selling refurbished bikes at discounts of up to $500 compared with new ones. The new program is the latest effort by Peloton to boost demand, following the expansion of its rental program earlier this year. Peloton rose 1% in the premarket.\n\nNio (NIO) – Shares of the Chinese electric car maker slumped 6.4% in premarket trading after it cut its fourth-quarter delivery forecast, saying the Covid breakout in major China cities constrained its supply chain.\n\nFarfetch (FTCH) – The luxury e-commerce platform operator was assigned a B- rating by S&P Global Ratings with a negative outlook, which noted the company's significant negative cash flow. Farfetch rose 1% in premarket action.",

      "title": "‘Tesla has no working CEO’: As stock drops 61% from its peak, a major Tesla shareholder calls for Elon Musk’s ouster",
      "description": "Tesla investors are starting to wonder if CEO Elon Musk is still the right man to lead the company after he acquired Twitter.",
      "content": "Tesla investors are starting to wonder if CEO Elon Musk is still the right man to lead the company. With much of Musk’s attention focused on Twitter, which he’s shaking up following his $44 billion takeover in late October, doubts are increasing about his ability to effectively lead the electric-vehicle maker.\n\nIt doesn’t help that he’s sold vast quantities of his personal Tesla shares this year as the carmaker’s stock has plunged about 61% from its peak late last year. That includes the sale of $3.6 billion in stock that he disclosed on Wednesday. He tweeted in April, after selling 4.4 million shares for $4 billion, “No further TSLA sales planned after today.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Leo Koguan, one of Tesla’s largest individual shareholders, called for a leadership change, tweeting: “Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO. Tesla needs and deserves to have working full time CEO.”\n\nLeo said someone more focused on the operational side of the company, similar to Tim Cook at Apple, should take over the company. Cook became Apple CEO after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs, who like Musk was strong on the visionary side.\n\n“Elon is a mere hired hands,” Leo added. “He is our employee…Elon was the proud father, Tesla has grown up. An executioner, Tim Cook-like is needed, not Elon.”\n\nLeo’s comments were in sharp contrast to ones he himself offered in January, when he tweeted, \"Tesla bulls, the future rainbow are here and now. Smile to your fortunate self.\"\n\nAt that time, Tesla had a market cap of $1.2 trillion and ranked among the world’s most valuable companies. On Wednesday, its market cap dropped below $500 billion for the first time since Nov. 23, 2020.\n\n\"For investors, the clock has struck 12. Frustration has massively built, and Musk appears to be doubling-down, not backing away,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nIves believes Musk overpaid for Twitter by about $20 billion and needed to tap into his Tesla shares to pay for the acquisition.\n\n\"One of investors' bigger concerns is that Musk is using Tesla as an ATM machine,\" Ives said. \"That has been a massive overhang on Tesla's stock.\"\n\nAnother concern is that Musk’s perceived lean toward far-right beliefs on Twitter could translate to left-leaning car buyers avoiding Teslas. They’ll certainly have more options, with more automakers piling into the EV space. S&P Global Mobility recently predicted that Tesla’s market share in the U.S. will drop from 65% this year to below 20% by 2025.\n\nGary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund and a Tesla shareholder, tweeted on Wednesday about Musk: \"He will realize soon (if not already) that his polarizing political views are hurting customer perceptions of $TSLA EVs. Customers don't want their cars to be controversial. They want to be proud as hell to drive them — not embarrassed.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \n\nRishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year\n\nMeet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation\n\nHow much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home\n\nElon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’",

      "content": "Tesla stock has declined by roughly 19% over the past month (21 trading days). There are multiple factors weighing on the stock. Firstly, Tesla continues to be weighed down by CEO Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of the social media app Twitter. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his individual capacity, he offloaded Tesla shares to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load. In early November, he sold another 19.5 million Tesla shares, per an SEC filing, in a transaction worth $3.95 billion. The Twitter acquisition might also be seen as an unwanted distraction for Mr. Musk, forcing him to take time away from his role at Tesla. Separately, there are also concerns that Tesla’s growth could cool off amid a broader economic slowdown, particularly in markets like China. Tesla cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China in October and Chinese tech media Huxiu reports that another price cut could be around the corner.\n\nHowever, now that Tesla stock has seen a decline of about 19% over the last month, will it continue its downward trajectory in the near term, or is a recovery imminent? Going by historical performance, there is a 69% chance of a rise in TSLA stock over the next month. in the last ten years that Tesla stock saw a twenty-one-day decline of 19% or more, resulted in the stock rising over the (twenty-one trading days). This historical pattern reflects 90 out of 130, or a 69% chance of a rise in TSLA stock over the coming month , implying a positive near-term outlook for the stock.

      "title": "Down 50% This Year, Is Tesla Stock A Buy?",
      "description": "While growth stocks in general have been hit by high inflation and rising interest rates, Tesla faces a couple of other challenges.",
      "content": "Tesla stock has seen considerable selling pressure losing about 50% of its value over the year. While growth stocks in general have been hit by high inflation and rising interest rates, Tesla faces a couple of other challenges. Firstly, there are real concerns that demand could be slowing down, particularly in China, which has been a big source of growth for Tesla. The company cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China in October, and Bloomberg recently reported that Tesla has planned to scale back production of the Model Y by 20% at its Shanghai factory. Separately, Tesla continues to be weighed down by CEO Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of the social media app Twitter. Although Mr. Musk purchased the social media company in his personal capacity, he has been offloading Tesla stock to fund the purchase and free up liquidity to manage the loss-making social media company, which has a massive debt load. This has created an overhang over the stock. The Twitter acquisition might also be seen as an unwanted distraction for Mr. Musk, forcing him to take time away from his role at Tesla.\n\nWe have reduced our price estimate for Tesla stock by about 10% to $272. However, our price estimate still remains about 50% ahead of the current market price. Tesla’s execution has been solid so far and the company has a goal of growing its deliveries by over 50% each year over a multi-year horizon. While this plan could be challenged in the near term given the mounting economic headwinds, Tesla should remain a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to electric drivetrains. Production capacity has traditionally been a big bottleneck for Tesla and the company has been addressing this, with new factories in Texas and Berlin coming online and ramping up capacity. Tesla is also slated to bolster its model lineup. The Cybertruck pickup truck is likely to go into production next year while deliveries of the semi truck recently began. Tesla’s margins are also among the highest in the auto industry and this should enable the company to be solidly profitable as sales rise further. See our analysis on Tesla Valuation: Is TSLA Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on Tesla’s valuation and how it compares with peers. For more information on Tesla’s business model and revenue trends, check out our dashboard on Tesla Revenue: How TSLA Makes Money.\n\nWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

      "content": "It will be another big quarter for Tesla (TSLA), and the markets overall, when the EV giant reports Q3 earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nThat revenue figure would represent more than a $5 billion jump from Q2, where Tesla experienced COVID-related and operations optimizing shutdowns in Shanghai. Year over year that estimated revenue figure would be a nearly 61% jump from Q3 of 2021.\n\nOn the profitability end, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income and EBITDA figures that are higher than a year go and higher sequentially.\n\nLooking ahead to the earnings call, investors and analysts will be focused on any clues to the demand story for Tesla, which some are concerned might be cooling off in the face of a Fed-induced slowing economy.\n\n“While we believe demand for Tesla products exceeds supply, it would be unreasonable to assume that there is (a) a limit to how much Tesla can continue to increase prices without demand suffering and (b) that the company was not exposed to decelerating macroeconomic growth,” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas said in a note to investors two weeks ago.\n\n\"A top concern right now is demand in China as wait times seem to be shrinking,\" RBC Capital Markets said in a note. \"Question is if this is a blip or signs of a bigger change among consumers.\"\n\nOf course Tesla’s production outlook will also be scrutinized, with analysts looking for any change to Tesla’s 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) target. The ramp-ups in Giga Berlin and Austin will also be top of mind, as well as whether Giga Shanghai is fully back after its latest idling due to operational improvements.\n\nOn the products end, there will be an expectation for CEO Elon Musk and the team to share more information on the rollout of Tesla semi, which Musk said will begin deliveries in early September to Pepsi and whether there will be more updates coming on the Tesla Cybertruck’s industrialization process as well as its future product roadmap.\n\nFor others on the Street, in order to stop the free fall in Tesla shares the company must outline a realistic plan for growth, with analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives saying they're “laser-focused” on its strategy for getting there.\n\n“For Musk the clock has struck midnight for the Street to stop the excuses and noise ... Now is the time to execute on reasonable growth and unit targets into 4Q/2023 and it starts with tomorrow's conference call,” Ives wrote in a note this morning.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "Tesla Earnings Preview: Sales, Semis, & Shanghai In Focus\n\n            With the looming sale of Twitter playing out in the background (along the capital needs necessary to facilitate it coming due), we can't say we'd be surprised by an \"optimistic\" spin on Tesla's earnings this afternoon. \n\nThe company is expected to post earnings of $1 per share, down from $1.06 per share, and $22.1 billion in revenue, down from $22.7 billion. \"Analysts are penciling in an operating profit of about $3.9 billion, compared with $4.1 billion earlier,\" Barron's reported on Wednesday. \n\nOf the largest questions up in the air for the company is going to be demand. With extra production facilities coming online in the months prior to a global economic slowdown and increased competition, Wall Street will be looking for cues as to whether or not Tesla can remain competitive in the increasingly saturated EV space. \nSource: Barron's\n\nAt the end of September that the company was urging employees to help keep up with incredible delivery demand. electrek dutifully reported at the end of September that Tesla was expecting a \"very high volume\" of vehicle deliveries during the end of the quarter. \n\nWhile they did produce a record for the quarter, the numbers fell short of some Wall Street estimates. Tesla also recently set a record for the number of vehicles it delivered in China, despite the fact that the number missed some Wall Street estimates. \n\nThe China Passenger Car Association revealed the numbers earlier this month. They mark an 8% increase from August and \"outpaced the more than the 5% month-over-month growth of all wholesale electric vehicle sales in China\", CNBC noted. \n\nThe prior sales record was set in June when the company sold 78,906 China-made vehicles. The new record comes after Tesla shut down Shanghai for a portion of the summer in order to upgrade the facilities. \n\n\n\nSource: @Sino_MarketRecall, the automaker also broke total delivery records for Q3, despite the fact that it missed expectations from Wall Street for the quarter. Tesla reported 343,830 deliveries for Q3 2022.\n\n\n\nThe company delivered 325,158 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and delivered 18,672 Model S and Model X vehicles. It blamed logistics for its miss of estimates and noted that a number of vehicles were \"in transit\". \n\n\"Historically, our delivery volumes have skewed towards the end of each quarter due to regional batch building of cars.  As our production volumes continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistics weeks,\" the company wrote in its press release earlier this month. \n\n\"In Q3, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter.  These cars have been ordered and will be delivered to customers upon arrival at their destination.\"\n\nDuring today's conference call, which Elon Musk has said he will be attending, investors will likely be looking for more details on:\n\nThe company announcing that its first semi trucks would be shipping to Pepsi in December. We noted a video a couple of days ago that showed a Tesla Semi broken down on a highway. \n\tAs we noted days ago, Tesla is dealing with increased scrutiny from the NHTSA, who is investigating a number of Autopilot-related accidents involving motorcycles that took place over the summer. The NHTSA is already in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Autopilot/Full Self Driving (updates may come via the company's 10-Q filing, instead of the conference call, if any less than stellar developments have occurred). \n\tThe status of the company's Shanghai plant, which was recently reported to be running under maximum capacity at the end of September. The plant will be running \"at about 93% of capacity through the end of year,\" Reuters reported in late September. The pace is despite the fact that the factory was recently upgraded to handle more production. The factory is capable of producing 14,000 Model Ys and 8,000 Model 3s per week. The company's target is 20,500 units a week for the rest of the year, the sources told Reuters. \n\tThe status of Germany, where Tesla has said that it is seeking to double vehicle sales in the country to 80,000 this year. \nThe call comes following Tesla's disappointing \"AI Day\", in which it revealed its \"Optimus\" humanoid robot. While the sell side might still be sticking with Musk, AI and robotics professionals had a different take on the company's robot reveal. \n\nAI researcher Filip Piekniewski called the robots \"next level cringe-worthy\" and a \"complete and utter scam\" on Twitter. It would be \"good to test falling, as this thing will be falling a lot,\" he said. \n\n\n\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. What they've shown was a lame robotic demo and they bragged about 'solving' what everyone in the field already 'solved' years ago, and didn't mention a word about any actual progress in solving the stuff nobody yet solved,\" he continued. \n\n\n\"Feels very 101. None of this is cutting edge,\" tweeted robotics expert Cynthia Yeung. \"Hire some PhDs and go to some robotics conferences Tesla.\"\n\nHere's where analysts stand into tonight's report:\n\nWedbush (outperform, PT $360)\n\tTesla’s 3Q deliveries came up short and its “likely logistics driven more than demand concerns”\n\t\t“Clearly Tesla had some delivery challenges in the quarter with some isolated soft spots in China”\n\t\n\tCannaccord (buy, PT $304)\n\tProduction was materially greater than deliveries, the largest difference over the last 15 quarters on absolute basis\n\t\tTrust Tesla’s explanation that the gap between production and deliveries is due to logistical issues related to end-of- the-quarter deliveries\n\t\n\tOppenheimer (outperform)\n\tTSLA 3Q22 deliveries missed expectations as the firm “transitioned to a new regional delivery system”\n\t\tThere might be some “incremental downward pressure on shares with these results” but would be “buyers on weakness”\n\t\n\tCowen (market perform, PT $244)\n\tThere could be early signs of a demand issue and will need to track monthly registrations and 4Q results “to better assess the situation”\n\t\tTSLA 3Q delivery figures missed estimates as more vehicles were in transit as production beats expectations\n\t\n\tMorgan Stanley (overweight, PT $383)\n\tIt is unlikely Tesla will compensate for the full-year shortfall fully in 4Q\n\t\t“Combined with a mostly non-event AI day, we’d expect shares to give back recent relative strength”\n\t\n\tJPMorgan (underweight, PT $153 from $137)\n\tWhile Tesla continues to point to supply constraints as limiting deliveries, the potential for demand destruction looms large given the price increases\n\t\n\n      Tyler Durden\nWed, 10/19/2022 - 14:21",

      "description": "Tesla slipped today following disclosure of another stock sale from CEO Elon Musk, with the shares now down nearly 49% year to date.",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) slipped today following disclosure of another stock sale from CEO Elon Musk, with the shares now down nearly 49% year to date.\n\nIn a filing submitted with the SEC on Tuesday, Musk declared he sold around 19,500,000 shares over the course of three days in November, worth around $3.95 billion.\n\nThe latest sale comes only a few days after Musk closed his deal to buy Twitter on October 27, in a deal worth $44 billion.\n\nIt is unclear how much outside equity and personal money Musk has pledged for buying Twitter, though it is known $13 billion in debt financing was raised.\n\nThe latest Tesla sale from Musk this week follows two other disclosures that came after he announced his unsolicited bid to acquire Twitter on April 14.\n\nOn April 28, Musk declared in a filing that he sold around 9.7 million shares of Tesla worth around $8.35 billion. After Twitter sued Musk on July 12 to force him to complete the deal, Musk sold more shares on August 9, worth around $6.8 billion, claiming he needed to raise the funds in case he lost the lawsuit, and had to buy Twitter. Musk had previously said he wouldn't sell any more Tesla shares.\n\nFor analysts and investors, the latest share sale is unwelcome news, since Musk’s deal to buy Twitter (and ensuing stock sales, as well as the threat of more stock sales) has been an overhang on the stock.\n\n“Our fear heading into the final days of the deal was that Musk was going to be forced to sell more Tesla stock to fund the disaster Twitter deal and ultimately those fears came true which speaks to some of the massive selling pressures on the stock of late,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives said in a note published today.\n\nTesla’s stock performance has also been hit by factors like a potential slowdown in China, which Musk admitted may be in the middle of a slowdown, as well concerns over demand weakening in U.S., as well as larger macro concerns over the global economy. New competition from the likes of traditional automakers like Volkswagen, GM, and Ford threatens the strong EV lead Tesla has in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nFor Ives and investors, a focused Musk at the helm of Tesla is crucial right now during this uncertain time. Though Ives didn’t cut his rating or price target on Tesla, he was unequivocal in his displeasure, stating that the “Twitter madness needs to end now,” and Musk needs to focus more on Tesla, otherwise “investor frustration” would continue to build.\n\nAs for Musk’s Tesla holdings, according to his latest SEC filing he still owns over 445 million shares of Tesla, which is a 14% stake in the company. And although Musk is still the world's richest person, his personal fortune has sunk to $179.5 billion from a high of $340 billion following Tesla’s stock decline, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The transactions took place between Monday and Wednesday this week according to the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk told his millions of followers on social media that he had \"no further TSLA sales planned\" after April 28.\n\nHowever, he continued to sell portions of his sizable holdings in Tesla after agreeing to buy Twitter in a deal worth around $44 billion. The acquisition closed in late October. Musk, who is also CEO of SpaceX, a major defense contractor, immediately appointed himself CEO of the social media company.\n\nAfter Musk's Twitter takeover, he told employees there that he sold Tesla shares to \"save\" their business.\n\nTesla shares have been declining this year, and sliding even further since he took on that new responsibility.\n\nShares of Tesla closed down 2.6% on Wednesday at $156.80, dropping the company's market capitalization to $495 billion. Tesla shares were down 55% year-to-date as of Wednesday's close.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",

      "description": "The fragile world stock market rally of the past week has been sideswiped by soaring bond yields, a pothole in the earnings season, Japan's plummeting yen and fresh chaos at the top of Britain's government.",
      "content": "Looking ahead to U.S. and global markets, here is Reuters' take:\n\n \n\n The fragile world stock market rally of the past week has been sideswiped by soaring bond yields, a pothole in the earnings season, Japan's plummeting yen and fresh chaos at the top of Britain's government.\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla threw a curve ball into an otherwise bright start to the third-quarter corporate earnings period and its stock dived almost 6% after the bell on Wednesday after it said it will miss its annual 2022 delivery target. Tesla futures (TSLA) were down 5% at 6:45 a.m. EST. The latest European tech sector earnings on Thursday were downbeat, too.\n\nBut soaring U.S. Treasury borrowing costs — where 3-, 10- and 30-year yields hit 15-, 14- and 11- year highs above 4% respectively — were an even bigger dampener.\n\nAsian and European stocks were lower on Thursday, with U.S. stock futures in the red.\n\nEven though some analysts clung to nods from the Federal Reserve that it might ease its rate rise campaign some time next year, the expected peak 'terminal' rate for the Fed's main policy rate has now closed in on 5%.\n\nUnsettled bond markets appeared to ignore the Fed's Beige Book of economic conditions that indicated inflation pressures may be easing at last. And they also seem to bypass a comment from Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari that his \"best guess\" was inflation pressures level off soon and allow the Fed to pause rate rises \"some time next year.\"\n\nYet as Treasury yields soared, the Bank of Japan on Thursday doubled down on its government bond yield cap - pushing the premium on U.S. Treasuries over JGBs ever wider and the sending the yen plummeting to 150 per dollar for the first time since 1990. Japanese policymakers' repeated threats of intervention to address excessive currency market volatility, but no action to stop the slide was seen so far.\n\nThe unfolding chaos at the top of UK government worsened, meantime. UK interior minister Suella Braverman quit late on Wednesday amid chaotic scenes within the ruling Conservative Party and mounting pressure on Prime Minister Liz Truss to stand down after less than two months in the job.\n\nEven though battered British bonds have recovered some of their footing from the disastrous mini-budget last month, the pound was on the wane again. Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the BoE would respond to changes in Truss's tax and spending policies.\n\n \n\n \"Whether official interest rates have to rise by quite as much as currently priced in financial markets remains to be seen,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n\n \n\n * European Union summit in Brussels\n\n \n\n * U.S. Oct Philadelphia business index. U.S. Sept existing home sales, U.S. weekly jobless claims\n\n \n\n * U.S. corporate earnings: American Airlines, AT&T, Dow, Danaher, Whirlpool, CSX, Union Pacific, Marsh & McLennan, Nucor, Fifth Third Bancorp, SVP Financial, Dover, Pool, Quest Diagnostics, Freeport-McMoRan, Tractor Supply, Genuine Parts, Robert Half\n\n \n\n * U.S. Federal Reserve Board Governor Philip Jefferson, Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook, Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman, Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker all speak\n\n \n\n * Turkey central bank policy decision\n\n \n\n * European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks in Frankfurt, Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernández de Cos speaks in Madrid",

      "content": "Starbucks (SBUX): The coffee giant increased its quarterly dividend to 53 cents per share from 49 cents, effective November 25, 2022 to shareholders on record November 11, 2022. Starbucks initiated its dividend in 2010 and has increased it every year since.\n\nVail Resorts (MTN): The company’s loss narrowed in its fiscal fourth quarter and sales topped Wall Street’s expectations, sending shares higher in extended trading. Revenue for the quarter totaled $267.1 million, up 31% from a year ago. CEO Kirsten Lynch highlighted labor shortages as an issue for the company in its most recent quarter, writing in the earnings release “our ancillary businesses continued to be capacity constrained by staffing” during Vail’s North American ski season.\n\nTesla (TSLA): Tesla appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia as an independent member to its board of directors, three months after Oracle chair Larry Ellison stepped down. Gebbia spent 14 years with Airbnb before stepping back from his full-time role in July.\n\nClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platform\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android",

      "content": "Tesla stock is set to close 2022 at a $700 billion loss since the start of January, marking the worst ever year for the world’s most valuable automaker.\n\nThe share price of the electric car firm crashed to its lowest level since August 2020 this week amid fears about production delays in China, as well as concerns that CEO Elon Musk has been distracted by his recent purchase of Twitter.\n\nThe losses leave the electric car maker’s market cap below $350 billion, having been valued above $1.23 trillion just over one year ago. To put this in context, this loss is more than the combined value of all other car makers globally.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, Tesla’s share price fell by more than $16, representing nearly $52 billion in market cap – more than Mr Musk paid for Twitter in October.\n\nThe extent of the capitulation has also pushed Tesla out of the top 10 most valuable companies, while also stripping Mr Musk of the title of world’s richest person due to the amount of equity he retains in the company.\n\nThe losses have even led some investors and market analysts to speculate that Mr Musk will be forced into a margin call.\n\n“Not much left before Elon gets margin called and the stock goes into a death spiral,” wrote US entrepreneur and investor William LeGate on Twitter. “Investors are scrambling to get out while they still can.”\n\nThe latest losses follow news that Tesla’s Shanghai factory will be forced to reduce production in 2023, having already slowed its output in 2022 due to Covid restrictions and lockdowns in China. Other bad news for the world’s biggest car manufacturer includes a new law in California that will ban Tesla from advertising its vehicles as ‘fully self-driving’.\n\n“Mr Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm,” Webush tech analyst Dan Ives wrote in his latest newsletter. “Instead Musk is laser-focused on Twitter which has been an ongoing nightmare that never ends for investors.”\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from Tesla.\n\nMr Musk, who has sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla share this year to finance his takeover of Twitter, claimed earlier this month that the losses could be attributed to external factors.\n\n“In simple terms: As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop,” he tweeted.\n\nTesla’s losses in 2022 are more than double that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is down roughly 34 per cent.",

But lo, the Biden Administration is coming to Mr. Musk’s aid with a new plan to use the renewable fuel program in a way that subsidizes Teslas and other already subsidized EVs.\n\nCongress’s ethanol mandate offers a case study in the political difficulty of weaning industries off government support—and how regulators can revamp programs to serve new political ends. Politicians of both parties rallied around the renewable fuel standard (RFS) in 2005 as a way to boost U.S. energy independence and reduce CO2 emissions. It has done the opposite.",

Politicians of both parties rallied around the renewable fuel standard (RFS) in 2005 as a way to boost U.S. energy independence and reduce CO2 emissions.",

      "content": "SARASOTA, FL — Tesla plans to expand its presence in Sarasota by building a 55,000-square-foot facility in the University Town Center area, just off I-75, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported.\n\nThe company, run by investor and CEO Elon Musk, already operates a showroom in the Mall at University Town Center and a service center at 5231 McIntosh Road. Tesla also recently announced that it will build a new regional service center in Fort Myers to assist its electric car customers in Collier, Lee and Charlotte counties, according to the News-Press.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, there were more than 60,000 light-duty electric vehicles registered in the Sunshine State, according to data from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. In a survey of electric vehicle owners that year, 26 percent of respondents were from the West Central region of Florida, which includes Sarasota and Manatee counties.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, there were just over 58,000 electric vehicles registered in Florida — the state with the second-highest amount, just behind California, which had 425,000 EVS registered, Inside EVs reported. That number appears to have increased since then, with nearly 96,000 EVs registered in Florida as of December 2021, the Herald-Tribune reported.\n\nIt’s a number that will likely just get bigger. Florida Power and Light has estimated that the number of electric vehicles in its service area could increase to nearly 600,000 by 2030, according to WUSF.",

The company also laid off 6% of its workforce and saw a slew of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company artificially inflated its share price and underpriced its cars.\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, the company saw a 47% increase in car deliveries in its third quarter compared to its second quarter.\n\nHowever, analyst estimates show Rivian registered more than $3 billion in losses during the first half of 2022, Markets Insider reported.",

      "content": "A Tesla model 3 car is seen in their showroom in Singapore October 22, 2021. REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nA look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.\n\nThe fragile world stock market rally of the past week has been sideswiped by soaring bond yields, a pothole in the earnings season, Japan's plummeting yen and fresh chaos at the top of Britain's government.\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA.O) threw a curve ball into an otherwise bright start to the third-quarter corporate earnings period and its stock dived almost 6% after the bell on Wednesday after it said it will miss its annual 2022 delivery target. read more The latest European tech sector earnings on Thursday were downbeat, too. read more\n\nBut soaring U.S. Treasury borrowing costs -- where 3-, 10- and 30-year yields hit 15-, 14- and 11- year highs above 4% respectively -- were an even bigger dampener.\n\nAsian and European stocks were lower on Thursday, with U.S. stock futures in the red.\n\nEven though some analysts clung to nods from the Federal Reserve that it might ease its rate rise campaign some time next year, the expected peak 'terminal' rate for the Fed's main policy rate has now closed in on 5%.\n\nUnsettled bond markets appeared to ignore the Fed's Beige Book of economic conditions that indicated inflation pressures may be easing at last. And they also seem to bypass a comment from Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari that his \"best guess\" was inflation pressures level off soon and allow the Fed to pause rate rises \"some time next year.\" read more read more\n\nYet as Treasury yields soared, the Bank of Japan on Thursday doubled down on its government bond yield cap - pushing the premium on U.S. Treasuries over JGBs ever wider and the sending the yen plummeting to 150 per dollar for the first time since 1990. Japanese policymakers' repeated threats of intervention to address excessive currency market volatility, but no action to stop the slide was seen so far. read more\n\nThe unfolding chaos at the top of UK government worsened, meantime. UK interior minister Suella Braverman quit late on Wednesday amid chaotic scenes within the ruling Conservative Party and mounting pressure on Prime Minister Liz Truss to stand down after less than 2 months in the job. read more\n\nEven though battered British bonds have recovered some of their footing from the disastrous mini-budget last month, the pound was on the wane again. Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the BoE would respond to changes in Truss's tax and spending policies. \"Whether official interest rates have to rise by quite as much as currently priced in financial markets remains to be seen,\" he said. read more\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n\n* U.S. Oct Philadelphia business index. U.S. Sept existing home sales, U.S. weekly jobless claims\n\n* U.S. corp earnings: American Airlines, AT&T, Dow, Danaher, Whirlpool, CSX, Union Pacific, Marsh & McLennan, Nucor, Fifth Third Bancorp, SVP Financial, Dover, Pool, Quest Diagnostics, Freeport-McMoRan, Tractor Supply, Genuine Parts, Robert Half\n\n* European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks in Frankfurt, Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernández de Cos speaks in Madrid",

      "content": "LONDON (AP) — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nBMW investing $1.7B in S Carolina as automaker shifts to EVs\n\nGREER, S.C. (AP) — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nStocks lose ground as more earnings roll in; yields rise\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nTesla 3Q profit more than doubles from a year ago to $3.29B\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nUS awards $2.8B in grants for EV batteries in 12 states\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 24.82 points, or 0.7%, to 3,695.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 99.99 points, or 0.3%, to 30,423.81. The Nasdaq fell 91.89 points, or 0.9%, to 10,680.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies shed 30.20 points, or 1.7%, to 1,725.76.",

      "content": "LONDON (AP) — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nBMW investing $1.7B in S Carolina as automaker shifts to EVs\n\nGREER, S.C. (AP) — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nStocks lose ground as more earnings roll in; yields rise\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nTesla 3Q profit more than doubles from a year ago to $3.29B\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nUS awards $2.8B in grants for EV batteries in 12 states\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 24.82 points, or 0.7%, to 3,695.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 99.99 points, or 0.3%, to 30,423.81. The Nasdaq fell 91.89 points, or 0.9%, to 10,680.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies shed 30.20 points, or 1.7%, to 1,725.76.",

      "content": "LONDON — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nGREER, S.C. — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nNEW YORK — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nDETROIT — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.",

      "content": "LONDON (AP) — British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation’s poorest residents. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6% in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs. That pushed consumer price inflation back to 10.1%, the highest since early 1982 and equal to the level last reached in July. The figures fueled demands that the government do more to help families and retirees as it struggles to regain credibility after an ill-fated package of tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n\nBMW investing $1.7B in S Carolina as automaker shifts to EVs\n\nGREER, S.C. (AP) — BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start producing electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years.\n\nStocks lose ground as more earnings roll in; yields rise\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, reversing course after two days of gains. Major indexes are still higher for the week despite the declines, which pulled every sector lower except energy. Treasury yields continue to climb to multiyear highs, tempting investors with higher returns on relatively low-risk investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose above 4.5% and is at its highest level since August 2007. Several companies fell after reporting disappointing results including generator maker Generac and M&T Bank. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Dow lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market.\n\nTesla 3Q profit more than doubles from a year ago to $3.29B\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Tesla has reported that its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, fueled by higher vehicle sales. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle and solar panel maker said it made $3.29 billion from July through September. Revenue rose 56% to a record $21.45 billion. But it fell just short of estimates averaging $21.98 billion. Tesla stuck with its prediction of 50% annual vehicle sales growth over the next few years, confident that demand will remain strong. But it will take a stellar fourth-quarter sales performance to reach the 50% goal. Analysts have questioned whether Tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles, which in the U.S. start around $49,000.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is telling voters that he hasn’t given up on lowering gasoline prices. Biden says he has ordered the release of 15 million barrels from the U.S. strategic reserve and will consider additional withdrawals this winter. It’s a message with clear political implications as the president’s approval rating has moved in the opposite direction from changes in gasoline prices. Wednesday’s announcement completes the release of 180 million barrels authorized by Biden in March. The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil. That’s the lowest level since 1984. And Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio say that the releases are about helping Democrats in midterm elections.\n\nUS awards $2.8B in grants for EV batteries in 12 states\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday awarded $2.8 billion in grants to build and expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles in 12 states. A total of 20 companies will receive grants for projects to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components and strengthen U.S. supply of critical minerals. The announcement comes as the administration seeks to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of President Joe Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing. A sweeping climate and health-care law passed in August includes several provisions to boost electric vehicles, including tax credits for EV buyers worth up to $7,500.\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to massively expand the country’s charging network for electric cars. It plans to spend 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn from combustion cars to more climate-friendly electric vehicles. The country’s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a “master plan” for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ cabinet. In order to boost the number of charging points, the government will provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging points can be build. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars. overnight.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Spirit Airlines shareholders approved a $3.8 billion sale of the company to JetBlue Airways. Spirit announced the results on Wednesday. JetBlue was able to drive out rival bidder Frontier Airlines after a bidding war this year. Even with Spirit shareholders accepting the buyout, the deal could face a big challenge from federal antitrust regulators. They appear to oppose any further consolidation in the airline industry after a round of mergers between 2005 and 2016. The Justice Department is already in court fighting against a partnership between JetBlue and American, which the government says is anti-competitive.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 24.82 points, or 0.7%, to 3,695.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 99.99 points, or 0.3%, to 30,423.81. The Nasdaq fell 91.89 points, or 0.9%, to 10,680.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies shed 30.20 points, or 1.7%, to 1,725.76.",

The recall covers 2023 Model 3 sedans, as well as Model Y crossovers for model years 2020 through 2023.\n\nTesla estimated that the problem affects 1% of the vehicles under recall and said it will release a software update to address the “firmware anomaly.” Vehicles in production received the update starting November 6, according to a filing with the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nOn Friday, Tesla recalled 30,000 Model X SUVs due to a problem with the front passenger airbag.\n\nThe EV maker has issued 19 recalls in the U.S. so far this year, according to data from the DOT. The vast majority of those have been resolved with an over-the-air software update. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled more than 40,000 Model X and Model S sedans over a software issue that could affect power steering when driving over potholes, and another 53 vehicles due to faulty installation of side view mirrors.\n\nIn August, consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recall Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) technology from its vehicles, calling it “one of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades.”",

      "title": "Tesla Is Down Bad Right Now",
      "description": "The company has lost more than $500 billion off its market cap since Elon Musk announced his Twitter purchase.",
      "content": "Elon Musk’s debt-laden purchase of Twitter has been a bit of a mess — good for users who enjoy the chaos of a tanking platform, bad for the advertisers underwriting the thing and the thousands of its employees forced out by layoffs or absurd working conditions. But if you think Musk’s biggest current problems lie in getting the blue bird under his control, you’re forgetting about the scale of his chief business.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April. A few weeks before the purchase, his electric-car company, Tesla, had a market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion. After a stock sell-off this week, one of many since the spring, Tesla is now valued at $527 billion. Because Musk owns roughly a quarter of the company, he has now lost $101 billion of his net worth this year alone. For those keeping score, that’s the value of more than two Twitter purchases. If the stock price keeps plummeting, Musk could soon lose his status as the world’s richest man.\n\nWhy is Tesla down so bad? One reason may be that traders fear Musk is too distracted by all the “dumb things” he promises to do at Twitter to effectively run a company with a higher market cap than Exxon Mobil. There’s the crummy market, of course. But there are also more tangible problems: Supply costs are up because of now-familiar problems, like supply-chain backups and China’s zero-COVID policy. Sales have been falling short of estimates because of inflation and rising interest rates bearing down on consumers. And Tesla’s lucrative sale of regulatory credits is also down, as other car companies break into the market.\n\nThen there are the recalls. This week, Tesla announced a recall of 321,000 Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs, owing to tail lights that “intermittently illuminate.” In plainer language, they go off when they’re not supposed to. That comes on the heels of another recall involving 30,000 Model X luxury sedans, whose passenger airbags had the potential to deploy in minor collisions, when they weren’t supposed to. Now, those aren’t killers on their own: Both can be solved fairly easily by software patches. But there have been 17 other recalls this year — a concerning record for a company that is requesting takedowns of videos showing Teslas running over child mannequins.\n\nMoving forward, Tesla could also take a hit if fit fails to meet its manufacturing targets for this year. Musk promised Tesla would build 1.5 million cars in 2022, but as of the end of the third quarter, it had built only 929,910. It will need to finish 570,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, at a rate of more than 6,300 per day, or risk another stock dive.\n\nA company losing more than half its valuation within a calendar year is pretty rough. But Tesla has a major debut coming up on December 1, when it delivers its long-awaited Semi model, selling the first round of the tractor-trailers to Pepsi. The first-ever electric long-haul truck, with a 500-mile range, could be a major boost for the company — assuming everything goes right this time.",

And Tesla’s lucrative sale of regulatory credits is also down, as other car companies break into the market.\n\nThen there are the recalls. This week, Tesla announced a recall of 321,000 Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs, owing to tail lights that “intermittently illuminate.” That comes on the heels of another recall involving 30,000 Model X luxury sedans, whose passenger airbags had the potential to deploy in minor collisions, when they weren’t supposed to.",

The slump is painful for a broad swath of investors: The company is the sixth-biggest member of the S&P 500 Index as of Wednesday’s close. It’s been the third-largest drag this year on the benchmark, which Tesla joined two years ago next week.\n\nTesla shares have been battered by angst over a potential recession and the Federal Reserve’s move to hike interest rates, which have prompted investors to dump risky and expensive stocks, sparking an intense selloff in technology and growth assets in particular.\n\nOn top of that, the company’s own troubles, including supply shortages, soaring raw material costs and production disruptions, as well as Elon Musk’s preoccupation with turning around newly acquired Twitter Inc., have all weighed heavily on the stock. Musk has been dethroned as the world’s richest person because of the slide.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook for next year is darkening as well. On Wednesday, at least two Wall Street analysts struck a cautious note on Tesla and the electric-vehicle sector overall. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered estimates to reflect “softer” supply and demand, while Morgan Stanley warned that the brakes were “screeching on electric vehicle demand,” and cut its projections for adoption in the US.\n\nWhile Tesla shares have largely been sliding the whole year, the drop has intensified in the past couple months, with the stock falling 41% since the end of September. The broader S&P 500 Index has advanced 11% in the same period, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 gained 7%.\n• None AmEx Hooked Big Spenders and Regained the Throne With a Pricier Platinum Card\n• None TikTok’s Problem Child Has 7 Million Followers and One Proud Mom\n• None The FUD Behind the Crypto Collapse",

      "description": "More than 20 tornadoes struck Louisiana within 24 hours on Wednesday, killing three and injuring at least six.",
      "content": "A Tesla's camera captured footage from inside a tornado that struck Louisiana, killing at least three and toppling over a semi-truck.\n\nA Tesla sitting outside a Gretna home captured the moment an EF-2 hit the town close to New Orleans, with strong winds and heavy rainfall.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the cameras become obscured by the circular wind and several angles show a flash of lights and debris as the tornado rolled through. The once clean roadway became littered with broken wood and the truck across the street turned over.\n\nOverhead footage, captured by Fox 8 Live, showed the house across the street with its roof entirely ripped off, leaving behind a mess of debris. The home next to it also appears to have it's roof ripped off, but the surrounding homes were left with minimal damage.\n\nA total of 21 tornados hit the state within 24 hours on Wednesday, and at least six were injured and three people are dead following the twisters. A grandmother, Allison Alexander, 56, lost her life when a tornado ripped through her home.\n\nThe deadly twister struck Killona and tore apart her mobile home, Nola.com reported. Alexander's body was found under a pile of debris in her neighbor's driveway with serious head injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nAlexander's grandsons, four and nine, and her sister Yvette Raymond, 53, were also injured during the twister. The nine-year-old suffered a broken leg and was hospitalized.\n\nHer other family members - a 10-year-old grandson, two other boys, and a male friend - were also inside the home during the event, but were not injured.\n\nThe only part of Alexander's home left standing was the metal frame the mobile home sat on.\n\nHer family and friends remembered her as a positive soul that could talk to just about anyone.\n\n'I'd say: \"You know that person?\" And she'd say: \"No, I just met them.\"' her niece Ashanty Raymond, 27, told Nola.com.\n\nHer neighbor Anthony White, 44, remembered her as being 'so nice.' He said: 'She always had a smile on her face.'\n\nThe grandmother was born and raised in Killona and was the second oldest of six children, Nola.com reported.\n\nShe worked as a hair stylist at her niece's salon and was known as Tee Tanka to friends.\n\n'She had a bright aura about her. She never had a bad day,' her daughter Keonsha Alexander, 27, told Nola.com.\n\nHer sister Yvette said Alexander 'would do anything for anyone,' despite having limited means herself.\n\nThe family set up a GoFundMe page to help rehabilitate after the tragedy. It has raised more than $5,000 of its $20,000 goal, as of Friday morning.",

      "description": "Bloomberg's Bailey Lipschultz joins Caroline Hyde to discuss Elon Musk offloading another $3.6 billion of Tesla shares, after he said he was done getting rid of Tesla stock. (Source: Bloomberg)",
      "content": "It's interesting media course. We were just wondering why it was under pressure. Many feeling perhaps the retail investor, which is such an important buyer for Tesla, was a little bit worried about his destruction, about his recent other purchases. But now it seems we made clear that maybe the selling pressure is coming from him himself. Exactly. When you look at where the market was trading Monday and Tuesday, broadly moving higher and Tesla, the biggest drag on the S & P 500 and NASDAQ 100 in those two days. Again, this is kind of a bit of sounding an alarm for investors. It's still those concerns about what is you on focused on, where is it headed? Obviously, Space X has been successful. Tesla has been a roaring success. But did he bite off more than he could chew with with Twitter in particular, again, with massive debt loads? How does that impact the fundamental business of Tesla? Again, given how large of a stake he has in whether or not he's going to continue to sell shares, as you mentioned at the top of the hour that he did say earlier in the year that he was done selling and then three and half billion is not done selling. What's so interesting, we're just talking with Katie about a real macro feel to these markets, the fact that the Federal Reserve often is the only game in town. Now, you know, Musk himself can be a bit of a macroeconomic commentator. And he sort of made a few, shall we say, trails breadcrumbs for us, saying, look, you should be worried about debt right now. If you're seeing the rates go up from the Fed, we're not his debt. We're not Twitter's debt. Well, that's the thing. And that's kind of to your point. Interest rates are going higher. When you look at Twitter, when you look at that take out, that does come with massive debt load. That does come with pretty high interest rates that are going to continue to need to be paid. So that's the main question is, is Iran selling these shares to buy some of that debt? Is he doing it to invest more in Twitter? Is he doing that to, you know, help cover some of those interest payments? No one really knows that. I don't think anyone really kind of understands what he was doing other than Elan. But there are so many questions just given how tied these companies can be, given where they are right now and where they're trading. And again, with this selling pressure that we've seen so far this week for Tesla stock in particular.",
