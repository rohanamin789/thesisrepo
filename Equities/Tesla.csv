('Tesla') to supply the U.S. automaker with spodumene concentrate ('SC6') from North American Lithium ('NAL').

Piedmont and Tesla have mutually agreed to amend their previous offtake agreement with the terms of this new agreement, which are binding for a three-year term and include an option to renew for another three years. Under the amended agreement, Piedmont has agreed to deliver approximately 125,000 metric tons of SC6 to Tesla beginning in H2 2023 through the end of 2025.

According to the terms, the SC6 pricing will be determined by a formula-based mechanism linked to average market prices for lithium hydroxide monohydrate throughout the term of the agreement. The pricing received by Piedmont under the agreement with Tesla will be determined by market prices at the time of each shipment.

'We are pleased to be able to partner with Tesla to supply lithium resources produced in North America,' said Piedmont Lithium President and CEO Keith Phillips. 'The electric vehicle and critical battery materials landscape has changed significantly since 2020 and this agreement reflects the importance of – and growing demand for – a North American lithium supply chain. This agreement helps to ensure that these critical resources from Quebec remain in North America and support the mission of the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster the U.S. supply chain, the clean energy economy, and global decarbonization.'

Spodumene concentrate production is expected to restart at NAL in H1 2023, with first commercial shipments expected to begin in Q3 2023. Piedmont plans to deliver SC6 to Tesla from NAL under Piedmont's offtake agreement with Sayona Quebec, which entitles Piedmont to purchase the greater of 113,000 metric tons per year or 50% of SC6 production. Piedmont's purchases of SC6 from Sayona Quebec are subject to floor and ceiling prices for the life-of-mine term.

2,The Fall Of Tesla And The Rise of Exxon Amid The Energy Crisis,Editor OilPrice.com,2023-01-01 00:00:00,date,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fall-tesla-rise-exxon-amid-000000565.html,yahoo.com,"Growth stocks have been thoroughly hammered this year, with high inflation and rising interest rates pinching growth equities of all stripes. But few stocks exemplify the dramatic shake-up at the top,…","Growth stocks have been thoroughly hammered this year, with high inflation and rising interest rates pinching growth equities of all stripes. But few stocks exemplify the dramatic shake-up at the top, like leading EV maker Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). TSLA stock has tanked 69.5% in the year-to-date, wiping off a staggering $877 billion from its market cap. In comparison, the S&P 500 has declined a more modest 19.7% over the timeframe. Tesla has gone from being the fifth most valuable public company and now ranks just thirteenth with a market cap of $385 billion.
Tesla's woes are well documented, including Musk's Twitter takeover and related distractions; worries that high inflation and rising interest rates will dampen consumers' enthusiasm for EVs, as well as investor jitters about growth assets. TSLA shareholders are furious at CEO Elon Musk, The Wall Street Journal reports, for his Twitter antics and tomfoolery, which has led to several downgrades for the stock. Meanwhile, hordes of customers are canceling their Tesla orders, ""His personality is absolutely tanking the Tesla brand. I'm looking forward to having an Elon-free existence,'' a biotech exec with a Model S lease has told CNET. ""There is no Tesla CEO today,"" tweeted Gary Black, a hedge fund manager with ~$50 million worth of TSLA stock told Futurism.

But Tesla is hardly alone here: most EV stocks have had a year to forget with rising costs, supply chain issues, increasing competition, and the threat of a potential recession causing many to sell off heavily.
Surprisingly, some Wall Street pundits have not given up on TSLA stock and are urging investors to use the selloff as a buying opportunity. To wit, Citi has tapped TSLA as a bullish contrarian stock for 2023, while Baird analyst Ben Kallo still sees Tesla as a 'Best Idea' stock in 2023. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley says Tesla could extend its lead over its EV rivals in the coming year, and has cited 'valuation, cash flow, innovation and cost leadership' as key reasons to maintain a Buy-equivalent rating. Meanwhile, famed contrarian investor Cathie Wood, known for betting big on former growth stocks as they fall, recently loaded up on more than 25K shares of the EV giant.
In sharp contrast, things could not have gone differently for Tesla's biggest fossil fuel rival, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM). Exxon Mobil has enjoyed the biggest rise in the S&P 500 this year, with the energy giant jumping almost like technology stocks did in the tech boom thanks to high oil and gas prices triggered by the energy crisis. XOM shares have soared 72% this year, adding $190 billion to the company's market value. Exxon's increase in market value surpasses any company in the S&P 500, making Exxon Mobil the eighth most valuable stock in the S&P 500. That's a remarkable jump considering that it only ranked 27th most valuable in the S&P 500 a year ago. Exxon was the most valuable S&P 500 company in 2011 until Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) surpassed it in 2012.
Whereas Citi has picked XOM as one of its bearish contrarian stocks for 2023, the stock is viewed favorably by most Wall Street analysts, as evidenced by its $118.89 average price target, good for a 10% upside. The energy sector in general is expected to outperform the market again in 2023, and XOM should be just fine, considering it's still cheap with a PE (Fwd) of 7.9. Back in October, Exxon raised its quarterly dividend by $0.03 per share to $0.91 per share marking the company's 40th straight year of increasing its dividend, keeping it in the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats. XOM shares now yield 3.3%.
The outlook for the energy sector remains bright. According to a recent Moody's research report, industry earnings will stabilize overall in 2023, though they will come in slightly below levels reached by recent peaks.
The analysts note that commodity prices have declined from very high levels earlier in 2022, but have predicted that prices are likely to remain cyclically strong through 2023. This, combined with modest growth in volumes, will support strong cash flow generation for oil and gas producers. Moody's estimates that the U.S. energy sector's EBITDA for 2022 will clock in at $623B but fall slightly to $585B in 2023.
The analysts say that low capex, rising uncertainty about the expansion of future supplies, and high geopolitical risk premium will, however, continue to support cyclically high oil prices. Meanwhile, strong export demand for U.S. LNG will continue supporting high natural gas prices.
The combined dividend and buyback yield for the energy sector is now approaching 8%, which is high by historical standards. Similarly elevated levels occurred in 2020 and 2009, which preceded periods of strength. In comparison, the combined dividend and buyback yield for the S&P 500 is closer to five percent, which makes for one of the largest gaps in favor of the energy sector on record.
In other words, there simply aren't better places for people investing in the U.S. stock market to park their money if they are looking for serious earnings growth.

Swedish company Candela on Thursday unveiled a 28-foot (8.5-meter) electric-powered hydrofoil speedboat that can cruise for over two hours at 20 knots, or about 23 mph. California startup Navier tried to outdo its Scandinavian rival by bringing an electric hydrofoil that's a little bit longer, though Candela is further along in getting its products to customers.

Even the recreational motorboat conglomerate Brunswick Corporation tried to make a splash in Nevada this week by showing off its latest electric outboard motor — an emerging segment of its mostly gas-powered fleet.

WHY ELECTRIC?

A chief reason is environmental, as well as to save on rising fuel costs. But electric-powered boats — particularly with the sleek foiling designs that lift the hull above the water's surface at higher speeds — can also offer a smoother and quieter ride.

'You can have a wine glass and it does not spill,' Navier CEO Sampriti Bhattacharyya told The Associated Press last month. 'And it's quiet, extremely quiet. You can have a conversation, unlike on a gas boat.'

WHEN CAN YOU GET ONE?

Candela CEO Gustav Hasselskog said his company has already sold and manufactured 150 of its brand-new C-8 model. The Stockholm-based startup has been scaling up its workforce from 60 employees a year ago to about 400 later this year as it prepares to ramp up production.

But with a roughly $400,000 price tag, neither the C-8 nor Navier's N30 is aiming to replace the aluminum boat used to fish on the lake. They've been described as Teslas of the sea, with hopes that what starts off as a luxury vehicle could eventually help transform the marine industry.

'They tend to be entrepreneurs,' Hasselskog said of Candela's first customers. 'They tend to be tech enthusiasts, if you like, with an optimistic view about the future and the ability of technology to solve all kinds of societal challenges.'

Navier's investment backers include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, which means he's probably getting one, too.

ARE BOATERS READY FOR THIS?

Probably not. These early electric boat models are expensive, heavy and could instill more serious 'range anxiety' than what drivers have felt about electric cars, said Truist Securities analyst Michael Swartz, who follows the leisure boat industry.

'How safe is it for me to go out in the middle of the week with no one around, miles from shore, in an electric outboard engine?' Swartz said.

Swartz said they might make more sense to use electric motors — such as a new CES offering from Brunswick-owned Mercury Marine — to power a fleet of small rental boats, perhaps at the widely-used boating clubs also run by Brunswick.

'You're not anywhere near the type of electric boat where you can go 50 miles offshore and go fishing for a couple of hours and come back,' Swartz said. 'There's no technology that can enable you to replicate that experience outside of an internal combustion engine.'

BRING ON THE WATER TAXIS?

Both Candela and Navier are planning for a secondary market of electric ferries that could compete with the gas-powered vehicles that now carry commuters around populated regions such as the Stockholm archipelago or along San Francisco Bay.

Hasselskog said the same technology powering Candela's new leisure boat will also be used to power a 30-passenger catamaran prototype that could operate in Sweden by summer.

For a city like Stockholm, which has already electrified most of its public ground transportation, its dozens of large ferry boats are an outlier in producing carbon emissions.

'They need something like 220 of these (electric) vessels to replace the current fleet,' Hasselskog said. And instead of running on fixed schedules with empty seats, the smaller electric vehicles might be able to be summoned on demand such as how Uber or Lyft work on land.

AUTOMATIC DOCKING

Many of the companies developing electric boat propulsion also have teams working on making these vehicles more autonomous. But since most recreational boaters like piloting their own boats — and most ferry passengers likely prefer a human captain at the helm — the self-driving innovation is focused on what happens at the marina.

'There's an intimidation factor with boating and a lot of the intimidation factor you hear from consumers is with docking,' said Swartz, the Truist analyst. 'So if that can be made seamless and automated, it's a huge deal.'",thestar.com,748,news,CA,en,"Matt O'Brien,The Associated Press",https://images.thestar.com/zWBK2FIB10OAtdzhbBCXI7QaGS0=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1673031123787):format(webp)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/life/2023/01/06/teslas-of-the-sea-ces-showcases-electric-hydrofoil-boats/20230106130144-63b86c3cc77666a04d072970jpeg.jpg,False,Matt O'brien,7.4629693,dc587762aff9c0bc00a1fd3f57d7dc0e

7,How To Unlock And Start A Tesla Using The Mobile App,Michael Akuchie,2023-01-02 00:00:13,date,https://screenrant.com/tesla-app-unlock-start-car-how/,screenrant.com,The car and app need a cellular connection.,"The Tesla mobile app enables drivers to manage various aspects of their cars, and it can also be used to lock, unlock, and start a vehicle. Tesla EVs are popular for their technological prowess which have attracted buyers through the years. For example, the automaker's advanced driving assistance/safety systems are considered to be top-level despite the controversies over their viability. Tesla maintains a healthy lead over other vehicle manufacturers in the EV scene, and that's not expected to change in the next few years. Tesla's app can remotely unlock and start all its vehicles – the Model X, Y, S, and 3. The process is identical for each model. For this to work, both the app and EV must be connected to a cellular network. Additionally, mobile access should be activated on the touchscreen. Only then will this function be possible. To do this, users should open the Tesla app and tap 'Controls' followed by 'Unlock'. Selecting 'Yes' on the confirmation popup window instantly unlocks the doors. Starting the EV requires a similar approach. Instead of 'Unlock' after navigating to the 'Controls' section, drivers should tap 'Start'. There's a two-minute window to begin driving after remotely starting the vehicle. When this period elapses, the process has to be restarted. Other Functions Of The Tesla App It's common for automakers to build and design a mobile app which serves as a means to get the most out of one's vehicle ownership. The Kia Connect app, for example, not only helps drivers to remotely access their EVs but also displays useful information like nearby charging stations and available range. Similarly, the Tesla mobile app is also multipurpose. There's a self-diagnostic feature that allows users to verify problems that drivers have already reported. Additionally, the app can be used to schedule service appointments and request roadside assistance ranging from lockouts to flat tires. The app also shares pointers on how drivers can maximize available range. This feature is highly recommended for those driving in snowy weather. It's common knowledge that EVs suffer significant range loss in cold conditions. So, an app that provides helpful information on driving range is a must-have for all Tesla drivers. Vehicle owners can also utilize the app to precondition their cabins and batteries before starting a drive. Away from vehicle management, the app helps users to manage energy products like the Powerwall and Wall Connector. For instance, they can set the Powerwall to act as backup protection during outages. The Tesla app also helps to troubleshoot basic problems with Powerwall and Solar Roof, but it's worth noting that additional assistance may be necessary for serious issues.

After losing $200 billion from his net worth last year, the Tesla CEO was met with the news that the EV company's sales in China dropped off in December, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Tesla sold only about 56,000 cars in the country last month, down 21 percent from the year prior and a whopping 44 percent from November.

Elon Musk Breaks Another Record: First Person to Lose $200 Billion
That's a worrying sign for the company, given that China is the world's largest car market, making up about 40 percent of Tesla's sales. 'When you are not active in the largest market in the world, you are nowhere,' Axel Schmidt, a senior managing director at Accenture overseeing the firm's automotive division, said before the sales numbers were published.
Part of Tesla's decline is due to local competition within China. Companies such as BYD, a domestic automaker and the country's top EV brand, have been gaining market share. In December, BYD sales nearly doubled compared with the year prior, and they were up 2 percent from November, according to data from China's Passenger Car Association cited in the Times. And while the government has promoted EV adoption among the populace, it has recently slashed subsidies that incentivized Chinese buyers to purchase a new EV. That has made carmakers, including Tesla, have to cut prices to compensate for the lack of state-backed stipend.
The worry is that these trends could hurt Tesla more broadly, not just in China. The company's worsening performance in the country has affected its overall share price, which has fell sharply in the past year (with a decline of about 3 percent during Thursday trading). And with BYD and other Chinese car makers moving into the European market, Tesla could start to lose ground there as well.
It's not all bad news, at least: In 2022, Tesla's sales in China rose almost 50 percent overall. Still, that might not be enough to help the company overcome its more recent backslide. In addition to fewer sales, Tesla has also slashed prices for the models made at its Shanghai plant, and wait times for vehicles have shifted from months to as little as a week.
'The major worry now overhead for Tesla is that the demand story, especially out of China, is showing heavy cracks in the armor at a time that EV competition is steadily increasing,' Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients on Wednesday.
Musk sure can't catch a break.

10,"Tesla's Sales in China Are Slipping, as Local Competition Catches Up",Tori Latham,2023-01-06 00:00:00,date,https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/tesla-sales-china-drop-1234791969/,robbreport.com,The EV company is losing ground in a country that makes up 40 percent of its sales.,"Elon Musk's woes continue. After losing $200 billion from his net worth last year, the Tesla CEO was met with the news that the EV company's sales in China dropped off in December, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Tesla sold only about 56,000 cars in the country last month, down 21 percent from the year prior and a whopping 44 percent from November. That's a worrying sign for the company, given that China is the world's largest car market, making up about 40 percent of Tesla's sales. 'When you are not active in the largest market in the world, you are nowhere,' Axel Schmidt, a senior managing director at Accenture overseeing the firm's automotive division, said before the sales numbers were published. Part of Tesla's decline is due to local competition within China. Companies such as BYD, a domestic automaker and the country's top EV brand, have been gaining market share. In December, BYD sales nearly doubled compared with the year prior, and they were up 2 percent from November, according to data from China's Passenger Car Association cited in the Times. And while the government has promoted EV adoption among the populace, it has recently slashed subsidies that incentivized Chinese buyers to purchase a new EV. That has made carmakers, including Tesla, have to cut prices to compensate for the lack of state-backed stipend. The worry is that these trends could hurt Tesla more broadly, not just in China. The company's worsening performance in the country has affected its overall share price, which has fell sharply in the past year (with a decline of about 3 percent during Thursday trading). And with BYD and other Chinese car makers moving into the European market, Tesla could start to lose ground there as well. It's not all bad news, at least: In 2022, Tesla's sales in China rose almost 50 percent overall. Still, that might not be enough to help the company overcome its more recent backslide. In addition to fewer sales, Tesla has also slashed prices for the models made at its Shanghai plant, and wait times for vehicles have shifted from months to as little as a week. 'The major worry now overhead for Tesla is that the demand story, especially out of China, is showing heavy cracks in the armor at a time that EV competition is steadily increasing,' Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients on Wednesday. Musk sure can't catch a break.",robbreport.com,5597,news,US,en,"Manhattan Home Prices Fell,Tori Latham",https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tesla-China.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1,False,@RobbReport,7.033706,c3db1345e0470ffebd0c4e94562dee56

While the total was a quarterly record for Tesla, the company opened two new assembly plants last year and still came up short of its goal to expand deliveries by 50 per cent.After chief executive Elon Musk predicted an 'epic end to the year', Tesla proceeded to cut vehicle prices and production in China, then offered $7,500 discounts in the US. Concerns about rising interest rates, inflation and other economic headwinds — plus alarm over Musk's antics on Twitter, which he now owns — sent Tesla shares plunging 37 per cent in December and 65 per cent last year.'We believe that Tesla is facing a significant demand problem, Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock, wrote in a report Monday. 'We believe Tesla will need to either reduce its growth targets (and run its factories below capacity) or sustain and potentially increase recent price cuts globally, pressuring margins.Tesla increased deliveries by 40 per cent to 1.31 million last year, shy of the 50 per cent average annual growth rate the company has said it expects to achieve over multiple years. Production expanded 47 per cent to 1.37 million.The company produced 439,701 vehicles in the fourth quarter, exceeding deliveries by 34,423 units. Tesla said that it continued to transition to 'a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, which led to another increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter.'Tesla sells cars, and the auto industry is slowing down, Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, said by phone. 'They are still struggling with logistics, and the gap between production and deliveries grew from the last quarter.Tesla's quarterly delivery figures are widely seen as a barometer for EV demand generally, since the Austin, Texas-based company has led the charge for battery-powered cars.The company has a long tradition of going all-out at the end of each quarter to get cars into the hands of customers, with top executives like design chief Franz von Holzhausen helping out at a southern California delivery centre on New Year's Eve.Tesla doesn't break out sales by region, but the US and China are its largest markets, and 95 per cent of sales in 2022 were of the Model 3 sedan and Y crossover.The company makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y at its factory in Fremont, California. Its Shanghai plant produces the Model 3 and Y, and it started delivering Model Ys from its newest plants in Austin and near Berlin in the first half of last year.While Musk handed over Tesla's first Semi trucks to PepsiCo in December, the company didn't report any deliveries of the model in its quarterly statement. The carmaker announced separately that it's scheduled an investor day for March 1st, where it will discuss long-term expansion plans, a next-generation vehicle platform, capital allocation and other subjects. – Bloomberg",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/TT0RtquK04SkzEkJ8N3omR5uLpU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/QGSN326E7IHCBY4MSKNMOF5AA4.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.873491,75827dc545a1e5ec1e3447ace2ad2829

16,Life after Elon Musk? Tesla's board takes heat over succession planning,Dana Hull,2023-01-06 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com/business/2023/01/05/life-after-elon-musk-teslas-board-takes-heat-over-succession-planning.html,thestar.com,Shareholders push for key-person risk report and say company has been evasive,"Tesla Inc.'s board of directors is facing mounting pressure to prove just how prepared they are for the potential loss of Elon Musk, the erratic chief executive officer largely behind the breakneck rise and dramatic fall in the company's valuation.

Karen Róbertsdóttir, a shareholder in Reykjavik, Iceland, has submitted a resolution for Tesla investors to vote in May on whether the board should prepare and maintain a key-person risk report. Several other shareholders who wanted to put forward proposals — at least one of which also pertained to Musk — are frustrated with how the company disclosed plans to hold its annual meeting months earlier than in recent years, sparing the directors from even more heat.

If Róbertsdóttir's motion makes it onto Tesla's proxy, it will give investors a tangible way to force Tesla to be more forthcoming about an area of concern that's been growing since Musk's takeover of Twitter Inc. The carmaker's directors designed an unprecedented pay package years ago that seeded the CEO with the means to agree to the $44-billion (all figures U.S.) deal just as social media and technology company shares were beginning to plunge.

Twitter's strain on Musk's personal finances — he recently became the first person ever to lose $200 billion of net worth — and his sale of almost $40 billion of Tesla shares amid months of impulsive tweeting has aggrieved several prominent Tesla investors. One accused the board of having been missing in action, while another mixed it up with Musk on the social media service he overpaid for.

Tesla's investor relations representatives and board chair Robyn Denholm didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. The electric-car maker disbanded its communications team in 2019.

Róbertsdóttir called for the carmaker with just three named executive officers and no COO to document processes and procedures for succession of key people and mitigate the financial impact their loss would have.

'Tesla is frequently cited as a prominent example of a company that has so-called key-person risk, due to the prominence of its CEO and the lack of a clear public succession plan or strategy to ameliorate the impacts of his loss,' she wrote. 'At present, Tesla shareholders can have little confidence that said risk has been at all ameliorated.'

Tesla directors including Denholm and James Murdoch were pressed on their approach to governance in November during a trial over whether the board exercised independence from Musk when drawing up his 2018 compensation package potentially worth $55 billion. The son of media baron Rupert Murdoch said Musk had identified a potential CEO successor in recent months, though he wouldn't say who it was.

It's unclear whether a shareholder resolution on compensation will make it onto the agenda for Tesla's May 16 annual meeting. The company announced the timing of the event on page 57 of a 60-page filing a form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission form in October and set a Dec. 22 deadline for submitting resolutions.

Tulipshare, a U.K.-based activist investing platform for retail traders, planned to file a say-on-pay proposal for Musk's compensation to be linked to environmental, social and governance metrics, but was among several shareholders that missed Tesla's disclosure 10 weeks ago.

'As the new owner of one of the largest social media networks globally, Musk has absolutely no excuse for this move,' said Antoine Argouges, Tulipshare's founder and CEO. 'Instead, Tesla chose to do the bare minimum.'

Several corporate governance experts said Tesla did what the SEC legally requires.

'I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for the activists' complaints,' said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania professor who teaches corporate-law classes. 'If the annual meeting change is in the securities disclosure, Tesla met its obligations.'

Others were more amenable to shareholders' gripes.

'It's the kind of thing that a board that knows it's going to come under shareholder pressure tries to do to avoid uncomfortable questions,' said Brian Quinn, a corporate law professor at Boston College Law School. 'It's a short-term strategy, but it won't hold back unhappy shareholders when the activists inevitably come calling for the Tesla board. I suspect that day isn't far off.'",thestar.com,748,news,CA,en,"Dana Hull,Jef Feeley",https://images.thestar.com/siSLZ7SGEx0maCb5PT8QBqE8tkA=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1673022325023):format(webp)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/business/2023/01/05/life-after-elon-musk-teslas-board-takes-heat-over-succession-planning/tesla_vegas.jpg,False,@TorontoStar,6.4135385,94467973aab1ec730fb8ebc9e9568bdb

20,Trimming Tesla Stock's Fair Value Estimate to $220 on Lower Near-Term Outlook,Seth Goldstein,2023-01-03 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1131233/trimming-tesla-stocks-fair-value-estimate-to-220-on-lower-near-term-outlook,morningstar.com,"The electric vehicle maker's 2022 deliveries missed our forecast, but we see a strong upside with much of the bad news already priced in.","Tesla (TSLA) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 deliveries of 405,278 and 1,313,851, respectively. The 2022 deliveries represent 40% year-over-year growth, which was below our previous forecast. Having updated our model for lower near-term volumes, we reduced our Tesla fair value estimate to $220 per share from $250. Our narrow moat rating is unchanged. Shares were down 14% at the time of writing as deliveries came in below Reuters consensus estimates of around 430,000. We think the market is also reacting to Tesla having produced over 34,000 vehicles more than it delivered in the fourth quarter, leading to concerns that the company is seeing slowing demand for its vehicles. However, fourth-quarter deliveries still grew 31% year over year, which we view as a sign that demand is still present and the company can still grow. Accordingly, we forecast over 1.6 million vehicles delivered in 2023, a 24% growth rate. At current prices, we view shares as materially undervalued, with the stock trading in 5-star territory at a little less than 50% of our fair value estimate. Our long-term assumptions remain intact. We forecast over 5 million vehicles by 2031 as Tesla launches the Cybertruck and a new affordable vehicle platform. We also assume cost reductions lead to margin expansion. Given the wide range of outcomes for Tesla, we modeled a downside scenario with a fair value estimate of $90 per share. This scenario assumes long-term deliveries of just 2 million vehicles per year as increased competition limits future growth and forces Tesla to cut prices. We also assume cost reductions do not materialize, leading to profit margin contraction. We also assume no value for the autonomous driving software business, little growth for the insurance business, and no value for Tesla's ancillary businesses. With shares trading just 15% above our downside scenario valuation, we see strong upside to shares with much of the bad news already priced in.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Seth Goldstein",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/M54P22MU3ZFHHJGHFUNW2A6BGQ.jpg,False,@MorningstarInc,6.34301,bcfab4fb20dda5c653ff57e7536ed8a8

37,Tesla Stock Is a Buy Today,Seth Goldstein,2023-01-11 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1131883/tesla-stock-is-a-buy-today,morningstar.com,Morningstar's updated analysis suggests the EV maker's stock price is too low.,"Tesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle makers in the world. In less than a decade, the company went from a startup to a globally recognized luxury automaker with its Model S and Model X vehicles. It competes in the entry-level luxury midsize car and crossover SUV markets with its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Tesla also plans to sell new vehicles over the next several years, including a light truck, a semi truck, a sports car, and an affordable sedan and SUV. Tesla aims to maintain its market leader status as EVs grow from a niche market to mass consumer adoption. To meet growing demand, Tesla opened two new factories in 2022, which increased its production capacity. Tesla invests around 5% of its sales in research and development, focusing on improving its market-leading technology and reducing its manufacturing costs. Key Morningstar Metrics for Tesla Economic Moat Rating Tesla's narrow economic moat is based on its intangible assets and cost advantage. The company's strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise allows the company to make its vehicles cheaper than its competitors. Tesla's brand cachet is not likely to be impaired anytime soon, because we expect the company to keep innovating to stay ahead of startup and established competitors. Tesla's proprietary technology contributes to its intangible asset-driven competitive advantage. We think Tesla benefits from a cost advantage in EV production thanks to its manufacturing scale. Legacy automakers are gradually transitioning to BEV production from internal combustion engines, but we expect they will be saddled with legacy ICE costs for a long time. Read more about Tesla's moat rating. Fair Value Estimate for Tesla Stock Our fair value estimate is $220 per share. We use a weighted average cost of capital of just under 9%. Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse and nondilutive convertible debt. Our valuation assumes Tesla increases its annual total vehicle delivery volume to roughly 5.1 million by 2031. This includes fleet sales, an expanding opportunity for Tesla. Our forecast is well below management's aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade, but it is nearly 4 times the 1.31 million vehicles delivered in 2022. We think Tesla will be successful in continuing to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per vehicle basis. We forecast gross margins will expand to roughly 36% from the 29% achieved in 2021, generating automotive profit growth in excess of revenue growth. Read more about Tesla's fair value estimate. Risk and Uncertainty We see a wide range of potential outcomes for Tesla. Electric vehicles could remain a niche segment if mass-market consumers don't adopt the new powertrain technology due to higher costs and worse function. EVs could also be disrupted by other powertrain technologies. The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As EV competition grows from traditional automakers and new entrants, consumers may have more choices and view Tesla less favorably. The firm is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns. The company is also investing in R&D in an attempt to maintain its technological advantage with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. Tesla CEO Elon Musk owns a little over 13% of the company's stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt. Read more about Tesla's risk and uncertainty. Tesla Bulls Say Tesla has the potential to disrupt the automotive and power generation industries with its technology for EVs, autonomous vehicles, batteries, and solar generation systems.Tesla could see higher profit margins as it reduces unit production costs over the next several years.Through the combination of its industry-leading technology and unique supercharger network, Tesla offers the best function of any EV on the market. Tesla Bears Say Traditional automakers are investing heavily in EV development, which could result in Tesla losing market share and seeing a deceleration in sales growth due to increased competition.EV adoption is driven largely by government initiatives, such as regulations and subsidies, which will limit long-term market growth for Tesla.Solar panel and battery prices may decline faster than Tesla can reduce costs, resulting in little to no profits for the energy generation and storage business.

39,Tesla to put over $770M towards Austin gigafactory expansion,Antoinette Odom,2023-01-11 00:00:00,date,https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/austin/news/2023/01/11/tesla-plans-to-put-over--770m-towards-austin-gigafactory-expansion-,spectrumlocalnews.com,Five more facilities are to be added to Tesla.,"AUSTIN, Texas — The big electric vehicle company based in Austin, Texas, could get bigger after filing to expand with the state. Tesla has plans to invest $775.7 million toward the exansion of Gigafactory Texas, according to government records.
It's one of Tesla's greatest pushes to enlarge its company since establishing its $5.5 billion Germany factory in 2022.
The Texas Department of Licensing and Registration has online documentation showing January filings for Tesla's construction plans.
Five more facilities are to be added to Tesla, which per CNBC include battery cell testing and manufacturing, cathode and drive unit manufacturing, a die shop and more. The announcement of expansion follows CEO Elon Musk's plan to pull in China chief Tom Zhu to supervise Tesla's U.S. assembly plants and sales operations in North America and Europe.
Tesla's fourth-quarter did not meet its distribution goal, as there weren't enough cars delivered.
As COVID restrictions in China mount, Tesla's key Shanghai hub is facing demand concerns, according to Reuters. They also report that the company is operating on a limited production scale in Shanghai through January. So, Tesla is stretching out its reduced output that started in December.
On March 1, Tesla will host its investor day at the Austin facility. According to Reuters, the expansion plans and capital allocation will likely be divulged during that time.",mynews13.com,4349,news,US,en,"Antoinette Odom,Published Am Ct Jan.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Tesla_Logo_AP,False,,7.084259,74dfeb490f02db0bc6ac73d4c59b4f58
40,Tesla cuts vehicle prices in bid to boost flagging demand,Associated Press,2023-01-13 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-online/2023/01/13/tesla-cuts-vehicle-prices-in-bid-to-boost-flagging-demand,ny1.com,"With its sales slowing and its stock price tumbling, Tesla Inc. slashed prices dramatically on several versions of its electric vehicles, making some of its models eligible for a new federal tax…","DETROIT (AP) — With its sales slowing and its stock price tumbling, Tesla Inc. slashed prices dramatically Friday on several versions of its electric vehicles, making some of its models eligible for a new federal tax credit that could help spur buyer interest. The company dropped prices nearly 20% in the United States on some versions of the Model Y SUV, its top seller. That cut will make more versions of the Model Y eligible for a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit that will be available through March. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive model, by about 6%. Far from pleasing investors, the sharp price cuts sent Tesla shares down nearly 4% in midday trading Friday. Since the start of the year, the stock has plummeted more than 65%. Many investors fear that Tesla's sales slowdown will persist and have grown concerned about the erratic behavior of CEO Elon Musk and the distractions caused by his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. 'I think the real driver for all of this is falling demand for Teslas,' said Guidehouse Research e-Mobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid. Itay Michaeli, an industry analyst at Citi, wrote in a note to investors that Tesla appears to be prioritizing sales volume over price — a strategy that could affect its profit margins, at least in the near term. Messages were left Friday seeking a comment from Tesla. The Model Y Performance version, formerly priced at nearly $70,000, now starts at just under $57,000. The starting price of the Model 3, Tesla's lowest-priced vehicle, was cut to just under $44,000 from $47,000. The company's decision to drop the base price of the Model 3, which had already been eligible for the federal tax credit, is a clear sign that demand had weakened, Abuelsamid noted. Tesla has added two huge factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin that are running at only a fraction of their output capacities, 'which is undoubtedly costing them dearly,' Abuelsamid said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

42,Feds review Musk tweet about disabling driver monitoring in Teslas,Tom Krisher,2023-01-09 00:00:00,date,https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/01/09/feds-review-musk-tweet-about-disabling-driver-monitoring-teslas/,hawaiinewsnow.com,The NHTSA said the issue is now part of a broader investigation into at least 14 Teslas that have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot driver assist system.,"DETROIT (AP) — A tweet from Elon Musk indicating that Tesla might allow some owners who are testing a 'Full Self-Driving' system to disable an alert that reminds them to keep their hands on the steering wheel has drawn attention from U.S. safety regulators.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it asked Tesla for more information about the tweet. Last week, the agency said the issue is now part of a broader investigation into at least 14 Teslas that have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot driver assist system.Since 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing 'Full Self-Driving' using owners who haven't been trained on the system but are actively monitored by the company. Earlier this year, Tesla said 160,000, roughly 15% of Teslas now on U.S. roads, were participating. A wider distribution of the software was to be rolled out late in 2022.Despite the name, Tesla still says on its website that the cars can't drive themselves. Teslas using 'Full Self-Driving' can navigate roads themselves in many cases, but experts say the system can make mistakes. 'We're not saying it's quite ready to have no one behind the wheel,' CEO Musk said in October.On New Year's Eve, one of Musk's most ardent fans posted on Twitter that drivers with more than 10,000 miles of 'Full Self-Driving' testing should have the option to turn off the 'steering wheel nag,' an alert that tells drivers to keep hands on the wheel.Musk replied: 'Agreed, update coming in Jan.'It's not clear from the tweets exactly what Tesla will do. But disabling a driver monitoring system on any vehicle that automates speed and steering would pose a danger to other drivers on the road, said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports.'Using FSD beta, you're kind of part of an experiment,' Fisher said. 'The problem is the other road users adjacent to you haven't signed up to be part of that experiment.'Tesla didn't respond to a message seeking comment about the tweet or its driver monitoring.Auto safety advocates and government investigators have long criticized Tesla's monitoring system as inadequate. Three years ago the National Transportation Safety Board listed poor monitoring as a contributing factor in a 2018 fatal Tesla crash in California. The board recommended a better system, but said Tesla has not responded.Tesla's system measures torque on the steering wheel to try to ensure that drivers are paying attention. Many Teslas have cameras that monitor a driver's gaze. But Fisher says those cameras aren't infrared like those of some competitors' driver assistance systems, so they can't see at night or if a driver is wearing sunglasses.Philip Koopman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, argued that Tesla is contradicting itself in a way that could confuse drivers. 'They're trying to make customers happy by taking their hands off the wheel, even while the (owners) manual says ‘don't do that.' ""Indeed, Tesla's website says Autopilot and the more sophisticated 'Full Self-Driving' system are intended for use by a 'fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.' It says the systems are not fully autonomous.NHTSA has noted in documents that numerous Tesla crashes have occurred in which drivers had their hands on the wheel but still weren't paying attention. The agency has said that Autopilot is being used in areas where its capabilities are limited and that many drivers aren't taking action to avoid crashes despite warnings from the vehicle.Tesla's partially automated systems have been under investigation by NHTSA since June of 2016 when a driver using Autopilot was killed after his Tesla went under a tractor-trailer crossing its path in Florida. The separate probe into Teslas that were using Autopilot when they crashed into emergency vehicles started in August 2021.Including the Florida crash, NHTSA has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes in which automated systems are suspected of being used. Nineteen people have died in those crashes.Consumer Reports has tested Tesla's monitoring system, which changes often with online software updates. Initially, the system didn't warn a driver without hands on the wheel for three minutes. Recently, though, the warnings have come in as little as 15 seconds. Fisher said he isn't sure, though, how long a driver's hands could be off the wheel before the system would slow down or shut off completely.In shutting off the 'steering wheel nag,' Fisher said, Tesla could be switching to the camera to monitor drivers, but that's unclear.Despite implying through the names that Autopilot and 'Full Self-Driving' can drive themselves, Fisher said, it's clear that Tesla expects owners to still be drivers. But the NTSB says human drivers can end up dropping their guard and relying too much on the systems while looking elsewhere or doing other tasks.Those who use 'Full Self-Driving,' Fisher said, are likely to be more vigilant in taking control because the system makes mistakes.'I wouldn't dream of taking my hands off the wheel using that system, just because it can do things unexpectedly,' he said.Koopman said he doesn't see a great safety risk from disabling the steering wheel nag because the Tesla monitoring system is so flawed that disabling it doesn't necessarily make Teslas any more dangerous.NHTSA, he said, has enough evidence to take action to force Tesla to install a better monitoring system.The agency says it doesn't comment on open investigations.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.At a Tesla Experience Center in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's Sichuan province, owners ransacked facilities and put up a handwritten list of four demands signed with their names and fingerprints, including a request for warranty extensions of two to four years and rebates for using Tesla Superchargers. Another video showed drivers singing the national anthem in a Tesla store, while one from Changsha in Hunan province featured people chanting 'return our money!'China is a key market for Tesla, and the company enjoyed several perks including tax breaks over the years as it expanded in the country, building its first overseas factory in Shanghai. But it has faced the wrath of Chinese consumers before, including at the Shanghai Auto Show in 2021 when an owner climbed on top of one of its cars to protest about an alleged braking issue.After shipping a record of more than 100,000 China-made EVs in November, Tesla's deliveries dropped sharply in December to below 56,000 amid lacklustre demand and as local production was temporarily suspended for equipment upgrades.Tesla's latest price cuts knock about 10 per cent off the base price of Model Ys in China and 14 per cent off Model 3s. The moves, which make the locally-built models significantly cheaper than the base price of similar Teslas in places such as the US, reflect the intense competition in China's EV market, from Chinese companies like BYD to others including Volkswagen.Tesla shares fell more than 8 per cent last week, following a 65 per cent dive in 2022. – Bloomberg",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/gxu7xOAdKgrqQvtEOrY4yafBmL8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/THWVR3V3YNDEKXTF5J4Q3KUSNA.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.6478243,62fe8d6ed9696e5626b832f35e658403

Then the problems start",Neil BriscoeNeil Briscoe,2023-01-11 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/motors/review/2023/01/11/teslas-model-y-is-fast-its-roomy-and-it-goes-an-impressively-long-way-then-the-problems-start/,irishtimes.com,"Buying a Tesla is rather like buying an old Alfa Romeo. You might get a good one that performs faultlessly for years. Equally, you might not","When you're reviewing a Tesla, it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate the man from the machine. After all, when deciding whether a new Volkswagen is any good, one doesn't first have to sift from one's mind Oliver Blume's latest social media posts, or worry about the treatment of VW's workforce.With Tesla, as in so many ways, things are different. Elon Musk dominates the debate, whether we're talking about electric cars or employment practices, and it can be difficult in the extreme to work out whether you're reviewing the car or Musk's personal peccadillos. He's not the first controversial car company boss (check out Henry Ford's history for more on that), but he is currently grabbing all the headlines that he can.Which brings us to the Tesla Model Y, and it's a car that rather perfectly encapsulates the dichotomy of both Musk and the company that he brought to prominence (note: Musk didn't create Tesla, he invested in it. The company was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning) in that it's both laudable and lacking.What's primarily laudable is what Tesla has long been good, arguably the best in the business, at – batteries and charging. The Model Y gets a 75kWh (useable) battery pack from which it squeezes a claimed 533km of one-charge range. Even driving it in the recent savage cold snap, weather that sent many other EVs scurrying for a heated garage to protect their batteries, the Model Y was easily giving a real-world figure of between 450km and 500km and that includes motorway mileage. That's hugely impressive.[ The Irish Times Car of the Year for 2023: And the winner is... ]Equally, there's the charging. It has been said many times before but it bears saying again – Tesla's network of Supercharger charging points is still by far the best in the business. Where else are you going to find eight-bay charging points pumping out as much as 250kW per plug? A 20-minute charge in the Model Y took us from an indicated 120km range to more than 330km. That's how electric motoring should be.While we're talking upsides, the Model Y is also massively practical. The rear seats are roomy and family friendly. The boot is huge – Tesla, like Land Rover, measures the volume packed to the glass, as (annoyingly) there's no luggage cover, so it's hard to compare it properly to rivals, but the claimed volume of 854 litres is big whatever way you slice it. There's useful under-floor storage space for charging cables, and an extra 117 litres of space in the 'frunk' under the bonnet.Unfortunately, from here on in, the Model Y's case starts to fall apart somewhat. First of all, there's the quality issue. Tesla's, shall we say, variable quality levels have been long noted. Buying a Tesla is rather like buying an old Alfa Romeo. You might get a good one that performs faultlessly and provides reliable transport for years to come. Equally, you might not…While nothing actually went wrong with our test car, the lack of underlying quality in the cabin was very obvious. With each bump or lump in the road that we drove over, the cabin rattled and clattered as if we were carrying around a bag full of used spray paint cans. It was not edifying, and it was certainly not appropriate for a car wearing a €66,000 price tag. For reference, an identically priced Ford Mustang Mach-E exhibited not a single cabin rattle nor squeak when we tested it recently.[ Can Peugeot's 408 lure SUV fans with its sporty take on the crossover craze? ]Some of the fault for those cabin rattles must be levelled at the ride quality. Compared to rivals, the Model Y is noticeably firm on its springs, but it would not feel excessively so were the damping better. Again, comparing it to the Ford, the Mach-E is similarly firm but its damping and suspension control is much better, so you feel that the vehicle moves as a piece when reacting to bumps.The rest of the dynamic package is equally poor. Unlike the Model 3 saloon, with which the Model Y shares a chassis, this SUV feels perched up and somewhat shopping-trolley-like in corners. The steering is artificial in feel and overgeared, so that small movements translate into sudden responses.Even in 'Chill' mode, the response to the accelerator is just as jerky. It is not a comfortable car to drive. Nor is it refined – even without the cabin rattles, there's significant tyre roar and wind noise at a motorway cruise. You notice it most when you slow down and realise just how high you had the stereo turned up. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 or VW ID.5 is far quieter inside.There's also the question of the autopilot, which is, in spite of the name, nothing of the sort – it's adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping steering, and you have to very much watch it like a hawk. To be blunt, I never felt safe using the system. The steering control has an inconsistent response, which can see it firmly hold you in lane or suddenly releasing control in response to what felt like very little pressure on the steering wheel. The acceleration and distance kept from vehicles in front didn't feel confidence-inspiring either. Rivals certainly offer better calibrated systems.[ Is Apple's car coming in 2026? ]Speaking of rivals, I feel that the Model Y's overall performance indicates that what we've expected for some time has come to pass – that Tesla's so-called 'legacy carmaker' rivals have caught up and passed it out. Musk's company still has a lead when it comes to battery performance and charging, but as a car the Model Y has now decidedly slipped behind similarly priced rivals such as the Mustang Mach-E, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, and the VW ID.5 and ID.Buzz. It simply doesn't have the quality levels to compete at the price level it's being pitched.If Elon Musk can unhitch himself from his current social media debacle and refocus his unquestionably large brain on Tesla, perhaps that gap could be made up and even overtaken once again. Either way, Tesla needs to grow up as a carmaker. It needs to stop being part of its owner's personality cult and instead focus on making cars that are of as high quality as its rivals.Tesla has, beyond a doubt, utterly changed the global car market and has spurred the rest of the world's carmakers into making better electric cars. In doing so, it may have sowed the seeds of its own downfall.Tesla Model Y Long Range: the lowdownPower: Two-motor 378KW electric drive developing 450hp and 493Nm of torque, powering all four wheels via a single-speed automatic transmission.CO2 emissions (annual motor tax) 0g/km (€120).Electric consumption: 16.9kWh/100km (WLTP).Range: 533km (WLTP).0-100km/h: 5.0sec.Price: €66,990 as tested, Model Y starts from €52,990.Verdict: Not as good as the Model 3 and slipping behind its rivals.",irishtimes.com,798,news,IE,en,"Neil Briscoe,Neil BriscoeNeil Briscoe",https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/vaygv9EQh54cAw-Sh0Z0gD9r_aM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/B56647PMTFH3XA2J2B54C2TAUE.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.392651,d2c66436cb62676990d68f9791e86471

58,Tesla cuts vehicle prices nearly 20 per cent in bid to boost flagging sales,Tom Krisher,2023-01-13 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com/business/2023/01/13/tesla-cuts-vehicle-prices-nearly-20-per-cent-in-bid-to-boost-flagging-sales.html,thestar.com,"Far from pleasing investors, the sharp price cuts sent Tesla shares down nearly 2% in late-afternoon trading Friday.","DETROIT — With its sales slowing and its stock price tumbling, Tesla Inc. slashed prices dramatically Friday on several versions of its electric vehicles, making some of its models eligible for a new federal tax credit that could help spur buyer interest.

The company dropped prices nearly 20% in the United States on some versions of the Model Y SUV, its top seller. That cut will make more versions of the Model Y eligible for a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit, which will be available through March. Tesla also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive model, by about 6%.

Far from pleasing investors, the sharp price cuts sent Tesla shares down nearly 2% in late-afternoon trading Friday. Since the start of last year, the stock has plummeted more than 65%. Many investors fear that Tesla's sales slowdown will persist and have grown concerned about the erratic behaviour of CEO Elon Musk and the distractions caused by his $44 billion purchase of Twitter.

'I think the real driver for all of this is falling demand for Teslas,' said Guidehouse Research e-Mobility analyst Sam Abuelsamid.

Based on the current short delivery times for Tesla vehicles that once were months long, Tesla's once-sizable order backlog may have been depleted, said Scott Case, CEO of Recurrent, who analyzes the new and used EV markets.

Customers either were awaiting this year's federal tax credits, Case said, or switched to competitors.

'We think it's now more of a competition thing,' he said.

Unlike many of its rivals, though, Tesla can still make money on EVs for one crucial reason, Case said: The company enjoys high profit margins, thanks to manufacturing and battery efficiencies.

Competitors generally lack Tesla's economies of scale and other efficiencies and may struggle to match the price cuts. If so, Tesla could manage to keep vehicle sales at sufficient levels.

'They can afford to make this cut and not be lighting money on fire,' Case said.

Messages were left Friday seeking a comment from Tesla.

Tesla still faces the threat of intensifying competition from other automakers in the United States and globally for years to come. Last year in the United States, total EV sales soared nearly 65% from 2021. Automakers sold 47 electric vehicle models; only four were Teslas. S&P Global Mobility expects the number of EV models to surge to 159 by 2025.

And as overall EV sales are rising, Tesla's U.S. market share is falling. From 2018 through 2020, Tesla represented about 80% of the EV market. By 2021, that figure had sunk to 71%, and it's continued to decline, according to registration data gathered by S&P.

Still, Tesla's U.S. sales rose 40% last year, and S&P expects them to continue to rise as overall electric vehicle sales steadily increase.

Even with U.S. tax credits, EVs remain pricey compared with gas-powered vehicles, largely because of the high cost of batteries. In addition, higher loan rates and more expensive raw materials are keeping costs high for buyers and could limit EV sales, for Tesla as well as its competitors.

Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said those factors are reducing demand for all vehicles, not just Teslas.

Musk's provocative behaviour on Twitter may also be a factor in lower demand. Since taking over the social media platform in October, Musk has loosened restrictions on hate speech and other questionable conduct.

He has repeatedly engaged with figures on the right and far-right and has frequently attacked what he describes as the 'woke mind virus'— a pejorative umbrella term for liberal views that Musk asserts are threatening civilization.

Musk's views are sharply at odds with those of many environmentally conscious Tesla customers who lean Democratic. Survey data from Morning Consult Brand Intelligence shows that in the past year, the number of Americans who view Tesla favourably has dropped. In January of 2022, nearly 43% had a favourable opinion of Tesla, with nearly 15% negative. By this month, those with favourable opinions had dropped to 37%, while the negative views rose to 24%.

Case said he has heard longtime Tesla buyers say during the past six months that they aren't sure about being seen in a Tesla anymore and that they'd now consider buying an EV from a competitor.

With Tesla's price cuts Friday, its Model Y Performance model, formerly priced at nearly $70,000, now starts at just under $57,000. The starting price of the Model 3, Tesla's lowest-priced vehicle, was cut to just under $44,000 from $47,000.

The company's decision to drop the base price of the Model 3, which had already been eligible for the federal tax credit, was a clear sign that demand had weakened, Abuelsamid noted.

Tesla has added two huge factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin that are running at only a fraction of their output capacities, 'which is undoubtedly costing them dearly,' Abuelsamid said.

72,Disney and Tesla's board seat battles are just the beginning. An SEC rule change could put more directors at risk,Lila Maclellan,2023-01-13 00:00:00,date,https://fortune.com/2023/01/13/disney-tesla-board-sec-rule-change-universal-proxy/,fortune.com,One Tesla investor is already planning to make use of the universal proxy requirement to campaign for a board seat.,"A new Securities and Exchange Commission rule that sounds innocuous enough might drive profound changes in how companies and boards conduct their business. We may soon see the rule's effect in high-profile board seat battles, like that brewing at Disney, where activist investor Nelson Peltz is making a play to join the board, and at Tesla, where the fed-up investor Ross Gerber vowed to do the same. It might also fan the flames of both the ESG and anti-ESG movements. Last fall, the SEC began requiring companies to use a universal proxy card for all contested board elections. 'Before, there were two proxy cards, the company card and the investor card, and you had to vote for the whole slate,' Rusty O'Kelley, a senior advisor and governance expert at Russell Reynolds, explains. 'If there were three people on the company card, you had to vote for all three. There was no ability to split your votes and say, ‘I like these people from the company, but that one from the activist.'' Now, all nominees appear on one slate, giving voters the option to pick and choose. On its own, the change might not sound like a big deal. But, in practice, it will make running—and winning—proxy campaigns for board seats significantly cheaper and easier, likely encouraging more activists to launch bids. O'Kelley and Rich Fields, another governance expert at Russell Reynolds, point out in a recent white paper that this requirement arrives when traditional shareholder activism is hopping and institutional investors are wielding their influence. In a proxy contest, the consultants say boards should expect to feel intense new pressures from all sides—from both the Peltz's of the world and cause-based activists, like environmentalists or unionists, and institutional investors and proxy advisors. All will be examining board composition and scanning for weaknesses in individual directors. They'll ask: Does the board have the right mix of skills for the company's current needs? Is it diverse enough? Are some directors serving on too many boards at once? Have members with long tenures overstayed their welcome? 'The universal proxy creates a new sense of urgency. Boards need to encourage lower performing directors to leave the board before activists do it for them,' a leader at a large institutional investor told O'Kelley and Fields. Boards need to take stock, even if they aren't expecting a proxy fight, O'Kelley says. 'Companies need to ensure that their disclosure really reflects why that director is on that board and the unique skills and experiences they're going to bring relevant to the current strategy.' Companies should expect to feel the new rule's effect in the upcoming proxy season. In time, the culture of contested board elections could change now that individual directors will be measured against each other. As a trio of attorneys for Sidley Austin write in a National Association of Corporate Directors blog post, 'There will be a personalization of proxy contests like never seen before.' In other words, expect drama. Lila MacLellanlila.maclellan@fortune.com@lilamaclellanNoted'Peltz came out and the things he's hammering on are really reasonable: succession planning, maybe a bad merger or acquisition, focusing on streaming and the profitability of streaming. Everybody's like, ‘Yeah, those are reasonable things to say.' It's not like he came out and said, ‘Let's break Disney into three different companies.'…I've owned Disney shares since ‘96, and this guy's reasonable.'

Boards that don't already have automation on their agendas should assume that will change. And soon. For an update on how far robots have come, check out this fun read from Bloomberg about the quest to build an automated pizza-making machine, a goal set by a surprising number of Silicon Valley startups. Mushrooms, we learn, will not be governed by code, and explosions are a regular hazard. 
Here's a snippet:
'Consistency has been one of the greatest challenges for Stellar. Arik Jenkins, a former automation engineer at SpaceX, joined Stellar in 2020 and quickly became exposed to the darkest fear from his rocket-making days: Things kept blowing up. Under the pressure of the cooking process, the dough overinflated and then burst. This happened again and again. Hardened fragments, shrinking and then blackening, dotted the walls and ceiling of the 900F oven.
The explosions stemmed from air pockets that formed unpredictably and grew so large that the sauce and cheese slid off them. Desirable in some styles of pizza, puffy crusts didn't work for Stellar. The resulting bare sections looked ugly, and the displaced ingredients piled up in other parts of the pie. Engineers had to lurk outside the oven's windows, armed with a dinner knife tied to a stick, ready to throw open the door and pierce any emerging bubbles.'

The North America Light Electric Vehicles Market should witness market growth of 8.3% CAGR during the forecast period (2022-2028).

EVs have experienced a comeback in the 21st century due to technology advancements, a greater emphasis on renewable energy, and the possible reduction of transportation's influence on climate change, pollution, and other environmental issues. Project Drawdown identifies electric vehicles as one of the 100 most effective modern approaches to combating climate change.

The majority of electric vehicles are powered by lithium-ion batteries (Li-Ions or LIBs). Lithium-ion batteries have a better energy density, a longer lifespan, and a higher power density than the majority of other commercially available batteries. Safety, longevity, thermal breakdown, environmental impact, and cost are complicating factors.

Li-ion batteries must be utilized within the safe temperature and voltage ranges for optimal performance. Increasing the battery's lifespan reduces operational expenses. Operating a subset of the battery cells at a time and swapping these subsets is one method. In the past, some electric cars, such as those manufactured by General Motors, utilized nickel-metal hydride batteries. These battery types are deemed obsolete because they tend to self-discharge in high temperatures.

The government is taking numerous measures to combat climate change, expand access to renewable energy options, and reduce the United States' dependency on oil. The Administration unveiled a range of extraordinary efforts from the federal government, the business sector, and the states. These initiatives include a new framework for automakers, electric car charging firms, electric utilities, and states to collaborate to expedite the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The US market dominated the North America Light Electric Vehicles Market by Country in 2021, and would continue to be a dominant market till 2028; thereby, achieving a market value of $22,624.8 million by 2028. The Canada market is poised to grow at a CAGR of 10.8% during (2022-2028). Additionally, the Mexico market should witness a CAGR of 9.8% during (2022-2028).

Today, consumers expect their cars to offer features that enhance safety, comfort, and convenience.

Over the years, every electronically controlled feature added to vehicles demanded its own electronic control unit (ECU) and supporting communication interfaces, adding more components and burdening vehicle electrical/electronic (EE) architecture with complexity, weight, and cost. A typical premium sedan would house about 100 ECUs and a kilometre-long wiring harness but would not be future proof.

Megatrends such as CASE convergence are expected to augment this burden as a growing number of features are added under each domain. These advanced features will require higher processing speed, no latency, and a V2X enabler. To manage these concerns and meet the requirements, automakers and the vehicle development ecosystem are reconsidering the legacy approach and architectural design.

With the advent of battery-electric and software-defined vehicles (SDVs), OEMs plan to redesign platform layers ground up, starting with vehicle EE architecture, built on high-performance computers and Ethernet backbone.

Investors then sued him, saying that Tesla shares would not have swung so widely in value if he had not dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share.Musk's tweet also attracted the attention of securities regulators, who concluded that it was improper and that he was lying. In a settlement, they forced him to pay $40 million and required him to step down as Tesla chairman.He has since contended that he entered the settlement under duress and maintains that he believed he had locked up financial backing for the buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.Even while he has been making major changes at Twitter, Musk continues to serve as CEO at Tesla and derives most of his wealth and fame from the company.The trial hinges on an Aug. 7, 2018, tweet in which Musk claimed he had lined up financing to pay for a $72 billion buyout of Tesla, which he then amplified with a follow-up statement that made a deal seem imminent.But the buyout never materialized, and now Musk will have to explain his actions under oath in a federal court in San Francisco.

Seven jurors were questioned individually, away from the rest of the jury pool, to reduce the chances of influencing the opinions of others in the courtroom.Chen and lawyers for both the shareholders and Musk ended up grilling seven of those jurors, who variously described Musk as 'arrogant,' 'narcissistic,' 'unpredictable,' 'a little off his rocker,' 'a mercenary' and 'a genius.'Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried that he has been devoting less time to automaker at a time of intensifying competition.Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, 2018, the period covered in the lawsuit.Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now.

77,Elon Musk takes witness stand to defend Tesla buyout tweets,Michael Liedtke,2023-01-20 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com/business/2023/01/20/elon-musk-takes-witness-stand-to-defend-tesla-buyout-tweets.html,thestar.com,Musk defended a 2018 tweet that resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators and led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors.,"SAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk took the witness stand Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private in a deal that never came close to happening.

The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court Friday.

The mercurial billionaire took the witness stand wearing a dark suit on the third day of a civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool.

The nine-person jury assembled earlier this week will be responsible for deciding whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018 damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen.

A month later, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.

In the first of those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for a what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.

On the stand Friday, Musk — who last year bought Twitter for $44 billion — said tweeting is 'most democratic way' to communicate with investors.

'I care a great deal about retail investors,' he said during questioning by shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt.

But he acknowledged that investors can get more detail in a traditional corporate filing with securities regulators, given the character limits set on Twitter.

'I think you can absolutely be truthful' on Twitter, Musk said. 'But can you be comprehensive? Of course not.'

Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be falsehoods, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.

Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when he has been focusing on Twitter, which he acquired in October after trying to back out of that purchase.

Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.

Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133 Friday, down from the company's November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.

After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market's backlash to his handling of Twitter.

Long before Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October, he had set his sights on Tesla, the electric automaker where he continues to serve as CEO and from which he derives most of his wealth and fame.

Musk claimed in a August 7, 2018 tweet that he had lined up the financing to pay for a $72 billion buyout of Tesla, which he then amplified with a follow-up statement that made a deal seem imminent.

But the buyout never materialized and now Musk will have to explain his actions under oath in a federal court in San Francisco. The trial, which begins on Tuesday with jury selection, was triggered by a class-action lawsuit on behalf of investors who owned Tesla stock for a 10-day period in August 2018.

Musk's tweets back then fueled a rally in Tesla's stock price that abruptly ended a week later, after it became apparent that he didn't have the funding for a buyout after all. That resulted in him scrapping his plan to take the automaker private, culminating in a $40 million settlement with U.S. securities regulators that also required him to step down as the company's chairman.

Musk has since contended he entered that settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

The trial's outcome may hinge on the jury's interpretation of Musk's motive for tweets that U.S. District Judge Edward Chen has already decided were a falsehood.

Chen dealt Musk another setback on Friday, when he rejected Musk's bid to transfer the trial to a federal court in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters in 2021. Musk had argued that negative coverage of his Twitter purchase had poisoned the jury pool in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.

The lawsuit is based on the premise that Tesla's shares wouldn't have traded at such a wide range if Musk hadn't dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share. Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The shares closed last week at $122.40, down from its November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.

After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame a production problem, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter.

The trial is likely to provide insights into Musk's management style, given the witness list includes some of Tesla's current and former top executives and board members, including luminaries such as Larry Ellison, Oracle co-founder, as well as James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The drama also may shed light on Musk's relationship with his brother, Kimbal, who is also on the list of potential witnesses who may be called during a trial scheduled to continue through Feb. 1.

79,Elon Musk oversaw video that exaggerated Tesla self-driving capabilities,Bloomberg,2023-01-19 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/19/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-exaggerated-video/,autoblog.com,"Elon Musk oversaw a 2016 video that exaggerated the abilities of Tesla Autopilot, even dictating the claim that the car drove itself, internal emails show","Elon Musk oversaw the creation of a 2016 video (shown above) that exaggerated the abilities of Tesla Inc.'s driver-assistance system Autopilot, even dictating the opening text that claimed the company's car drove itself, according to internal emails viewed by Bloomberg. Musk wrote to Tesla's Autopilot team after 2 a.m. California time in October 2016 to emphasize the importance of a demonstration drive to promote the system, which the chief executive officer made a splashy announcement about a week later. In an Oct. 19 call with reporters and blog post, Tesla said that all its cars from that day forward would ship with the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability. 'Just want to be absolutely clear that everyone's top priority is achieving an amazing Autopilot demo drive,' Musk said in the email. 'Since this is a demo, it is fine to hardcode some of it, since we will backfill with production code later in an OTA update,' he wrote, referring to using temporary code and updating it later using an over-the-air software update. 'I will be telling the world that this is what the car *will* be able to do,' Musk continued, 'not that it can do this upon receipt.' The email sheds light on Musk's mindset before he and Tesla then made claims about capabilities that have yet to materialize more than six years later. After cycling through several different iterations of hardware, the company to this day tells customers using Autopilot and the system it markets as Full Self-Driving to keep their hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over at any moment. In October, Bloomberg News reported that prosecutors in the US Justice Department's Washington and San Francisco offices and investigators at the Securities and Exchange Commission were probing whether the company made misleading statements about its vehicles' automated-driving capabilities. Musk and Tesla — which disbanded its media relations department roughly three years ago — didn't respond to requests for comment. ‘Absolute priority' Under the subject line 'The Absolute Priority,' Musk wrote in his Oct. 11, 2016, email that he had canceled his obligations for the upcoming weekend to work with the Autopilot team on both Saturday and Sunday. He said everyone would be required to write a daily log of what they did to contribute to the success of the demo, and that he would read them personally. Nine days later, after Tesla staffers shared a fourth version of the video, Musk replied that there were still too many jump cuts, and that the demo footage 'needs to feel like one continuous take.' While Musk had written in the earlier email that he would be clear Tesla was demonstrating what its cars would be able to do in the future, he then instructed staffers to open the video with a black screen and three sentences referring to the present. The almost four-minute-long video that Musk shared in a tweet later that day opens with the text he asked for: 'The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.' Seconds later, an engineer hops into the vehicle — a Model X — and The Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"" begins to play. The engineer keeps his hands off the steering wheel as the car pulls forward from a driveway, turns left and travels to Tesla's former headquarters in Palo Alto, California. The engineer steps out of the vehicle, the driver-side door appears to shut itself, and the vehicle parallel parks in a space with no one at the wheel. The video, which remains on Tesla's website, is of interest to attorneys in several lawsuits related to Autopilot crashes, including one involving the family of Walter Huang, the late Apple Inc. employee who died in a crash while using Autopilot in his Model X in March 2018. Lawyers for the family members who sued Tesla in May 2019 asked Ashok Elluswamy, the current director of Autopilot software, during a deposition in June last year whether the video accurately reflected the capabilities of Autopilot at the time of its release. 'The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016,' Elluswamy said. 'It was to portray what was possible.' Reuters was first to report on the deposition earlier this week. Elluswamy declined to comment. Fence collision Tesla and Musk didn't disclose when releasing the video that engineers had created a three-dimensional digital map for the route the Model X took, Elluswamy said during his deposition. Musk said years after the demo that the company doesn't rely on high-definition maps for automated driving systems, and argued systems that do are less able to adapt to their surroundings. The mapping detail — along with Elluswamy's acknowledgment that the car was involved in an accident during the demo — broadly confirm a December 2021 New York Times report that said Tesla's video didn't provide a full picture of how the vehicle operated during the filming. When asked if the Tesla drove up over a curb, through bushes and hit a fence, Elluswamy replied: 'I'm not so sure about the curb or the bush. I do know about the fence.' Last year, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began publicly releasing data on crashes involving automated driver-assistance systems, which the agency ordered automakers to self-report. While Tesla reported the vast majority of such collisions, the regulator cautioned that the data was too limited to draw any conclusions about safety. NHTSA has two active investigations into whether Autopilot is defective. The agency upgraded the first — focused on how Tesla Autopilot handles crash scenes with first-responder vehicles — in June of last year. It initiated the other probe — pertaining to sudden braking — four months earlier. ‘Not fraud' In August, California's Department of Motor Vehicles accused Tesla of misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems. The following month, a customer in the state accused the company of deceptive marketing and sought class-action status for other car owners to join his suit. 'Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,' Tesla said in a Nov. 28 motion to dismiss the California customer's complaint. Musk has said Tesla's ability to make its cars self-driving will determine whether the company is worth 'a lot of money and being worth basically zero.' During a Twitter Spaces conversation last month, he said the company has a leg up over other automakers in this regard. 'Something that Tesla possesses that other automakers do not is that the car is upgradeable to autonomy,' Musk said. 'That's something that no other car company can do.'",autoblog.com,1835,news,GB,en,Bloomberg,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2023/01/19160702/Screen-Shot-2023-01-19-at-4.03.40-PM.png,False,@therealautoblog,6.8736196,faec738c20bfdda7e55e5b89e39103d2
80,"Markets Brief: Earnings Heavyweights Microsoft, Tesla, and Others on Deck This Week",Jakir Hossain,2023-01-20 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1132913/markets-brief-earnings-heavyweights-microsoft-tesla-and-others-on-deck-this-week,morningstar.com,Netflix shows solid subscriber growth and airline tailwinds grow.,"Earnings season is heading into its third week, with major market leaders coming on deck to start reporting results for the fourth quarter of 2022. First among the big names is Microsoft MSFT, which is set to release fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday, Jan. 24 after the bell. Tesla TSLA is expected to report fourth-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday, Jan 25. So far it's been a relatively uneventful start to the earnings season. Against a more reassuring macroeconomic backdrop, the stock market has been fairly quiet. The Morningstar US Market Index is up 3.8% in 2023. Here's what Morningstar analysts think investors should be keeping a close eye on when it comes to their results. Microsoft Earnings Dan Romanoff, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, has been keeping a close eye on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Broadly, investors should be on watch for any signs of deceleration in growth across the company. Microsoft posted solid results during its last quarter, but they were overlooked due to the company slightly missing its guidance on Azure growth, which grew 42% instead of the guided 43%. That, coupled with a weaker-than-expected revenue guidance of $52.35 billion to $53.85 billion for the December quarter, led to Romanoff cutting his fair value estimate to $324 from $352. Earnings per share is expected to be $2.30, while revenue is anticipated to be on the upper end of guidance, at $53.13 billion, according to FactSet. Tesla Earnings Tesla's stock has been dragged down during the past few weeks as potential declining demand, macroeconomic pressures, and concerns over chief executive Elon Musk's role at Twitter and stock sales have increased investors' uncertainty over the company's near-term performance. Shares are down about 36% in the last three months and 60% from a year ago. The focus of Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings will be on profitability metrics. The company cut prices in China back in late October by roughly 9%, and by $7,500 in the U.S. in December, which raised concerns about demand for electric vehicles. Furthermore, chief executive office Elon Musk noted at the start of 2023 that quarterly deliveries were still falling short of market expectations. Tesla has also been ramping up production at two factories, one in Shanghai, China, and another in Austin, Texas, that Morningstar equity strategist Seth Goldstein says should 'boost profits from operating leverage.' The key question will be how the dynamics between price cuts and increased production have affected Tesla's profitability, and gross profit margins will be crucial to keep an eye on. Gross margins remaining in the mid-20% levels would be considered good news, according to Goldstein, as this would be in line with the second and third quarter. 'It would be great news if we see margin expansion. However, if we see gross profit margins contract to the low-20% range from the initial price cuts in China last year, this would likely mean we see a steeper profit margin decline in 2023 due to price cuts as cost reductions are less impactful,' he says. The company also cut prices by as much as 20% across the globe in early January 2023. Tesla's earnings per share is expected to be $1.15 while revenue is anticipated to be around $24.64 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet. Earnings in the Rearview Looking back, the second week of earnings results brought in some pleasant surprises, some of which the market rewarded. Here's some of the major results that the market reacted to. Netflix Shows Surprising Subscriber Growth Shares of Netflix NFLX rallied 8.5% on Jan. 20 after the firm posted results that surprised the market. While earnings came in at $0.12 per share versus estimates of $0.55, revenue was mostly in line, at $7.85 billion versus estimates of $7.86 billion. However, what was most impressive was net subscriber additions of 7.66 million, above the guidance of 4.5 million. The firm will also start to crack down on password-sharing as an effort to further bolster revenue, which may involve giving subscribers the choice to add users to their profile for an additional fee of about 20% of the original subscription cost, says Neil Macker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. 'While we think this plan will boost revenue, we don't believe it will significantly increase new subscriber growth from users not added on to existing plans and could increase churn,' says Macker. Still, Netflix's fair value estimate was increased to $315, from $290, to account for the strategy. Airlines' Tailwinds Persist Fourth-quarter earnings results from United Airlines UAL topped both revenue and earnings per share estimates, showing robust demand for airline services. Despite a brief rally post-results, investors sold off the company's shares, leading to a 4.6% decline on Jan. 18, the day it reported. Comments from management indicated that demand for air travel remains strong, and the industry remains under capacity as reasons for a favorable operating environment. Pretax margins reached 9% during 2022, which exceeded the expectations of Brian Bernard, director of equity research at Morningstar, industrials. 'Previously, we had projected it would take the airline several years to achieve this level of profitability,' he says. The stronger near-term performance is a result of recent high demand and undercapacity in the industry. Management expects this to continue and provide a 'favorable operating environment,' and even set their pretax margin target to 14% by 2026, which would mark an all-time high. However, given the competitive nature of the airline industry, Bernard sees margins averaging 9% in the long term. Other major airlines, such as American Airlines AAL and Southwest Airlines LUV, may also show similar signs of strength in demand when they report results on Jan. 26. Goldman Sachs Has a Rough End to 2022 Goldman Sachs' GS results included a disappointing 60% decline in net income, owing in part to revenue falling 12% from the third quarter and a 5% increase in operating expenses. Earnings came in much lower than expected, at $3.32 per share versus estimates of $5.56. Shares slid 6.4% post-earnings on Jan. 17. The uptick in expenses was surprising, according to Michael Wong, director of equity research for financial services at Morningstar. Expenses from recent acquisitions were already reflected in the third quarter. And given 'trading expenses were high while trading revenue was low, management should have been preparing the company for a tougher environment,' he says. The year 2023 should prove to remain difficult, Wong says. Monetary policies are tightening in addition to macroeconomic uncertainty leading to companies becoming more cautious—potentially inducing a self-fulfilling prophecy of a recession. 'Until corporations can see the light at the end of the tunnel, investment banking revenue will be subdued, likely until the second half of 2023 if not 2024,' he says. Events scheduled for the coming week include: Tuesday: Johnson & Johnson JNJ, Microsoft, and Verizon VZ report earnings.Wednesday: Tesla, AT&T T, and ServiceNow NOW report earnings.Thursday: Visa V, Mastercard MA, and T. Rowe Price TROW report earnings. For the trading week ended Jan. 20: The Morningstar US Market Index fell 0.6%.The best-performing sector was communication services, up 2.5%.The worst-performing sectors were utilities and industrials, each down 2.9%.Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell to 3.48% from 3.51%.West Texas Intermediate crude-oil prices rose 1.82% to $81.32 per barrel.Of the 847 U.S.-listed companies covered by Morningstar, 352, or 42%, were up, and 495, or 58%, declined. What Stocks Are Up? Shares of National Instruments NATI rallied after news broke that Emerson Electric EMR was attempting to purchase the company with a $7 billion offer, Reuters reports. Furniture retailer Wayfair W saw its stock rise after the company revealed plans to slash 1,750 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. Google's parent company, Alphabet GOOGL, also saw its stock rise after the company announced 12,000 layoffs or about 6% of its staff. Tesla's stock rose ahead of earnings as demand for its cars appears to have rebounded following price cuts announced in early January, Business Insider reports. What Stocks Are Down? Goldman Sachs' stock slid after reporting lackluster results that showed net income declining by 60%. The firm reported earnings per share of $3.32, missing estimates of $5.56.

Elon Musk is being sued by Tesla shareholders (AFP photo)By Agence France-Presse: Jury selection began on Tuesday in a California courtroom over whether Elon Musk committed fraud with a pair of 2018 tweets saying he was poised to take Tesla private.The tweets sent the Tesla share price on a rollercoaster ride and Musk is being sued by shareholders who say the tycoon acted recklessly and cost them billions of dollars.The trial is expected to last three weeks and comes at a sensitive time for Musk, who will likely be called to testify.Tesla's share price has plummeted over the past year with investors upset over Musk's buyout of Twitter, the social media platform where the billionaire appears to be devoting much of his attention.Shareholders filed suit against Musk in 2018 for allegedly costing them billions of dollars with a tweet that said ""funding secured"" for a project to buy out the publicly-traded electric automaker.READ | Heavy metal drummer takes Elon Musk to court over $56 billion Tesla payoutIn a second tweet, Musk added that ""investor support is confirmed,"" and that the deal was only awaiting a vote by shareholders.""The plaintiff alleges that these tweets were materially false and artificially affected the price of Tesla stock and other securities after they were made,"" US District Court Judge Edward Chen said while summarizing the case for potential jurors.Musk's short tweets in 2018 have already been scrutinized by US authorities.The country's stock market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, ordered that Musk step down as chairman of Tesla's board and that the company and Musk each pay a fine of $20 million.Musk denies he was being deceitful and his lawyers are expected to call on witnesses to vouch for his plans at the time, including testimony from Musk's friend and fellow billionaire Larry Ellison.Picking jurors began after Chen last week refused a request by Musk to transfer the proceedings to Texas, the southern state where Musk has moved Tesla's headquarters.ALSO READ | Twitter sued after Elon Musk fails to pay rent for San Francisco office spaceTwitter ban requestLawyers representing Musk argued that he would be denied a fair trial in San Francisco, where Twitter is based.On Tuesday, the court reviewed the responses from dozens of potential jurors to a questionnaire, which included their opinions about Musk.One potential juror acknowledged that he would probably not be impartial. ""There's also the billionaire aspect. I'm not a big fan of those people,"" he said.Alex Spiro, Musk's lawyer, asked those up for jury selection to remain ""open-minded"" even if they will first hear the version of the accusers.He also asked the court to not bring up ""recent events at Twitter.""After taking over the social media site in October, Musk fired more than half of its 7,500 employees and upended its content moderation policies, including unblocking the account of former US president Donald Trump.""For the last several months, the local media have saturated this district with biased and negative stories about Mr. Musk that have fostered... highly prejudicial biases in the jury pool,"" the CEO's lawyers argued in a filing.READ MORE | Elon Musk's Twitter sued again, this time for not paying fees to marketing company

Long before Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October, he had set his sights on Tesla, the electric automaker where he continues to serve as CEO and from which he derives most of his wealth and fame. Musk claimed in an August 7, 2018 tweet that he had lined up the financing to pay for a $72 billion buyout of Tesla, which he then amplified with a follow-up statement that made a deal seem imminent. But the buyout never materialized and now Musk will have to explain his actions under oath in a federal court in San Francisco. The trial, which begins on Tuesday with jury selection, was triggered by a class-action lawsuit on behalf of investors who owned Tesla stock for a 10-day period in August 2018. Musk's tweets back then fueled a rally in Tesla's stock price that abruptly ended a week later, after it became apparent that he didn't have the funding for a buyout after all. That resulted in him scrapping his plan to take the automaker private, culminating in a $40 million settlement with U.S. securities regulators that also required him to step down as the company's chairman. Musk has since contended he entered that settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. by signing up you agree to our terms of service The trial's outcome may hinge on the jury's interpretation of Musk's motive for tweets that U.S. District Judge Edward Chen has already decided were a falsehood. Chen dealt Musk another setback on Friday, when he rejected Musk's bid to transfer the trial to a federal court in Texas, where Tesla moves its headquarters in 2021. Musk had argued that negative coverage of his Twitter purchase had poisoned the jury pool in the San Francisco Bay Area. Musk's leadership of Twitter -- where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers -- has proved unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth -- far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit is based on the premise that Tesla's shares wouldn't have traded at such a wide range if Musk hadn't dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share. Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The shares closed last week at $122.40, down from its November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50. After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame a production problem, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market's backlash to his handling of Twitter.

According to Edmunds data for the week ending on January 15, 2023:Car-buying platform Edmunds.com serves nearly 20 million visitors each month. With Edmunds.com Price Promise(R), shoppers can buy smarter with instant, upfront prices for cars and trucks currently for sale at over 10,000 dealer franchises across the U.S.(PRNewswire)On-site shopper consideration1 of Tesla vehicle pages on Edmunds jumped to 4% of all researched brands compared to 1.9% the week prior, which analysts note is nearly at parity with the brand's spike in on-site shopper consideration that was generated in March 2022 when gas prices skyrocketed.The Tesla Model Y became the second most researched vehicle on Edmunds (behind the Honda CR-V), up from 70th place the week prior.The Tesla Model 3 moved up 36 spots to become the 11th most researched vehicle on Edmunds.""Lower prices and immediate availability undeniably resonate with the American consumer"" - J. Caldwell, Edmunds' analyst""Consumers have grown accustomed to price hikes and the expectation to pay over MSRP for quite some time, so a discount this generous or easy to comprehend was understandably welcomed by car shoppers,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. ""These price cuts, as well as inventory on the ground, will win Tesla market share and help consumers overlook the brand's aging lineup. Lower prices and immediate availability undeniably resonate with the American consumer.""Edmunds analysts conducted a deeper dive into Tesla appraisal, pricing and days-to-turn data in the aftermath of the price cut announcement. Edmunds data reveals:Appraisals jumped as current Tesla owners sought real-time updates on the effect the cuts have on the value of their vehicle. According to Edmunds data from January 13, 2023 (the day Tesla announced its price cuts), Tesla appraisals through Edmunds' free online appraisal tool more than tripled in volume, climbing to 3.1% of all vehicles, compared to 0.8% the day prior.Tesla list prices dropped across the board. In the first 17 days of January, prices of 2020 model year or newer used2 Teslas dropped 24.5% since their peak in June 2022. In June 2022, Teslas listed for an average price of $76,626 compared to $58,657 this month. List prices for all 2020 model year or newer used vehicles industry wide dropped 11.6% during the same time period.Used Teslas were already lingering on dealer lots before the announcement — and are expected to sell even slower as price cuts affect their residual values further. Days to turn3 (DTT) for used Tesla models climbed from a low of 24 days in June 2022 to 39 days in December 2022 (on par with the industry average of 39 days in December). Edmunds analysts note this slowdown is the result of a unique combination of factors driving down residual values and demand, including car flippers jumping into the market as used prices hit their peak, followed by a drop in used values and interest rate hikes, controversy surrounding Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition, and incentives introduced by Tesla in November and December. Edmunds analysts expect DTT for used Teslas will only continue to rise through January.""The Tesla price cuts will affect consumers quite differently depending on which side of the news they sit,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director of insights.""For shoppers currently in — or now considering entering — the Tesla market, now is the time to research vehicle inventory, secure financing, and determine how current and upcoming EV tax credits will impact your purchase. Price cuts of 20% or more, with incentives, nationwide don't come around often, so acting now is in your best interest before any corrections in the opposite direction.""For those on wait lists for other electric vehicles with uncertain timelines for vehicle production and delivery, the Tesla price cuts should make you reconsider how much you really want that other vehicle compared to a well-known product with a steep discount from Tesla you can drive off the lot today.""For current Tesla owners who've seen thousands in residual value chopped off their investment, the best course of action is to keep the keys and wait for the market to shift. Eventually the value of your Tesla will normalize the longer it's in your possession.""Shoppers interested in new Tesla models can check out Edmunds test team reviews of all Tesla models here.Consumers considering an EV purchase can also reference Edmunds' new EV incentives page, which helps shoppers quickly find tax credits, incentives and rebates that may apply to their purchase or lease of a new battery electric vehicle (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV).Edmunds guides car shoppers online from research to purchase.

It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court Friday.The mercurial billionaire took the witness stand wearing a dark suit on the third day of a civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool.The nine-person jury assembled earlier this week will be responsible for deciding whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018 damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen.A month later, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.In the first of those those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grapping with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.On the stand Friday, Musk — who last year bought Twitter for $44 billion — said tweeting is the 'most democratic way' to communicate with investors.'I care a great deal about retail investors,' he said during questioning by shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt.But he acknowledged that investors can get more detail in a traditional corporate filing with securities regulators, given the character limits set on Twitter.'I think you can absolutely be truthful' on Twitter, Musk said. 'But can you be comprehensive? Of course not.'Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be falsehoods, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when he has been focusing on Twitter, which he acquired in October after trying to back out of that purchase.Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133 Friday, down from the company's November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter.

Investors then sued him, saying that Tesla shares would not have swung so widely in value if he had not dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share.Musk's tweet also attracted the attention of securities regulators, who concluded that it was improper and that he was lying. In a settlement, they forced him to pay $40 million and required him to step down as Tesla chairman.He has since contended that he entered the settlement under duress and maintains that he believed he had locked up financial backing for the buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.Even while he has been making major changes at Twitter, Musk continues to serve as CEO at Tesla and derives most of his wealth and fame from the company.The trial hinges on an Aug. 7, 2018, tweet in which Musk claimed he had lined up financing to pay for a $72 billion buyout of Tesla, which he then amplified with a follow-up statement that made a deal seem imminent.But the buyout never materialized, and now Musk will have to explain his actions under oath in a federal court in San Francisco.

Musk had argued that negative coverage of his Twitter purchase had poisoned the jury pool in the San Francisco Bay Area.The challenge of finding jurors without strong feelings about Musk became evident during Tuesday's painstaking selection process.At one point, the judge flagged some prospective jurors who had expressed extreme misgivings or enthusiasm about Musk in pretrial questionnaires. Seven jurors were questioned individually, away from the rest of the jury pool, to reduce the chances of influencing the opinions of others in the courtroom.Chen and lawyers for both the shareholders and Musk ended up grilling seven of those jurors, who variously described Musk as 'arrogant,' 'narcissistic,' 'unpredictable,' 'a little off his rocker,' 'a mercenary' and 'a genius.'Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried that he has been devoting less time to automaker at a time of intensifying competition.Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, 2018, the period covered in the lawsuit.Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now.

89,Elon Musk takes witness stand to defend Tesla buyout tweets,MICHAEL LIEDTKE,2023-01-20 00:00:00,date,https://www.nbc12.com/2023/01/20/elon-musk-takes-witness-stand-defend-tesla-buyout-tweets/,nbc12.com,Elon Musk appeared in court Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private in a deal that never came close to happening.,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk took the witness stand Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private in a deal that never came close to happening.The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court Friday.The mercurial billionaire took the witness stand wearing a dark suit on the third day of a civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool.The nine-person jury assembled earlier this week will be responsible for deciding whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018 damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen.A month later, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.In the first of those those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grapping with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.On the stand Friday, Musk — who last year bought Twitter for $44 billion — said tweeting is the 'most democratic way' to communicate with investors.'I care a great deal about retail investors,' he said during questioning by shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt.But he acknowledged that investors can get more detail in a traditional corporate filing with securities regulators, given the character limits set on Twitter.'I think you can absolutely be truthful' on Twitter, Musk said. 'But can you be comprehensive? Of course not.'Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be falsehoods, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when he has been focusing on Twitter, which he acquired in October after trying to back out of that purchase.Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133 Friday, down from the company's November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter.

According to Edmunds data for the week ending on January 15, 2023:Car-buying platform Edmunds.com serves nearly 20 million visitors each month. With Edmunds.com Price Promise(R), shoppers can buy smarter with instant, upfront prices for cars and trucks currently for sale at over 10,000 dealer franchises across the U.S.(PRNewswire)On-site shopper consideration1 of Tesla vehicle pages on Edmunds jumped to 4% of all researched brands compared to 1.9% the week prior, which analysts note is nearly at parity with the brand's spike in on-site shopper consideration that was generated in March 2022 when gas prices skyrocketed.The Tesla Model Y became the second most researched vehicle on Edmunds (behind the Honda CR-V), up from 70th place the week prior.The Tesla Model 3 moved up 36 spots to become the 11th most researched vehicle on Edmunds.""Lower prices and immediate availability undeniably resonate with the American consumer"" - J. Caldwell, Edmunds' analyst""Consumers have grown accustomed to price hikes and the expectation to pay over MSRP for quite some time, so a discount this generous or easy to comprehend was understandably welcomed by car shoppers,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. ""These price cuts, as well as inventory on the ground, will win Tesla market share and help consumers overlook the brand's aging lineup. Lower prices and immediate availability undeniably resonate with the American consumer.""Edmunds analysts conducted a deeper dive into Tesla appraisal, pricing and days-to-turn data in the aftermath of the price cut announcement. Edmunds data reveals:Appraisals jumped as current Tesla owners sought real-time updates on the effect the cuts have on the value of their vehicle. According to Edmunds data from January 13, 2023 (the day Tesla announced its price cuts), Tesla appraisals through Edmunds' free online appraisal tool more than tripled in volume, climbing to 3.1% of all vehicles, compared to 0.8% the day prior.Tesla list prices dropped across the board. In the first 17 days of January, prices of 2020 model year or newer used2 Teslas dropped 24.5% since their peak in June 2022. In June 2022, Teslas listed for an average price of $76,626 compared to $58,657 this month. List prices for all 2020 model year or newer used vehicles industry wide dropped 11.6% during the same time period.Used Teslas were already lingering on dealer lots before the announcement — and are expected to sell even slower as price cuts affect their residual values further. Days to turn3 (DTT) for used Tesla models climbed from a low of 24 days in June 2022 to 39 days in December 2022 (on par with the industry average of 39 days in December). Edmunds analysts note this slowdown is the result of a unique combination of factors driving down residual values and demand, including car flippers jumping into the market as used prices hit their peak, followed by a drop in used values and interest rate hikes, controversy surrounding Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition, and incentives introduced by Tesla in November and December. Edmunds analysts expect DTT for used Teslas will only continue to rise through January.""The Tesla price cuts will affect consumers quite differently depending on which side of the news they sit,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director of insights.""For shoppers currently in — or now considering entering — the Tesla market, now is the time to research vehicle inventory, secure financing, and determine how current and upcoming EV tax credits will impact your purchase. Price cuts of 20% or more, with incentives, nationwide don't come around often, so acting now is in your best interest before any corrections in the opposite direction.""For those on wait lists for other electric vehicles with uncertain timelines for vehicle production and delivery, the Tesla price cuts should make you reconsider how much you really want that other vehicle compared to a well-known product with a steep discount from Tesla you can drive off the lot today.""For current Tesla owners who've seen thousands in residual value chopped off their investment, the best course of action is to keep the keys and wait for the market to shift. Eventually the value of your Tesla will normalize the longer it's in your possession.""Shoppers interested in new Tesla models can check out Edmunds test team reviews of all Tesla models here.Consumers considering an EV purchase can also reference Edmunds' new EV incentives page, which helps shoppers quickly find tax credits, incentives and rebates that may apply to their purchase or lease of a new battery electric vehicle (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV).Edmunds guides car shoppers online from research to purchase.

Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.The lawsuit is based on the premise that Tesla's shares wouldn't have traded at such a wide range if Musk hadn't dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share. Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The shares closed last week at $122.40, down from its November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame a production problem, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market's backlash to his handling of Twitter.The trial is likely to provide insights into Musk's management style, given the witness list includes some of Tesla's current and former top executives and board members, including luminaries such as Larry Ellison, Oracle co-founder, as well as James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The drama also may shed light on Musk's relationship with his brother, Kimbal, who is also on the list of potential witnesses who may be called during a trial scheduled to continue through Feb. 1.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court Friday.The mercurial billionaire took the witness stand wearing a dark suit on the third day of a civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool.The nine-person jury assembled earlier this week will be responsible for deciding whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018 damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen.A month later, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.In the first of those those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grapping with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.On the stand Friday, Musk — who last year bought Twitter for $44 billion — said tweeting is the 'most democratic way' to communicate with investors.'I care a great deal about retail investors,' he said during questioning by shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt.But he acknowledged that investors can get more detail in a traditional corporate filing with securities regulators, given the character limits set on Twitter.'I think you can absolutely be truthful' on Twitter, Musk said. 'But can you be comprehensive? Of course not.'Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be falsehoods, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when he has been focusing on Twitter, which he acquired in October after trying to back out of that purchase.Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133 Friday, down from the company's November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter.

Of course not.'Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be falsehoods, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when he has been focusing on Twitter, which he acquired in October after trying to back out of that purchase.Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133 Friday, down from the company's November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market's backlash to his handling of Twitter.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

According to Edmunds data for the week ending on January 15, 2023:Car-buying platform Edmunds.com serves nearly 20 million visitors each month. With Edmunds.com Price Promise(R), shoppers can buy smarter with instant, upfront prices for cars and trucks currently for sale at over 10,000 dealer franchises across the U.S.(PRNewswire)On-site shopper consideration1 of Tesla vehicle pages on Edmunds jumped to 4% of all researched brands compared to 1.9% the week prior, which analysts note is nearly at parity with the brand's spike in on-site shopper consideration that was generated in March 2022 when gas prices skyrocketed.The Tesla Model Y became the second most researched vehicle on Edmunds (behind the Honda CR-V), up from 70th place the week prior.The Tesla Model 3 moved up 36 spots to become the 11th most researched vehicle on Edmunds.""Lower prices and immediate availability undeniably resonate with the American consumer"" - J. Caldwell, Edmunds' analyst""Consumers have grown accustomed to price hikes and the expectation to pay over MSRP for quite some time, so a discount this generous or easy to comprehend was understandably welcomed by car shoppers,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. ""These price cuts, as well as inventory on the ground, will win Tesla market share and help consumers overlook the brand's aging lineup. Lower prices and immediate availability undeniably resonate with the American consumer.""Edmunds analysts conducted a deeper dive into Tesla appraisal, pricing and days-to-turn data in the aftermath of the price cut announcement. Edmunds data reveals:Appraisals jumped as current Tesla owners sought real-time updates on the effect the cuts have on the value of their vehicle. According to Edmunds data from January 13, 2023 (the day Tesla announced its price cuts), Tesla appraisals through Edmunds' free online appraisal tool more than tripled in volume, climbing to 3.1% of all vehicles, compared to 0.8% the day prior.Tesla list prices dropped across the board. In the first 17 days of January, prices of 2020 model year or newer used2 Teslas dropped 24.5% since their peak in June 2022. In June 2022, Teslas listed for an average price of $76,626 compared to $58,657 this month. List prices for all 2020 model year or newer used vehicles industry wide dropped 11.6% during the same time period.Used Teslas were already lingering on dealer lots before the announcement — and are expected to sell even slower as price cuts affect their residual values further. Days to turn3 (DTT) for used Tesla models climbed from a low of 24 days in June 2022 to 39 days in December 2022 (on par with the industry average of 39 days in December). Edmunds analysts note this slowdown is the result of a unique combination of factors driving down residual values and demand, including car flippers jumping into the market as used prices hit their peak, followed by a drop in used values and interest rate hikes, controversy surrounding Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition, and incentives introduced by Tesla in November and December. Edmunds analysts expect DTT for used Teslas will only continue to rise through January.""The Tesla price cuts will affect consumers quite differently depending on which side of the news they sit,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director of insights.""For shoppers currently in — or now considering entering — the Tesla market, now is the time to research vehicle inventory, secure financing, and determine how current and upcoming EV tax credits will impact your purchase. Price cuts of 20% or more, with incentives, nationwide don't come around often, so acting now is in your best interest before any corrections in the opposite direction.""For those on wait lists for other electric vehicles with uncertain timelines for vehicle production and delivery, the Tesla price cuts should make you reconsider how much you really want that other vehicle compared to a well-known product with a steep discount from Tesla you can drive off the lot today.""For current Tesla owners who've seen thousands in residual value chopped off their investment, the best course of action is to keep the keys and wait for the market to shift. Eventually the value of your Tesla will normalize the longer it's in your possession.""Shoppers interested in new Tesla models can check out Edmunds test team reviews of all Tesla models here.Consumers considering an EV purchase can also reference Edmunds' new EV incentives page, which helps shoppers quickly find tax credits, incentives and rebates that may apply to their purchase or lease of a new battery electric vehicle (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV).Edmunds guides car shoppers online from research to purchase.

The tweets sent the Tesla share price on a rollercoaster ride and Musk is being sued by shareholders who say the tycoon acted recklessly and cost them billions of dollars. The trial is expected to last three weeks and comes at a sensitive time for Musk, who will likely be called to testify. Tesla's share price has plummeted over the past year with investors upset over Musk's buyout of Twitter, the social media platform where the billionaire appears to be devoting much of his attention. Shareholders filed suit against Musk in 2018 for allegedly costing them billions of dollars with a tweet that said ""funding secured"" for a project to buy out the publicly-traded electric automaker. In a second tweet, Musk added that ""investor support is confirmed,"" and that the deal was only awaiting a vote by shareholders. ""The plaintiff alleges that these tweets were materially false and artificially affected the price of Tesla stock and other securities after they were made,"" US District Court Judge Edward Chen said while summarizing the case for potential jurors. Musk's short tweets in 2018 have already been scrutinized by US authorities. The country's stock market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, ordered that Musk step down as chairman of Tesla's board and that the company and Musk each pay a fine of $20 million. Musk denies he was being deceitful and his lawyers are expected to call on witnesses to vouch for his plans at the time, including testimony from Musk's friend and fellow billionaire Larry Ellison. Picking jurors began after Chen last week refused a request by Musk to transfer the proceedings to Texas, the southern state where Musk has moved Tesla's headquarters. - Twitter ban request - Lawyers representing Musk argued that he would be denied a fair trial in San Francisco, where Twitter is based. On Tuesday, the court reviewed the responses from dozens of potential jurors to a questionnaire, which included their opinions about Musk. One potential juror acknowledged that he would probably not be impartial. ""There's also the billionaire aspect. I'm not a big fan of those people,"" he said. Alex Spiro, Musk's lawyer, asked those up for jury selection to remain ""open-minded"" even if they will first hear the version of the accusers. He also asked the court to not bring up ""recent events at Twitter."" After taking over the social media site in October, Musk fired more than half of its 7,500 employees and upended its content moderation policies, including unblocking the account of former US president Donald Trump. ""For the last several months, the local media have saturated this district with biased and negative stories about Mr. Musk that have fostered... highly prejudicial biases in the jury pool,"" the CEO's lawyers argued in a filing.",dailymail.co.uk,127,news,GB,en,Afp,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/18/01/wire-66687557-1674004542-312_636x382.jpg,False,,6.654865,f132e584e3bc4564488f5c4133955e9e

The trial, which begins on Tuesday with jury selection, was triggered by a class-action lawsuit on behalf of investors who owned Tesla stock for a 10-day period in August 2018.Musk's tweets back then fueled a rally in Tesla's stock price that abruptly ended a week later, after it became apparent that he didn't have the funding for a buyout after all. That resulted in him scrapping his plan to take the automaker private, culminating in a $40 million settlement with U.S. securities regulators that also required him to step down as the company's chairman.Musk has since contended he entered that settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.The trial's outcome may hinge on the jury's interpretation of Musk's motive for tweets that U.S. District Judge Edward Chen has already decided were a falsehood.Chen dealt Musk another setback on Friday, when he rejected Musk's bid to transfer the trial to a federal court in Texas, where Tesla moves its headquarters in 2021. Musk had argued that negative coverage of his Twitter purchase had poisoned the jury pool in the San Francisco Bay Area.Musk's leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.The lawsuit is based on the premise that Tesla's shares wouldn't have traded at such a wide range if Musk hadn't dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share. Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The shares closed last week at $122.40, down from its November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50.After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame a production problem, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world's richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market's backlash to his handling of Twitter.The trial is likely to provide insights into Musk's management style, given the witness list includes some of Tesla's current and former top executives and board members, including luminaries such as Larry Ellison, Oracle co-founder, as well as James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The drama also may shed light on Musk's relationship with his brother, Kimbal, who is also on the list of potential witnesses who may be called during a trial scheduled to continue through Feb. 1.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Lawyers representing the shareholders are going to try to goad him, Mr Crudo said. 'They're going to try and get him to crack wise, make disparaging comments about lawyers, not answer their questions.'If he comes across as not credible, if they don't like him, I think it's going to seep into the big-dollar legal questions that the jury is going to consider,' Mr Crudo added.Mr Musk has publicly expressed hostility to his legal adversaries. The case he's fighting now mirrors a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which resulted in his reluctantly agreeing to have his future social media posts screened by a Tesla lawyer.He has railed against the agency ever since, saying at a Ted Talk last year that the pressure to settle the case was like having a gun held to his 'child's head'.Mr Musk is no stranger to the witness box. In a recent court fight, he showed more restraint. At a November trial in Delaware over his pay package, he sparred with a lawyer for investors. But he was subdued and calm compared with the hostile days he spent on the stand at the same court in 2021 defending his acquisition of SolarCity.Mr Musk may not testify in San Francisco until Monday. When he does, the plaintiffs' lawyer has to be careful not to cross a line in trying to provoke the chief executive, Crudo said. Mr Musk can afford to be a little combative if it comes across to jurors as a fair response to the questions, he said.'If they get the sense the lawyer's goading him and baiting, and they don't like the lawyer, then they're going to give Musk permission to tee off on the lawyer because they're going to think the lawyer deserved it,' Mr Crudo said. Lawyers for the shareholders 'want to let his inner Elon Musk come out.

104,Elon Musk's Tesla ‘funding secured' trial to begin after jury selected,Dave Lee,2023-01-18 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/01/18/elon-musks-tesla-funding-secured-trial-to-begin-after-jury-selected/,irishtimes.com,Trial is scheduled to last about 10 days,"A group of nine jurors were due to hear opening arguments on Wednesday in a trial over Elon Musk's tweets claiming he had 'funding secured' to take Tesla private in 2018.The class action lawsuit was brought by investors who allege Musk artificially boosted Tesla's stock price when he wrote on Twitter in August 2018 that he was considering taking the electric-car maker private at a price of $420 (€389) a share and had financing in place to do so. A deal never materialised. Shareholders allege the posts ultimately caused them significant financial losses as Tesla shares whipsawed in response.Musk argues his posts, which prompted Tesla's stock price to jump sharply and end the day 11 per cent up, were based on conversations with backers from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and what he considered a 'handshake' agreement to take the company off the public markets.Opening statements had been expected to begin on Tuesday, but US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco acknowledged jury selection had taken longer than anticipated as both sides in the case debated prospective jurors' neutrality.Earlier in the case, Musk's attorneys had unsuccessfully sought to move the trial from California to Texas, where Tesla is now based, amid concerns that the jury pool in San Francisco would be tainted due to discontent around Musk's recent management of Twitter, which included cutting its 7,500-strong workforce nearly in half.During the selection process, one prospective juror had described Musk as 'arrogant', 'unpredictable' and 'irrational at times'. Another said: 'I think he's a little off his rocker.' Ultimately, a nine-member jury was selected, comprising seven men and two women.The trial is scheduled to last about 10 days.In an earlier ruling, Chen said jurors should consider Musk's tweets reckless and false. Jurors will decide if he knowingly and materially misled investors and, if so, whether the plaintiffs are owed any damages.The extensive potential witness list includes Musk; members of Tesla's board, its chief financial officer and head of investor relations; and Silicon Valley figures such as Silver Lake managing partner Egon Durban, and Oracle co-founder and Musk confidant Larry Ellison.Musk's legal team is also seeking testimony from the head of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan, and several other PIF figures, to testify at the trial. PIF has filed a motion to block the request, arguing that the San Francisco court does not have the jurisdiction to compel the Saudi executives to appear.Earlier court filings showed how the relationship between Musk and al-Rumayyan quickly deteriorated over text messages when media reports on the go-private discussions began circulating.The 'funding secured' tweet has proven costly for Musk. He and Tesla each paid $20 million to settle legal action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk also had to resign as the carmaker's chair, although he kept his position as chief executive.The legal showdown comes amid a period of severe market turbulence for Tesla. The company's share price has fallen 61.7 per cent over the past 12 months, as demand for its cars has softened. Some investors also believe that Musk's recent purchase of Twitter has left the 51-year-old chief executive heavily distracted. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,Dave Lee,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/6lomYPkH9fEgPU_VIFCr5TUAh3w=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/7DNOAU62MOOX3XB2OKOZ7IUB4E.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.6275444,dc979ea3bf43b039d6a0ecd73caa65c3

""Based on the adverse impact of price cuts offset by an average incremental margin on the increase in sales that we estimate at 30%, our earnings estimates move moderately lower in 2023 and our price objective is now $130 (was $135)."" Tesla looks poised to make 10% to 20% less per car sale, and the bank forecasted that additional incremental cuts could follow over the next two years. Analysts trimmed earnings-per-share estimates for 2023 and 2024. BofA noted that Tesla remains fairly valued and maintained its neutral rating on the stock, which climbed 5.9% to $129.65 on Tuesday. Strategists pointed out that the company's self-funding status is unique among EV competitors, but less notable among legacy automakers. Tesla faces near-term obstacles including a downbeat macro environment of higher interest rates and a looming recession, as well as potential risks to the broader EV market. Altogether, along with Musk's distractions associated with his acquisition of Twitter, BofA said a neutral stock rating is ""appropriate."" Also on Tuesday, Jefferies slashed its price target on Tesla by 49% to $180 from $350 but maintained its buy rating on the stock, as the long-time bull said the company's recent price cuts will support a wider goal of making electric vehicles more affordable.  Read the original article on Business Insider",autoblog.com,1835,news,GB,en,Insider,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insider_articles_922/803fa3a97b5483d399c6117e36a6380d,False,@therealautoblog,6.613688,9105094b27bd283413ce8ab0bf5043c5

Moments where the car stops at a red light and accelerates at a green light reflect capabilities the vehicle didn't have. Reuters' report is based on a transcript from Ashok Elluswamy, the director of Autopilot software at Tesla, who was questioned in a deposition in July 2022 that's being used as evidence in a lawsuit against Tesla for a lethal car crash involving a former Apple engineer in 2018, according to Reuters.   While Tesla's technology can help with things like braking, steering, and lane changes, according to the company's website, ""the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.""  Musk, however, posted that video on Twitter in 2016 as evidence that Tesla could drive itself.  The video used ""3D mapping"" — a way of creating three dimensional views of objects — on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, Reuters reported citing Elluswamy's comments.  ""The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,"" Elluswamy said in a transcript that was seen by Reuters.

Two of the most prominent new EV makers — Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. — have lost roughly 90% of their equity values from their bull-market peaks, compared with a 69% drop for Tesla. The companies have struggled to ramp up output of vehicles amid supply-chain woes just as investors grew leery of highly valued companies with no earnings. 'Tesla's stock performance has certainly had an impact on the group, and this group's own production issues have also weighed,' said Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas. A Rivian representative declined to comment on the stock-price decline, while Lucid didn't reply to a request for comment. Both stocks were trading lower in New York on Thursday, Rivian slid as much as 3% and Lucid fell 3.4%.  The staggering 740% climb for Tesla shares in 2020 helped spur investor euphoria around the sector. EV stocks of all kinds — whether the companies were making passenger cars, commercial vehicles, buses or niche autos — exploded as well, with even the tiniest names commanding valuations of several billion dollars. Rivian and Lucid were touted as potential 'next Teslas,' with valuations bigger than century-old legacy car companies.  Lucid began trading in July 2021 and its equity value topped out at $91 billion in November that year. Rivian shares peaked just days after its November 2021 initial public offering, valuing the company at $153 billion — more than Volkswagen AG, despite Rivian having zero revenue at the time.  Rising interest rates over the past year and fears of a recession have curbed investors' risk appetite, causing them to flee unprofitable companies with high expected growth. Rivian is now worth $14.8 billion, while Lucid is valued at $13.7 billion. Even Tesla, which is profitable, plunged, casting a shadow over the rest of the industry. Lucid built 7,180 Air Sedans in 2022, a far cry from its projection of 20,000 vehicles at the beginning of that year, as it struggled with supply-chain snags and logistics problems. Rivian also narrowly missed its annual production target of making 25,000 cars.  Their sinking share prices will raise the cost of equity financing for the carmakers, which are still investing heavily in their businesses.  Lucid, which had $3.3 billion of cash, said in November it could raise up to $1.5 billion in equity in subsequent months. For now, Rivian has no immediate need to tap capital markets —- the company had about $13.2 billion in cash as of Sept. 30, which it said is enough until 2025, though it's been spending a lot to bring models to market and expand production.   'People are worried that given the pace of production, they will not be able to make cars fast enough to reach that point where they will not need to raise cash anymore,' Canaccord's Gianarikas said of Rivian.   The EV startups appear increasingly risky at a time when investors are looking for safe assets. Car manufacturing was already a capital-intensive, supply-chain-focused business. On top of that, the industry is highly sensitive to economic swings and climbing borrowing costs that drive up the cost of financing a car purchase. And as consumers tighten their purse strings, EVs that are typically more expensive than gasoline-powered vehicles are bound to take a harder hit.    'Most unprofitable technology stocks got hard hit last year due to tightening Fed policies and commensurate impact on interest rates,' said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at SPEAR Invest. 'But in addition to that, fundamentals for EVs deteriorated in the fourth quarter as it became clear that too much supply was coming on the market.' For Rivian, the selloff has been especially ugly. It has performed worse than Tesla and Lucid, as well as other EV makers such as Nikola Corp., Fisker Inc., Polestar Automotive Holding UK Plc, Workhorse Group Inc. and Lordstown Motors Corp.  The disadvantages of being a smaller EV maker in these times became clearer last week when Tesla announced a price cut across its product lineup, a move that analysts said could come as a bigger blow to its competitors who will be forced to follow. On Friday's trading session after the cut was announced, Rivian and Lucid shares dropped more than Tesla's.  Shrunken equity values and price cuts aren't the only risks the startups face. The pace of EV sales also is expected be slower than previously expected. According to BloombergNEF, while the adoption of electric cars will continue to rise in 2023, it will be at a more tepid pace than the last two years.  'Even without a recession, the risk for the ‘next Teslas' is elevated,' SPEAR's Delevska said. 'Tesla now has scale and profitability, and while we expect significant downside to that profitability, we don't think Tesla will go out of business. Many of the newcomers will.'

One investor plans to make a board seat bid, while an Iceland-based shareholder is proposing that the board create and maintain a key-person risk report about CEO Elon Musk. That shareholder wants the board to reassess the company's dependence on Musk's leadership since he appears to be distracted—to put it mildly—by his day job as Twitter CEO. (Musk is also the chief executive at SpaceX.) As the name implies, a company is said to have key-person risk, née key-man risk, when it relies too heavily on one individual to maintain operations and momentum. Boards are expected to develop risk-mitigation plans for anything that might sideline an influential figure, including illnesses, accidents, unexpected deaths, criminal charges, or sudden resignations. Key-person risk comes in 'three flavors,' The Economist wrote in 2018. Sometimes one person has too much control (think CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Meta or any company where voting rights give a founder-CEO outsized influence). Other times, only one executive is seen as talented enough for the job (consider Steve Jobs at Apple, before Tim Cook proved his mettle, or JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon now). Then some companies are so complex only one mind understands how all its pieces fit together. But it isn't only CEOs who get caught up in unhealthy codependent relationships. The titular key person might be an inventor, marketing director, or CTO. It's different for every business, says Fred Foulkes, a professor of management at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, recounting a time he sat on the board of a restaurant company that relied on its sharp real estate expert.  While companies of all sizes should guard against key-person risk, it might pose the biggest challenge for midsize firms, says Paroon Chadha, CEO and cofounder of OnBoard. He argues that large firms are typically aware of this hazard and will prioritize succession planning. They have systems and thousands of eyes—shareholders, institutional investors, the press—tracking the problem. Smaller companies, too, are conscious of key-person risk because of their size. 'Scarcity drives clarity,' says Chadha. However, midsize companies, having neither depth nor a fierce survival instinct, might hire functional leaders without thinking much about succession. Fortunately, boards can pull a few levers to protect companies from key-person risk. The most obvious first step is to take out key-person insurance. Many companies also impose rules about how many leaders can share the same flight. While rare, term limits for a CEO can force a company to see a chief executive as a caretaker rather than a lifer. In any case, most companies are more protective of a top executive's energy than Tesla, says Foulkes. He remembers one situation where a CEO sought to become the chair of a company his son launched. The board agreed to it only after the CEO pledged not to spend much time at the startup. 'At least in my experience on boards,' Foulkes deadpans, 'you want your CEO to be full-time at the company.' Because key-person risk isn't totally within any mortal's control, boards should also commit to rigorous succession planning that goes deep into an organization, says Donna Hamlin, CEO of BoardWise. Board members have been hands-off about looking beyond the CEO role for a long time, but that's changing. Some boards have begun matching directors with specific skills to their counterpart executives, so board members can help develop and mentor talent while gaining deeper insight into the company's executive ranks. OnBoard's Chadha sees the value in that trend but also praises the unorthodox style at Netflix. There, board members attend a few annual executive meetings, learning about a company's leaders firsthand and in real-time rather than passively consuming a prepared narrative fed to directors at board meetings. Once a company has identified internal candidates for promotion into key roles, they must also be careful in communicating their plans, Chadha cautions, so high-potential employees do not leave in frustration. A clumsy attempt to address key-person risk could create new vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, a potential change to employment laws could make external searches easier. The Biden administration hopes to ban noncompete agreements, which prohibit former employees from accepting jobs within the same industry for a set period. If outlawed, boards thinking ahead could search the competition for key-person successors, knowing those stars could start immediately.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please click here to view or download a prospectus online or call 833.AXS.ALTS (833.297.2587). Read the fund's prospectus carefully before you invest.AXS leveraged and inverse ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged and inverse leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently.The Funds are not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock's performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock's performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day.A levered and/or inverse single-stock ETF is not the same as holding the underlying stock, a traditional ETF, or even a non-single stock levered and/or inverse ETF. Unlike traditional ETFs, or other levered and/or inverse ETFs, the Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification.Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.Derivatives Risk: The Funds' use of derivatives may be considered aggressive and may expose the Funds to greater risks and larger losses or smaller gains than investing directly in the reference asset(s) underlying those derivatives. A derivative refers to any financial instrument whose value is derived, at least in part, from the price of an underlying security, asset, rate or index.Leverage Risk: Leverage increases the risk of a total loss of an investor's investment, may increase the volatility of the Funds, and may magnify any differences between the performance of the Funds and its referenced single stock or index. Because the Funds include a multiplier of, for example, positive two times (200%) or negative two times (-200%) of the underlying stock, a single day movement in that stock approaching 50% at any point in the day could result in the total loss of an investor's investment if that movement is contrary to the investment objective of the given Fund, even if the underlying stock subsequently moves in an opposite direction, eliminating all or a portion of the earlier movement. This would be the case with any such single day movements in the stock, even if the stock maintains a level greater than zero at all times.Compounding Risk: The Funds have a single day investment objective, and performance for any other period is the result of their returns for each day compounded over the period. The performance of the Funds for periods longer than a single day will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from, for example, 200% or -200% of the daily return of the underlying stock for the same period, before accounting for fees and expenses.Swap agreement risk: The Fund expects to use swap agreements as a means to achieve its investment objective, which may expose the Fund to greater risks and larger losses or smaller gains than investing directly in the reference asset(s) underlying those derivatives. Swaps are also subject to the risk of imperfect correlation between the value of the reference asset underlying the swap and the swap. The use of swap agreements are also subject to additional risks such as the lack of regulation, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and could expose investors to significant losses.Concentration Risk: The Fund will be concentrated (i.e., invest more than 25% of Fund assets) in the industries or group of industries within a single sector to the extent that the Index is so concentrated. A portfolio concentrated in one or more sectors may present more risks than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.Distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc, which is not affiliated with AXS Investments.

But consumers aren't always on the same timeline as investors. The market is currently pricing the stock near our downside scenario of our fair value estimates, where among other poor outcomes, we assume that competition takes a bite out of deliveries and cost reductions don't materialize at Tesla.

However, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk was quick to respond via his recently-acquired Twitter cautioning against citing 'unnamed sources' as they are frequently false. So where is Indonesia currently in the talks to attract Tesla into building an auto factory in the country? Home to the biggest nickel reserves in the world, Indonesia has been leveraging its potential to attract investment in battery and electric vehicle (EV) production. It is currently building an end-to-end EV battery production ecosystem, from mining to recycling, and seeking to expand it to an EV manufacturing ecosystem. In EV battery production, Indonesia has been receiving flocking interests, especially from Chinese companies. Indonesia's Morowali Industrial Park is home to the lithium-ion battery plant backed by subsidiary of China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's biggest EV battery manufacturer, and GEM Co., a supplier to Samsung Electronics, PT Indonesia's Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), China's Tsingshan and Japan's Hanhwa Co. Ltd, and has made its first shipment of 1,200 tons of nickel metal. Furthermore, the Morowali Industrial Park is also home to a refining facility run by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co., and the site of CNGR Advanced Material Co.'s future smelting plant. In August 2022, Tesla signed pricing agreements with Huayou and CNGR to supply ternary precursor materials produced in their factories in Indonesia and made from the country's nickel reserves. Huayou will supply the EV maker from July 1, 2022, to the end of 2025 and CNGR from 2023 to 2025. Meanwhile, for EV manufacturing, South Korea's automaker Hyundai had launched its plant in Indonesia in March last year and sold the country's first locally assembled EV in the market throughout 2022. China's Wuling Motors Holdings has also built assembly facilities in Indonesia and set a record for the most battery EV sold in the country in 2022. With an established EV battery production ecosystem where Tesla has made deals with and precedents from EV automakers that have built and sold their cars in the country, the discussion to have Tesla build its EV factory in Indonesia has been dragging for a long time, so the issue may not be production ecosystem unreadiness. Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said the country is preparing for some incentives to attract giant EV automakers, such as Tesla and China's BYD. However, he did not mention what has been dragging the deal finalization and the incentives prepared. What we've heard A source in the government said that the difficulties in Tesla's investment plan to build an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Indonesia was because the company owned by Elon Musk wanted to ensure that the nickel used as raw material for the batteries did not come from illegal mining. The source said that, apparently the illegal mining of nickel around Morowali and Konawe had caught Tesla's attention. The company then put forward conditions: it only wants to invest and build a car factory in Indonesia if the raw materials for the batteries don't come from illegal mining. That's why the lobbying team from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Investment ensured to Tesla that the battery raw materials to develop the EV ecosystem in Indonesia were all mined legally. If Tesla does invest in Indonesia, said the source, they will build electric vehicles to target emerging markets. They will set a price for an electric vehicle that is quite competitive with the price of the Wuling Air EV. This approach was taken because Tesla realized that the price of the electric cars they have been producing so far is too expensive for most consumers in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. However, another source said that Tesla's investment plans in Indonesia could still change. A source at BKPM said that the team from the Maritime Affairs and Investment Ministry had lobbied for Tesla to enter Indonesia, without involving other ministries or institutions. That is why many officials at BKPM admit that they are not aware of Elon Musk's plans to invest in building factories in Indonesia. They only found out about the plan after Maritime Affairs and Investment Coordinating Minister Luhut Panjaitan conveyed it at the regional head coordination meeting recently.

125,Tesla will invest $3.6B in Nevada truck factory expansion,Published Am Ct Jan.,2023-01-26 00:00:00,date,https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2023/01/26/tesla-will-invest--3-6b-in-nevada-truck-factory-expansion,spectrumlocalnews.com,The Truckee Reno Industrial Center will be expanded.,"SPARKS, Nev. (AP) — Tesla said it intends to invest $3.6 billion to expand manufacturing capabilities in Nevada and is confident growing software-related profits, reflected in record net income reported Wednesday for the fourth quarter of last year, will keep margins higher than any other automaker. The company confirmed it plans to produce high volumes of semi-trucks and make enough cell batteries for 2 million light-duty vehicles annually in Nevada.
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo posted a photo on Twitter of himself and CEO Elon Musk late Tuesday after the newly elected Republican announced in his first State of the State address Monday night that Tesla had committed to a 'brand-new"" manufacturing facility for electric trucks in northern Nevada.
The project actually will expand an existing operation at the Truckee Reno Industrial Center, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Reno-Sparks along Interstate 80. But the plan takes the company a step closer to accomplishing previously announced plans to ramp up Tesla Semi production to make 50,000 trucks in North America in 2024.
The White House issued a statement trumpeting the plans on Tuesday as Musk wrapped up three hours of testimony defending himself in a class-action lawsuit in a San Francisco federal court over his operation of Twitter, one of three major corporations he owns including Tesla and SpaceX.
Musk's impulsive and sometimes inflammatory usage of Twitter took center stage as proceedings continued Wednesday in the lawsuit alleging he misled Tesla shareholders in 2018 with a tweet about an aborted buyout.
Mitch Landrieu, President Joe Biden's infrastructure chief, said on Tuesday Tesla's additional investment in Nevada is proof of a continued 'manufacturing boom' since Biden took office two years ago. He said the expansion would create 3,000 jobs in Nevada while promoting clean energy and strengthening U.S. security.
Lombardo tweeted a photo late Tuesday of himself with Musk at Tesla's 'Gigafactory' in the industrial park east of Reno-Sparks, where it makes batteries for electric vehicles.
'This is an incredible investment in our state,' Lombardo wrote.
Elizabeth Ray, the governor's communications director, confirmed the photo's authenticity and clarified in an email to The Associated Press the new investment was for an 'expansion of the existing space' at the Truckee-Reno center.
Tesla's statement on its blog site late Tuesday said that since 2014 the company has invested $6.2 billion in Nevada and built the 5.4-million-square-foot (501,676-square-meter) 'Gigafactory.'
'We will be investing over $3.6 billion more to continue growing Gigafactory Nevada, adding 3,000 new team members and two new factories,' the company said, adding that it would include its 'first high-volume Semi factory.'
Tesla delivered its first electric semis to a PepsiCo facility in Nevada in December, more than three years after Musk said his company would start making the trucks.
At a November 2017 event unveiling the Tesla Semi, Musk said production would begin in 2019 and the trucks would be able to follow each other autonomously in a convoy. But during Tesla's third-quarter earnings conference call in October, he said the company's 'Full Self Driving' system was not quite ready to be driverless.
The truck has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilogram) load, Musk said.
The Austin, Texas, maker of electric vehicles and solar panels said on Wednesday it earned $3.69 billion from October through December, or an adjusted $1.19 per share. That beat estimates of $1.13 that had been reduced by analysts, according to FactSet. The company's profit was 59% more than the same period a year ago.
Revenue for the quarter was $24.32 billion, which fell short of the $24.67 billion analysts expected.
Musk said that despite price cuts of up to 20% on some vehicles announced earlier this month, demand for Tesla products is strong and sales are constrained by production.",mynews13.com,4349,news,US,en,"Associated Press,Published Am Ct Jan.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/tesla_trucks_nevadaap_01262023,False,,7.3937974,50ee7ac69e98e896efa9ed98247532e9

However, Tesla said it's on track to deliver about 1.8 million vehicles this year, which would represent a production jump of about 37%.On a call with analysts, chief executive Elon Musk said that outlook is conservative, saying that production could be closer to 2 million vehicles without unexpected disruptions. He sought to dispel questions about consumer demand for Tesla vehicles as the company ramps up production.'The most common questions we've been getting from investors is about demand. So I want to put that concern to rest,' Musk said, adding that Tesla is currently seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production following dramatic price cuts. 'Demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole, he said.'The automaker has become something of a bellwether for the global auto market as its deliveries grow and much of the industry shifts toward making battery-powered vehicles. It now has four auto plants on three continents, including its newest plant in Austin.The stock rose 5.4% in extended trading in New York.The Austin, Texas-based company reported adjusted earnings of $1.19 (€1.08) a share, besting the $1.12 a share average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.Tesla roughly doubled its production capacity in 2022. Its annualised production estimate for the fourth quarter was a new record, and near the company's total production capacity for the first time.Tesla also confirmed it's still on track to start building the long-awaited Cybertruck in Austin later this year, with more details of its next-generation vehicle platform planned at an investor day on March 1.Musk highlighted that Cybertruck production won't happen at volume until 2024. That gives rival vehicles more time to enjoy a first-mover advantage in the nascent electric truck market, including Ford's F-150 Lightning and Rivian's R1T.Tesla's fourth-quarter revenue was $24.3 billion, slightly topping market expectations. Gross automotive margins, however, were 25.9%, below analysts' average estimate of 28.4% – a sign of potential concern for investors following a recent round of price reductions. In the year-earlier period, the gross automotive margin was 30.6%.On the call, Musk said that 2022 was a difficult year due to shutdowns at Tesla's China factory, higher borrowing costs and logistical issues. He added that the company's recent price cuts were need to make car more affordable to mass-market buyers.Income from the sale of regulatory credits – used by other automakers to offset greenhouse gas emissions – came to $467 million, up from $286 million in the prior quarter and $314 million a year ago. Tesla has said it expects such revenue to shrink over time as competitors launch more EVs to comply with emissions regulations and meet growing demand.Musk's comments on Wednesday were his first session with analysts since he bought Twitter for $44 billion in late October. His move to fund that acquisition in part by selling shares of Tesla has weighed on the stock, which has fallen 53% over the past 12 months.Musk said his presence on Twitter and his purchase of the social-media company, which has been flagged as an expensive distraction, is a net positive, citing his 127 million followers on the platform.Tesla reported its second straight quarterly drop in customer deposits – down to $1.06 billion – after hitting an all-time high of $1.1 billion exiting the second quarter in 2022. – Bloomberg",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/gYwbHUiGnCGA4z8_IOt31xV5qVc=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/EZ37BWZN25FGBQTMBVBQYMKZ6Y.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,7.186752,4f99e71ddb619a03c98743caba9da387

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot after a series of crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. In June, the agency said evidence suggested drivers in most crashes with emergency vehicles under review had complied with Tesla's alert strategy that seeks to compel driver attention, raising questions about its effectiveness. NHTSA Acting Administrator Ann Carlson said earlier this month the agency was ""working really fast"" on its Autopilot probe. ""We're moving as quickly as we can, but we also want to be careful and make sure we have all the information we need,"" she said. In 2020, the National Transportation Safety Board criticized Tesla's ""ineffective monitoring of driver engagement"" after a 2018 fatal Autopilot crash. Autopilot enables cars to steer, accelerate and brake within their lanes without driver intervention but Tesla says the feature requires ""active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."" NHTSA has separately opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations where advanced systems including Autopilot were suspected of being used with 19 crash deaths reported.

128,Elon Musk defiantly defends himself in Tesla tweet trial,Michael Liedtke,2023-01-24 00:00:00,date,https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/01/24/elon-musk-defiantly-defends-himself-tesla-tweet-trial/,hawaiinewsnow.com,Elon Musk spent most of Tuesday trying to persuade the jurors that there was nothing devious about the two tweets indicating he had lined up the money to take Tesla private.,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk returned to federal court to defend himself against a class-action lawsuit that alleges he misled Tesla shareholders with a tweet about an aborted buyout that the billionaire defiantly insisted Tuesday he could have pulled off, had he wanted.Musk spent roughly three more hours on the stand during his third day of testimony before being excused by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen. It's unlikely Musk, 51, will be summoned back to the witness stand during a civil trial expected to be turned over to a nine-person jury in early February.Musk, who also owns Twitter while continuing to run Tesla, spent much of Tuesday depicting himself, while being questioned by his own attorney, Alex Spiro, as an impeccably trustworthy business leader capable of raising as much money as he needs to pursue his visions. He testily sparred with a shareholder lawyer, Nicholas Porritt, who had raised his ire earlier in the trial.At two separate junctures Tuesday under Spiro's gentle prodding, Musk left no doubt about his contempt for Porritt with a remark expressing doubt that the lawyer was looking out for the best interests of Tesla shareholders. The remarks drew a quick rebuke from the judge and were stricken from the record. 'It's inappropriate,' Chen at one point admonished Musk.When he was being challenged by Porritt, Musk purposefully diverted his gaze from the lawyer and delivered his explanations while looking directly at the jurors sitting a few feet to his right. In another instance, Musk asserted, without elaborating, that a question from Porritt wondering if he had ever caused investors to suffered losses contained 'falsehoods.'On the flip side, Spiro at one point mistakenly addressed Musk as 'your honor' while asking the billionaire how much money he had made for investors during his career. The slipup elicited a moment of levity in the San Francisco courtroom filled with media and other spectators in attendance to listen to Musk, who has become even more famous since completing his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October.The current trial hinges on whether a pair of tweets Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to his admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen. The statements resulted in Musk and Tesla to reach the $40 million settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.In the first of the 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion — or $420 per share — buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.After those tweets, Musk declared Tesla would remain publicly a few weeks later. A month after that, Musk and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement with securities regulators who had alleged the tweets were misleading.Musk has previously contended he entered into the settlement under duress and maintained he never wavered in his belief that he had the money for a deal.Musk spent most of Tuesday trying to persuade the jurors that there was nothing devious about the two tweets indicating he had lined up the money to take Tesla private as the electric automaker was struggling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. The judge has already declared the jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.While being steered by Spiro, Musk told jurors he had stated only that he was 'considering' a Tesla buyout but never promised a deal would get done. But, Musk said, he thought it important to get the word out to investors that Tesla might be poised to end its eight-year run as a publicly held company.'I had no ill motive,' Musk said. 'My intent was to do the right thing for all shareholders.'While being grilled the day before by Porritt, Musk at times was combative, indignant and exasperated. Through it all, Musk has insisted he locked up financial backing for what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla during 2018 meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, although no specific funding amount or price was discussed.When presented with texts and email indicating that a representative for the Saudi fund had never pledged the money for a full buyout of Tesla, Musk contended it was nothing more than the words of someone trying to backpedal from a previous pledge made in private conversations.Not long after Porritt resumed his questioning Tuesday, Musk once again scoffed at the notion that his belief that he had the Saudi funding's financial backing wasn't enough for him to tweet about a potential Tesla buyout.'We are talking about the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,' Musk testified. 'They can buy Tesla several times over. This was not a large amount of money for them.'Musk also reiterated earlier testimony that he could finance a Tesla buyout by sharing some of his holdings in SpaceX, a privately held maker of rocket ships that he also started. That would be similar to what he did in the Twitter purchase, which led him to sell about $23 billion of his Tesla stock.That's something that Musk said Tuesday that he didn't want to do, but that it showed he had the wherewithal to pull together purchases for expensive deals. Musk's ownership of Twitter also has proved unpopular with Tesla shareholders who worry about him being distracted as the automaker faces more competition. Tesla's stock has lost about one-third of its value since Musk took over Twitter.Despite that downturn, the stock is still worth about seven times more than at the time of Musk's 2018 tweets, after adjusting for two splits that have since occurred. That opened the door for Musk to remind jurors Tuesday that any investor who held Tesla shares in August 2018 would have done 'extremely well,' had they just held on to the stock.'It would have been the best investment in the stock market,' Musk said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

I didn't want to sell Tesla stock but I did sell Tesla stock,' he said of the stock sale to make up for the lack of funding from other sources for his $44 billion deal to take Twitter private.

Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders, asked Musk if he 'went with 420 because it was a joke your girlfriend enjoys.' Musk replied he thinks there is 'some karma' around the number 420 — which is also a slang reference to marijuana — although he added he doesn't know 'if it's good karma or bad karma at this point.'He then said the number was a 'coincidence' and it represented a 20% premium of Tesla's share price at the time.After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, without acknowledging any wrongdoing.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It's unlikely Musk, 51, will be summoned back to the witness stand during a civil trial expected to be turned over to a nine-person jury in early February.Musk, who also owns Twitter while continuing to run Tesla, spent much of Tuesday depicting himself, while being questioned by his own attorney, Alex Spiro, as an impeccably trustworthy business leader capable of raising as much money as he needs to pursue his visions. He testily sparred with a shareholder lawyer, Nicholas Porritt, who had raised his ire earlier in the trial.At two separate junctures Tuesday under Spiro's gentle prodding, Musk left no doubt about his contempt for Porritt with a remark expressing doubt that the lawyer was looking out for the best interests of Tesla shareholders. The remarks drew a quick rebuke from the judge and were stricken from the record. 'It's inappropriate,' Chen at one point admonished Musk.When he was being challenged by Porritt, Musk purposefully diverted his gaze from the lawyer and delivered his explanations while looking directly at the jurors sitting a few feet to his right. In another instance, Musk asserted, without elaborating, that a question from Porritt wondering if he had ever caused investors to suffered losses contained 'falsehoods.'On the flip side, Spiro at one point mistakenly addressed Musk as 'your honor' while asking the billionaire how much money he had made for investors during his career. The slipup elicited a moment of levity in the San Francisco courtroom filled with media and other spectators in attendance to listen to Musk, who has become even more famous since completing his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October.The current trial hinges on whether a pair of tweets Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to his admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen. The statements resulted in Musk and Tesla to reach the $40 million settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.In the first of the 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion — or $420 per share — buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.After those tweets, Musk declared Tesla would remain publicly a few weeks later. A month after that, Musk and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement with securities regulators who had alleged the tweets were misleading.Musk has previously contended he entered into the settlement under duress and maintained he never wavered in his belief that he had the money for a deal.Musk spent most of Tuesday trying to persuade the jurors that there was nothing devious about the two tweets indicating he had lined up the money to take Tesla private as the electric automaker was struggling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. The judge has already declared the jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.While being steered by Spiro, Musk told jurors he had stated only that he was 'considering' a Tesla buyout but never promised a deal would get done. But, Musk said, he thought it important to get the word out to investors that Tesla might be poised to end its eight-year run as a publicly held company.'I had no ill motive,' Musk said. 'My intent was to do the right thing for all shareholders.'While being grilled the day before by Porritt, Musk at times was combative, indignant and exasperated. Through it all, Musk has insisted he locked up financial backing for what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla during 2018 meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, although no specific funding amount or price was discussed.When presented with texts and email indicating that a representative for the Saudi fund had never pledged the money for a full buyout of Tesla, Musk contended it was nothing more than the words of someone trying to backpedal from a previous pledge made in private conversations.Not long after Porritt resumed his questioning Tuesday, Musk once again scoffed at the notion that his belief that he had the Saudi funding's financial backing wasn't enough for him to tweet about a potential Tesla buyout.'We are talking about the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,' Musk testified. 'They can buy Tesla several times over. This was not a large amount of money for them.'Musk also reiterated earlier testimony that he could finance a Tesla buyout by sharing some of his holdings in SpaceX, a privately held maker of rocket ships that he also started. That would be similar to what he did in the Twitter purchase, which led him to sell about $23 billion of his Tesla stock.That's something that Musk said Tuesday that he didn't want to do, but that it showed he had the wherewithal to pull together purchases for expensive deals. Musk's ownership of Twitter also has proved unpopular with Tesla shareholders who worry about him being distracted as the automaker faces more competition. Tesla's stock has lost about one-third of its value since Musk took over Twitter.Despite that downturn, the stock is still worth about seven times more than at the time of Musk's 2018 tweets, after adjusting for two splits that have since occurred. That opened the door for Musk to remind jurors Tuesday that any investor who held Tesla shares in August 2018 would have done 'extremely well,' had they just held on to the stock.'It would have been the best investment in the stock market,' Musk said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

I didn't want to sell Tesla stock but I did sell Tesla stock,' he said of the stock sale to make up for the lack of funding from other sources for his $44 billion deal to take Twitter private. Musk sold nearly $23 billion worth of his car company's shares between last April when he started building a position in Twitter, and December.'My SpaceX shares alone would have meant that funding was secured,' Musk said of the 2018 tweets.Even before Musk took the stand on Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.In the first of the 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for a what would have been a $72 billion — or $420 per share — buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders, asked Musk if he 'went with 420 because it was a joke your girlfriend enjoys.' Musk replied he thinks there is 'some karma' around the number 420 — which is also a slang reference to marijuana — although he added he doesn't know 'if it's good karma or bad karma at this point.'He then said the number was a 'coincidence' and it represented a 20% premium of Tesla's share price at the time.After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, without acknowledging any wrongdoing.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

That opened the door for Musk to remind jurors Tuesday that any investor who held Tesla shares in August 2018 would have done 'extremely well,' had they just held on to the stock.'It would have been the best investment in the stock market,' Musk said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

142,"Tesla Posts Solid Earnings, Reports Strong Orders to Start 2023",Sandy Ward,2023-01-26 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1133523/tesla-posts-solid-earnings-reports-strong-orders-to-start-2023,morningstar.com,Musk says Tesla well positioned for coming recession; stock undervalued.,"Tesla TSLA reported its 'best year ever on every level' for the full year 2022 and said that so far in January the electric vehicle maker is seeing the strongest orders 'ever in our history.' Morningstar equity analyst Seth Goldstein called the results 'solid' and reiterated his fair value estimate of $220 per share on the automaker. At the current $157.92, Goldstein considers Tesla's stock to be undervalued. For 2022, Tesla reported net income of 12.6 billion, or $3.62 per share, on revenue of $81.5 billion, compared with $5.5 billion, or $1.63 per share, on revenue of $53.8 billion in 2021. Yet Tesla—which chief executive Elon Musk now bills as an artificial intelligence company—fell short of expectations in the fourth quarter despite the results showing substantial year-over-year gains. Revenue came in just under Wall Street estimates but jumped 33% from year-ago levels to $24.3 billion, close to the $24.7 billion expected, according to data provider FactSet. Net income of $3.7 billion fell short of the $4 billon expected but was up nearly 60%. Tesla posted earnings per share of $1.07, less than the $1.13 expected. Musk Sees Recession in 2023 Musk cautioned the United States will 'probably have a pretty difficult recession this year.' While a recession could affect demand, it would also lead to lower input costs and improve margins, he noted. Musk said Tesla is in a good position to withstand what could be a 'severe' recession because it has little debt and $22 billion in cash on its balance sheet. In a conference call following the release of earnings, Musk returned repeatedly to his concerns about recession. Tesla Key Q4 Earnings Takeaways Revenue: $24.3 billion versus FactSet estimate of $24.7 billionNet income: $3.7 billion versus FactSet estimate of $4 billion.Earnings per share: $1.07 versus FactSet estimate of $1.13.Auto gross margin 25.9% in fourth quarter and 28.5% for full year.Puts 2023 production at 1.8 million cars, potentially 2 million Musk forecast the company will produce 1.8 million cars, and potentially 2 million, this year based on demand. The company raised the price of its Y model as a result of the strong demand. Musk addressed concerns about the company's strategy of cutting prices to spur demand in China by saying 'price really matters' and noted that 'it has always been our goal to make cars as affordable as possible.' Tesla Stock Fair Value Estimate Morningstar's Goldstein noted, however, that his $220 fair value estimate on Tesla stock now reflects a lower average selling price and profitability, offset by higher volumes. He says higher raw materials costs in the fourth quarter resulted in a quarterly contraction in the automotive gross profit margin, excluding regulatory credits. Automotive gross margins fell to 25.9% in the quarter, compared with 27.9% in the third quarter and 30.6% in the year-earlier period. 'Given Tesla's price declines announced in early January, and our view that lithium contract prices will rise in 2023—as spot prices average $70,000 per metric ton—we expect automotive gross profit margins to contract further in 2023, partially offset by lower nonlithium raw materials prices in the second half of the year as Tesla's sourcing contracts reset,' Goldstein said. 'Over the long term we expect Tesla to drive gross margin improvement from lower raw materials prices and the full ramp-up of its new plants, including rising production of its in-house 4680 battery cell manufacturing operation.' Tesla Stock Key Stats: Sector: Consumer CyclicalIndustry: Auto — ManufacturersFair Value Estimate: $220Morningstar Rating: 4 StarsEconomic Moat Rating: NarrowMoat Trend: Stable Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla's chief financial officer, said the company was most focused on operating margins, noting that its energy business is growing faster than its vehicle business. Tesla's operating margin fell to 16% in the quarter from 17.2% in the third quarter but rose from 14.7% a year earlier. The company said it is 'making progress' on improving cost controls at its Berlin and Austin plants and that 'costs were dropping' commensurate with a rise in production. Tesla Says Cybertruck on Its Way Production of its long-awaited Cybertruck is set to begin this summer but the company emphasized that volume won't ramp up until sometime next year. On whether Tesla is facing brand risk from Musk's ownership of social media platform Twitter, and his active and sometimes controversial social media account, Musk said his 127 million followers was proof of his popularity and that Twitter was 'a powerful tool' to drive demand for Teslas. 'The net value of Twitter is gigantic,' he said.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,Sandy Ward,https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/ROHC7ZXJXZU7LIKGTTYJTD667I.png,False,@MorningstarInc,6.8496747,cd780c576f186ac823655c404757f42a
143,Elon Musk: Tweets about taking Tesla private weren't fraud,The Associated Press,2023-01-23 00:00:00,date,https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/01/23/elon-musk-testifies-2nd-day-tesla-tweet-trial/,hawaiinewsnow.com,Elon Musk returned to federal court Monday in San Francisco to testify in a class action lawsuit filed by Tesla investors.,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk returned to federal court Monday in San Francisco, testifying that he believed he had locked up financial backing to take Tesla private during 2018 meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — although no specific funding amount or price was discussed.The 51-year-old billionaire Tesla CEO and Twitter owner is facing a class action lawsuit filed by Tesla investors alleging he misled them with a tweet saying funding was secured to take his electric car company private — for $420 per share.But the deal never came close to happening, and the tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators.The trial hinges on the question of whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to Musk's admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen.Speaking in a soft halting tone, Musk said Monday he 'had trouble sleeping last night and unfortunately I am not at my best.' He added that it was important for jurors to know that he 'felt that funding was secured' due to his ownership of 'SpaceX stock alone.''Just as I sold stock in Tesla to buy Twitter. ... I didn't want to sell Tesla stock but I did sell Tesla stock,' he said of the sale to make up for lack of funding from other sources for his $44 billion deal to take Twitter private. Musk sold nearly $23 billion worth of his car company's shares between last April, when he started building a position in Twitter, and December.'My SpaceX shares alone would have meant that funding was secured,' Musk said of the 2018 tweets.Even before Musk first took the stand on Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses.Musk has previously contended he entered into the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.At a July 31, 2018 meeting, the Saudi Public Investment Fund's Yasir Al-Rumayyan 'confirmed unequivocally that they would support Tesla going private. That was part of what ‘funding secure' meant,' Musk said Monday. 'But in addition there was SpaceX stock, which could also be used.'In the first of the 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion — or $420 per share — buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders, asked Musk if he 'went with 420 because it was a joke your girlfriend enjoys.' Musk replied he thinks there is 'some karma' around the number 420 — which is also a slang reference to marijuana — although he added he doesn't know 'if it's good karma or bad karma at this point.'He then said the number was a 'coincidence' and it represented a 20% premium of Tesla's share price at the time.After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of the SEC settlement, without acknowledging wrongdoing.On Friday, Musk had testified he thinks it is possible to be 'absolutely truthful' on Twitter. 'But can you be comprehensive? Of course not.'On Monday, he again emphasized: 'My tweet was truthful, absolutely truthful.'Asked by his lawyer, Alex Spiro, if he understood the charges against him, Musk said he's being 'accused of fraud. It's outrageous.'Shares of Tesla climbed $8.76. or 6.6%, to $142.18 on Monday. He said he never deceived investors.—AP Technology Writer Matt O'Brien contributed to this story.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

I lost $10,810'",Insider,2023-01-25 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/25/tesla-buyers-unhappy-with-discounts/,autoblog.com,"Forty people contacted Insider to express dissatisfaction about missing out on Model 3 and Model Y price cuts. One said they felt ""cheated.""","Tesla has slashed prices of its Model 3 and Model Y. Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images Tesla buyers are venting their frustration about missing out on big price cuts announced by the company in recent weeks, with one saying they felt ""cheated,"" and another, ""taken advantage of."" Forty people contacted Insider to express their dissatisfaction about missing out on Model 3 and Model Y price reductions, following a story Saturday by this publication about a buyer who secured a discount on his pending order. Aaron Brewer, from Oahu, Hawaii, placed an order at a Honolulu dealership on December 7 for a Model 3 after Tesla reduced the price of that car, and the Model Y, by $3,750. He said a sales representative told him Tesla ""almost never discounts anything."" Later in December, Tesla deepened the discount on both models, to $7,500, and two weeks into 2023 it cut prices further. Brewer said it was ""really painful for that euphoric feeling of being so happy with the car to be taken away and replaced with a sense of being taken advantage of"" to the tune of ""several thousand dollars."" Insider has viewed emails confirming Brewer's order and those of other people quoted in this story. Deborah Martin, from Los Alamitos, California, said she ordered her seven-seater Model Y Long Range in early January to benefit from the electric-vehicle federal tax credit of $7,500, and was told to expect delivery between January 12 and March. ""I was told by the dealership that if I didn't take delivery by January 12, the car would be given to the next person on the list,"" she said. She paid $76,440 for the vehicle, which included the Enhanced Autopilot system. The same configuration she ordered is now priced at $65,630, she said: ""So within 24 hours, not including tax, I lost $10,810."" A buyer who didn't want to be named for privacy reasons paid $69,000 for a Model Y and took delivery on October 1 after waiting for a year. Following the recent price cuts, the car now starts at $52,990, down from its previous base price of $65,990. ""It feels like you have been cheated and robbed,"" the buyer said. ""It feels like we are helpless. It doesn't seem fair to a hardworking family with two kids to rob them of their six months' savings."" Many of the people who reached out to Insider said they'd attempted to contact Tesla representatives through the company's app or on Twitter. Some said they'd even reached out directly to Musk.

147,Elon Musk says Twitter misadventure helped Tesla. Wall Street isn't buying it.,Insider,2023-01-28 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/28/elon-musk-says-twitter-misadventure-helped-tesla/,autoblog.com,"Elon Musk tried to spin his Twitter dalliances as a good marketing strategy for Tesla, but analysts say it's a costly distraction.","Elon Musk acquired Twitter on October 27, 2022. Getty Images Elon Musk made a much-awaited appearance at Tesla's fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, after the closing bell. True to form, the CEO tweeted from the earnings call in real time, even as he doled out favorable stats on the current state of the company that sought to put to rest the notion that demand for Tesla's cars is flagging: the January order rate is nearly twice the rate of production, Musk said, and the company expects to deliver 1.8 million vehicles by the end of the year.  The other Tesla execs showered investors with as many upsides as possible to counteract the negative press surrounding Musk, the carmaker's Technoking. Yet still an analyst wanted to know how the new owner of Twitter was going to mitigate the brand damage brought on by his loose fingers. Musk's response was to mention his 127 million followers on the platform as a sign that he is, in his own words, ""reasonably popular"" and that ""Twitter is an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla."" ""And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter,"" he added. ""The net value of Twitter, apart from a few people complaining, is gigantic, obviously."" To some degree, the attempt to smooth things over worked, with a number of Wall Street analysts issuing buy ratings on Tesla following the earnings call. Tesla's stock rose over 10% on its fourth quarter earnings results. Investors are momentarily at ease but still cautious of the uncertainty surrounding the economy and, of course, what Tesla's CEO will do next. But they also want it to be known that they're not buying into Musk's spin on his Twitter escapades. Wall Street is bullish on Tesla, but bearish on Musk Tesla's $24.3 billion in revenues for the fourth quarter outperformed Wall Street's estimates of $24.2 billion. Another upside was the earnings per share of $1.19, which beat the Street's estimates of $1.13. Tesla took hits on its margins due in part to the price cuts it performed on its vehicle lineup, and from the expansion of its Nevada factories.  Goldman Sachs equity analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note to clients that the company's stock will outperform the market with a price target of $200. However, Delaney asserted that one big challenge to his thesis was a ""key person risk,"" an apparent reference to Musk. John Murphy at Bank of America considers Musk's ""regular media updates on Twitter"" a headwind for the stock because it serves ""as a distraction for TSLA management."" All in all, however, Murphy believes the company sits at a fair valuation and took a neutral position on the stock. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities remains bullish on Tesla. While he's often been a critic of its top brass, seemed to praise Musk for not shying away from the concerns surrounding Twitter, and stated that the CEO is ""embracing the complex spider-web relationship between Twitter and Tesla which will have a mixed reaction from investors."" Wall Street thinks Twitter is a costly distraction Musk is not wrong in that he and Tesla are reasonably popular on Twitter. Musk's 127 thousand follower count is second to former US President Barack Obama's 133 thousand. Additionally, Tesla, with over 19 million followers, outpaces any other car company's account on the platform. (At a glance, BMW's 2.4 million followers seems the closest.)  But how many of Musk's and Tesla's followers converted to sales based on the content coming from those accounts? And how many of those followers are bots, rarely used accounts, or there to gawk at the side show of the CEO billionaire? That's a part of the question Musk did not answer during the call. Whether Musk and company wants to admit it; whatever the Technoking says and does on- and off-line has affected Tesla's brand, and therefore its stock.  Tesla's stock price fell not long after Musk announced the Twitter deal and reports revealed that he would use his Tesla shares to help finance the deal. Musk tried to lift the stock by saying he wouldn't use Tesla shares, but that turned into a hard promise to keep. Musk is said to have sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares last year to support the debt and equity purchase of Twitter for $44 billion. The company's stock fell more after the acquisition finished in October and once again when news of Musk's brutal company restructuring made headlines. By the end of 2022, the stock had lost more than half (62%, to be precise) of its value since April. Musk's tweets have also landed him in trouble with investors and Tesla owners. Last week, he took the stand at a shareholders trial to defend his infamous 2018 ""funding secured"" tweet. Insider has previously reported that Tesla owners and investors have been so ruffled by Musk's controversial tweets that some have ditched the brand. But Tesla's stock was facing more than Twitter drama last year. The company was dealing with supply-chain issues, inflation, and changes to the Inflation Reduction Act. On top of all that, consumers' pockets were tightening from uncertainty around the future of the economy, causing a slump in demand. As in most things, there's always more to the story — but you can't deny the impact of Musk's Twitter habits, either. Many of the analysts said they're looking forward to Tesla's Investor Day on March 1 where the company will share more about its growth plans. Ives pointed out, the Twitter noise is starting to dissipate and the demand story will be front and center for 2023.

148,Musk tells Tesla securities fraud jury he has ‘no trouble' raising money,,2023-01-25 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/01/25/musk-has-securities-fraud-jury-he-has-no-trouble-raising-money/,irishtimes.com,"Meanwhile, Tesla announces plans for expansion of Nevada Gigafactory complex","Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has no problem raising money, a jury in a securities fraud trial in San Francisco heard.In his third day on the witness stand, Musk was defending the legitimacy of his assertion in an August 2018 tweet that he had 'funding secured for the take-private transaction.'Every financing round I've had has been oversubscribed,' he testified Tuesday in response to friendly questions from his own lawyer. 'It's not a problem for me to raise money. I've done a good job for investors and if you do a good job, they give you money.'Mr Musk spent most of his approximately four hours on the stand the previous day facing off with a lawyer for investors who claim the billionaire's Twitter posts in August 2018 were misleading — and caused shareholders who made bets on his tweets to suffer big losses.While investor attorney Nicholas Porritt was trying to show that the short-lived take-private proposal was empty, lacking the most fundamental details, Mr Musk told jurors he was certain about the funding. He testified about the possibility of using his holdings in SpaceX to help finance the transaction, along with a multibillion-dollar commitment by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.Mr Musk also said that his actual language in the tweet on August 7th, 2018 — 'Considering taking Tesla private — was not the same as saying 'the deal will be done.He said Tuesday the aim in his tweets was to be transparent and 'do the right thing with Tesla shareholders.'I'm making it very clear that either scenario is possible,' he said. 'We may go private or we may not.'Mr Musk testified that Dan Dees, a Goldman Sachs Group executive who he'd been talking to about the take-private plan, was very complimentary about how Mr Musk explained his rationale in a Tesla blog post on the same day as his tweet.Mr Musk told jurors that Tesla's relationship with JPMorgan Chase & Co had gone south.He testified that he 'withdrew all commercial banking business from JPMorgan, which to say the least made JPMorgan hate Tesla and me'.Mr Musk generally performed stronger as a witness Tuesday than he did Monday, when he confessed in court that he'd gotten a poor night's sleep and complained in his fourth hour on the stand that he was suffering from back pain.Mr Porritt wasn't able to land as many blows to Musk's narrative in the final hour of the CEO's testimony Tuesday before he was excused.But Mr Porritt did get Musk to grudgingly acknowledge that he never got commitments for specific funding amounts for the Tesla take-private transaction from the Saudi fund — or any bank or person.'Not a specific number,' Mr Musk said. He'd previously testified he believed the Public Investment Fund's support was 'unequivocal, and added Tuesday that 'PIF can take Tesla private 150 times over'.Mr Musk was also confronted over his failure to mention the possibility of tapping into SpaceX shares when he submitted a written explanation to the court in 2021 about the state-of-play for financing the take-private deal in 2018. Musk said Tuesday that he'd mentioned SpaceX to the Securities and Exchange Commission in its 2018 probe of the tweets, but forgot to bring it up in the current case before Monday.'It was an error on my part in not mentioning it here,' he said.Later, Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha, testified that Mr Musk's tweets triggered a barrage of queries to him about whether 'this a real event or is this made up'. He said that before the tweets came out, he had no experience with privatisation in his previous work as a side-sell analyst.Mr Viecha said he told many investors the take-private plan was indeed a 'firm offer', but didn't clear that language with Tesla's chief financial officer or others at the company.'It was my understanding that Saudi PIF would be taking over the company,' Mr Viecha testified. 'I don't actually know if there was a commitment letter or if there was a verbal agreement.'Separately, Tesla said on Tuesday it would invest more than $3.6 billion to expand its Nevada Gigafactory complex with two new factories, one to mass produce its long-delayed Semi electric truck and the other to make its new 4680 battery cell.The cell plant would be able to make enough batteries for 2 million light-duty vehicles annually, including batteries using the 4680-type cell. The 4680 is key to Tesla meeting a goal of halving battery costs and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030.Together, the facilities will employ about 3,000 people, extending the electric vehicle maker's complex east of Reno, where it runs a battery joint venture with Japan's Panasonic and makes vehicle parts and power backup systems.Panasonic currently supplies cells to the gigafactory, and Tesla assembles them into battery packs there.Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the 4680 at its factories in Fremont, California, and Austin, Texas.Experts say the dry-coating technique used to produce the bigger cells in these batteries is new and unproven and the company has been having trouble scaling up manufacturing to the point where the big cost savings kick in.The move suggests Tesla is finally committing to large-scale production of the Semi, which was initially supposed to begin rolling out of factory doors in 2019. Tesla made the first Semi deliveries in December to PepsiCo but there is no sign of a high rate of output of the model.Other customers that have ordered Semis include brewer Anheuser-Busch, United Parcel Service and Walmart.The Semi is a truck for 18-wheel semi-trailer vehicles and has a range of 800km on a single charge with a gross weight of 37 tonnes, including trailer and cargo.Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in November that Tesla might produce 100 Semis in 2022, but the company disclosed no figure for the model in its fourth-quarter production report.The EV maker aimed to produce 50,000 Semis in 2024, Mr Musk said on a post-earnings call in October. - Bloomberg, Reuters",irishtimes.com,798,finance,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/HySXt_RMSy9seovg-EmWb4Ti_yU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/MJFEX7M2YPVPJNHPMNOENMBJ5U.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.39818,0244ffa43820a70e746bc66bff431d1f

By India Today Web Desk: Twitter chief Elon Musk told a San Francisco court that he believed he had secured the funds to take Tesla private in 2018 and could have used his stake in rocket company SpaceX to fund a buyout.Musk's response came during a court hearing in a lawsuit filed by Tesla investors alleging that he misled them with a tweet saying funding was secured to take Tesla private for $420 per share. In his 2018 tweet, Musk said funding has been secured for $72 billion of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. He later said the deal was imminent. READ | Elon Musk criticises Covid vaccines and says he felt like dying after his second booster shot""With SpaceX stock alone, I felt funding was secured for the buyout,"" he told a jury, referring to SpaceX. He added later that he chose not to take Tesla private due to a lack of support from some investors and a wish to avoid a lengthy process.As it turned out, the ""deal"" never happened and his statements allegedly saddled investors with losses.ALSO READ | No toilet rolls, rent not paid, kitchens closed: Elon Musk's Twitter is going through a rough phaseA jury will now decide whether the Tesla CEO artificially inflated the company's share price by touting the buyout's prospects, and if so by how much.'SOME KARMA'Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders, asked Musk if he went with 420 because ""it was a joke your girlfriend enjoys. Elon Musk replied he thinks there is 'some karma' around the number 420 — which is also a slang reference to marijuana — although he added he doesn't know 'if it's good karma or bad karma at this point.'He then said the number was a 'coincidence' and it represented a 20% premium of Tesla's share price at the time.After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman while remaining CEO as part of a settlement, without acknowledging wrongdoing.

155,Elon Musk's third day of testimony: 'I had no ill motive' in Tesla buyout tweet,Associated Press,2023-01-24 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/24/elon-musk-i-had-no-ill-motive-testimony-tesla-shareholder-lawsuit/,autoblog.com,"Elon Musk testified for a third day in a Tesla investors lawsuit, saying he tweeted simply to let shareholders know he was considering a buyout.","SAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk returned to the stand for a third day Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit brought by Tesla investors who allege he misled them with a tweet about a deal that never happened, testifying that his intent had been to let his shareholders know he was considering a buyout. The 51-year-old billionaire resumed — under the friendly questioning of his own lawyer, Alex Spiro — his staunch defense at a trial centering on two 2018 tweets indicating he had lined up the money to take Tesla private. As Spiro gently prodded him, Musk told the nine-person jury he had stated only that he was 'considering"" a Tesla buyout but never promised a deal would get done. But, Musk said, he thought it important to get the word out to investors that Tesla might be poised to end its eight-year run as a publicly held company. 'I had no ill motive,"" Musk said. 'My intent was to do the right thing for all shareholders."" While being grilled the day before by an attorney representing Tesla shareholders, Musk at times was combative, indignant and exasperated. Through it all, Musk has insisted he had locked up financial backing for what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla during 2018 meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, although no specific funding amount or price was discussed. When presented with texts and email indicating that a representative for the Saudi fund had never pledged the money for a full buyout of Tesla, Musk contended it was nothing more than the words of someone trying to backpedal from a previous pledge made in private conversations. Surfacing while Musk was on the stand Tuesday was his contempt for the attorneys who sued on behalf of Tesla shareholders who owned stock in the company for a 10-day period in August 2018. 'I don't believe they actually represent shareholders,' Musk sneered, drawing a rebuke from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, who ordered the remark stricken from the record. In the class action lawsuit, Tesla investors allege Musk, who has since taken Twitter in a $44 billion buyout, misled them with a tweet saying funding was secured to take his electric car company private — for $420 per share. But the deal never came close to happening, and the tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. Musk has previously contended he entered into the settlement under duress and maintained he never wavered in his belief that he had the money for a deal. He pointed Tuesday to his nearly 30-year track record as an entrepreneur who has never had trouble raising money from a litany of past ventures that have included PayPal and Neuralink, in addition to Tesla and SpaceX. 'It's not a problem for me to raise money,' Musk said, chuckling. 'I have done a good job for investors, and when you do a good job for investors, they give you money.' The trial hinges on whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to Musk's admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn't going to happen. The statements resulted in Musk and Tesla to reach the $40 million settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing. In the first of the 2018 tweets, Musk stated 'funding secured' for what would have been a $72 billion — or $420 per share — buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grappling with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.",autoblog.com,1835,news,GB,en,Associated Press,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/d8d298c0-9c15-11ed-afda-0d3f2b039830,False,@therealautoblog,6.1811485,3d7c1e93eb44135f06f3405f0998508c

Wang Gang/VCG via Getty Images Shares of Nio and other U.S.-listed Chinese electric car makers revved up Thursday as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said its largest rival will likely come from China.  ""[The] Chinese market is the most competitive. They work the hardest and they work the smartest,"" he said during a call with analysts late Wednesday after Tesla reported record quarterly earnings.  There is ""probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla,"" he added in venturing a guess about which company could be Tesla's largest competitor.  Alongside a rally in Tesla shares, Nio stock gained 3.2%, Li Auto charged up 7%, XPeng advanced by 3.4%, and BYD gained 4.8%. Investing legend Warren Buffet has a stake in BYD, whose models include the Song compact SUV.  Tesla, whose lineup includes Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, jumpstarted a price war in China, the world's largest auto market, by reducing prices in October and in January.  The price changes ""really make a difference for the average consumer,"" Musk said in his call with analysts. Tesla posted a record fourth-quarter profit of about $3.7 billion. Its per-share earnings of $1.19 were higher than a Refinitiv consensus forecast of $1.05.  Tesla shares climbed by more than 10% during Thursday's trading session to surpass $161 a share.  Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his Tesla price target to $200 from $175 and said Tesla has a beatable vehicle-delivery target of 1.8 million in 2023.

The tweets sent the Tesla share price on a rollercoaster ride, and Musk was sued by shareholders who said the tycoon acted recklessly in an effort to squeeze investors who had bet against the company. Jurors deliberated for barely two hours before returning to the San Francisco courtroom to say they unanimously agreed that neither Musk nor the Tesla board perpetrated fraud with the tweets and in their aftermath. ""Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!"" tweeted Musk, who had tried but failed to get the trial moved to Texas on the grounds jurors in California would be biased against him. ""I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case."" Attorney Nicholas Porritt, who represents Glen Littleton and other investors in Tesla, had argued in court that the case was about making sure the rich and powerful have to abide by the same stock market rules as everyone else. ""Elon Musk published tweets that were false with reckless disregard as to their truth,"" Porritt told the panel of nine jurors during closing arguments. Porritt pointed to expert testimony estimating that Musk's claim about funding, which turned out not to be true, cost investors billions of dollars overall and that Musk and the Tesla board should be made to pay damages. ALSO READ | Tesla share price: US fraud trial begins over Elon Musk's 2018 tweets But Musk attorney Alex Spiro successfully countered that the billionaire may have erred on wording in a hasty tweet, but that he did not set out to deceive anyone. Spiro also portrayed the mercurial entrepreneur, who now owns Twitter, as having had a troubled childhood and having come to the United States as a poor youth chasing dreams. No joke Musk testified during three days on the witness stand that his 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private at $420 a share was no joke and that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was serious about helping him do it. ""To Elon Musk, if he believes it or even just thinks about it then it's true no matter how objectively false or exaggerated it may be,"" Porritt told jurors. Tesla and its board were also to blame, because they let Musk use his Twitter account to post news about the company, Porritt argued. The case revolved around a pair of tweets in which Musk said ""funding secured"" for a project to buy out the publicly-traded electric automaker, then in a second tweet added that ""investor support is confirmed."" ""He wrote two words 'funding secured' that were technically inaccurate,"" Spiro said of Musk while addressing jurors. ""Whatever you think of him, this isn't a bad tweeter trial, it's a 'did they prove this man committed fraud? trial."" ALSO READ | Elon Musk's next drama: a trial over his tweets about Tesla Musk did not intend to deceive anyone with the tweets, and had the connections and wealth to take Tesla private, Spiro contended. During the trial playing out in federal court in San Francisco, Spiro said that even though the tweets may have been a ""reckless choice of words,"" they were not fraud. ""I'm being accused of fraud; it's outrageous,"" Musk said while testifying in person. Musk said he fired off the tweets at issue after learning of a Financial Times story about a Saudi Arabian investment fund wanting to acquire a stake in Tesla. The trial came at a sensitive time for Musk, who has dominated the headlines for his chaotic takeover of Twitter where he has laid off more than half of the 7,500 employees and scaled down content moderation.

SAN FRANCISCO: Jurors on Friday cleared Elon Musk of liability for investors' losses in a fraud trial over his 2018 tweets falsely claiming that he had funding in place to take Tesla private.

The tweets sent the Tesla share price on a rollercoaster ride, and Musk was sued by shareholders who said the tycoon acted recklessly in an effort to squeeze investors who had bet against the company.

Jurors deliberated for barely two hours before returning to the San Francisco courtroom to say they unanimously agreed that neither Musk nor the Tesla board perpetrated fraud with the tweets and in their aftermath.

""Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!"" tweeted Musk, who had tried but failed to get the trial moved to Texas on the grounds jurors in California would be biased against him.

""I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.""

Attorney Nicholas Porritt, who represents Glen Littleton and other investors in Tesla, had argued in court that the case was about making sure the rich and powerful have to abide by the same stock market rules as everyone else.

""Elon Musk published tweets that were false with reckless disregard as to their truth,"" Porritt told the panel of nine jurors during closing arguments.

Porritt pointed to expert testimony estimating that Musk's claim about funding, which turned out not to be true, cost investors billions of dollars overall and that Musk and the Tesla board should be made to pay damages.

But Musk attorney Alex Spiro successfully countered that the billionaire may have erred on wording in a hasty tweet, but that he did not set out to deceive anyone.

Spiro also portrayed the mercurial entrepreneur, who now owns Twitter, as having had a troubled childhood and having come to the United States as a poor youth chasing dreams.

No joke

Musk testified during three days on the witness stand that his 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private at $420 a share was no joke and that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was serious about helping him do it.

""To Elon Musk, if he believes it or even just thinks about it then it's true no matter how objectively false or exaggerated it may be,"" Porritt told jurors.

Tesla and its board were also to blame, because they let Musk use his Twitter account to post news about the company, Porritt argued.

The case revolved around a pair of tweets in which Musk said ""funding secured"" for a project to buy out the publicly-traded electric automaker, then in a second tweet added that ""investor support is confirmed.""

""He wrote two words 'funding secured' that were technically inaccurate,"" Spiro said of Musk while addressing jurors.

""Whatever you think of him, this isn't a bad tweeter trial, it's a 'did they prove this man committed fraud? trial.""

Musk did not intend to deceive anyone with the tweets, and had the connections and wealth to take Tesla private, Spiro contended.

During the trial playing out in federal court in San Francisco, Spiro said that even though the tweets may have been a ""reckless choice of words,"" they were not fraud.

""I'm being accused of fraud; it's outrageous,"" Musk said while testifying in person.

Musk said he fired off the tweets at issue after learning of a Financial Times story about a Saudi Arabian investment fund wanting to acquire a stake in Tesla.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SAN FRANCISO (AP) — A jury on Friday decided Elon Musk didn't defraud investors with his 2018 tweets about electric automaker Tesla in a proposed deal that quickly unraveled and raised questions about whether the billionaire had misled investors. The nine-member jury reached its verdict after less that two hours of deliberation following a three-week trial. It represents a major vindication for Musk, who spent about eight hours on the witness stand defending his motives for the August 2018 tweets at the center of the trial. Musk, 51, wasn't on hand for the brief reading of the verdict but he made a surprise appearance earlier Friday for closing arguments that drew starkly different portraits of him. Not long after the verdict came down, Musk took to Twitter — the bully pulpit he now owns — to celebrate. 'Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!' Musk tweeted. Musk's decision to break away from his other responsibilities to sit in on the closing arguments even though he didn't have to be there may have had an impact on the jurors, said Michael Freedman, a former federal prosecutor who is now in private practice working for a law firm that has represented celebrities and business executives. 'It shows he has a presence,' Freedman said. Nicholas Porritt, an attorney who represented aggrieved Tesla investors, said he was disappointed after urging the jurors in his closing arguments to rebuke Musk for reckless behavior that threatened to create 'anarchy."" 'I don't think this is the kind of conduct we expect from a large public company,' a downcast Porritt said after discussing the verdict with a few jurors who gathered to talk to him. 'People can draw their own conclusion on whether they think it's OK or not.' During their discussion with Porritt, the jurors told them they found Musk's testimony that he believed he had lined up the money from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund without a written commitment to be credible. They also expressed doubt about whether Musk's tweeting was the sole reason for the swings in Tesla's stock price during a 10-day period in August 2018 covered in the case. The trial pitted Tesla investors represented in a class-action lawsuit against Musk, who is CEO of both the electric automaker and the Twitter service he bought for $44 billion a few months ago. Shortly before boarding his private jet on Aug. 7, 2018, Musk tweeted that he had the financing to take Tesla private, even though it turned out he hadn't gotten an iron-clad commitment for a deal that would have cost $20 billion to $70 billion to pull off. A few hours later, Musk sent another tweet indicating that the deal was imminent. Musk's integrity was at stake at the trial as well part of a fortune that has established him as one of the world's richest people. He could have been saddled with a bill for billions of dollars in damages had the jury found him liable for the 2018 tweets that had already been deemed falsehoods by the judge presiding over the trial. That determination, made last year by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, left the jury to decide whether Musk had been reckless with his tweeting and acted in a way that hurt Tesla shareholders. 'It may have not been that difficult for the jury,' Freedman said, 'because it sort of became like an up-or-down vote."" Earlier Friday, Musk sat stoically in court during the trial's closing arguments while he was both vilified as a rich and reckless narcissist and hailed as a visionary looking out for the 'little guy."" Over the course of a one-hour presentation, Porritt had implored the jurors to rebuke Musk for his 'loose relationship with the truth.' 'Our society is based on rules,' Porritt said. 'We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else.' Alex Spiro, Musk's attorney, conceded the 2018 tweets were 'technically inaccurate.' But he told the jurors, 'Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't make it a fraud.' During roughly eight hours on the stand earlier in the trial, Musk insisted he believed he had lined up the funds from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to take Tesla private after eight years as a publicly held company. He defended his initial August 2018 tweet as well-intentioned and aimed at ensuring all Tesla investors knew the automaker might be on its way to ending its run as a publicly held company. 'I had no ill motive,' Musk testified. 'My intent was to do the right thing for all shareholders.' Spiro echoed that theme in his closing argument. 'He was trying to include the retail shareholder, the mom and pop, the little guy, and not seize more power for himself,"" Spiro said. Porritt, meanwhile, scoffed at the notion that Musk could have concluded he had a firm commitment after a 45-minute meeting at a Tesla factory on July 31, 2018, with Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia's wealth fund, given there was no written documentation. In his 90 minute presentation, Spiro emphasized Musk's track record helping to start and run a list of companies that include digital payment pioneer PayPal and rocket ship maker SpaceX, in addition to Tesla. The automaker based in Austin, Texas, is now worth nearly $600 billion, despite a steep decline in its stock price last year amid concerns that Musk's purchase of Twitter would distract him from Tesla. Recalling Musk's roots as a South African immigrant who came to Silicon Valley to create revolutionary tech companies, Spiro described his client 'as the kind of person who believes the impossible is possible.""

The automaker based in Austin, Texas, is now worth nearly $600 billion, despite a steep decline in its stock price last year amid concerns that Musk's purchase of Twitter would distract him from Tesla.Recalling Musk's roots as a South African immigrant who came to Silicon Valley to create revolutionary tech companies, Spiro described his client 'as the kind of person who believes the impossible is possible.'Porritt put a different twist on Musk's mindset during his presentation. 'To Elon Musk, if he believes it, or just thinks about it, it's true.'In his concluding remarks, Porritt told jurors their decision will boil down to their answer to one question: 'Do the rules apply to everyone, or can Elon Musk do whatever he wants and not face the consequences?'Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

'To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred,' Tesla said in the filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker cautioned that if the government decides to pursue an enforcement action, it could possibly have a material adverse impact on its business. Messages were left Tuesday seeking comment from the Justice Department and from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. Tesla Inc. is already facing multiple investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for problems with its two driver-assist systems, Autopilot and 'Full Self-Driving.' Despite their names, Tesla still says on its website that the cars can't drive themselves. Teslas using 'Full Self-Driving' can navigate roads in many cases, but experts say the system can make mistakes, which even CEO Elon Musk acknowledges. 'We're not saying it's quite ready to have no one behind the wheel,' CEO Musk said in October. Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the Justice Department could be looking at safety issues with the systems, or it could be investigating Tesla claims that the cars can drive themselves when they can't. 'When you get the car, it really can't do everything that's been promised,' Brooks said. 'Tesla is putting a vehicle out on the road that is unable to perform to the capabilities claimed. Yet we have drivers relying on those promises and esentially not paying attention to the drive because they think it is more capable than it is.' The systems have been under investigation by NHTSA since June of 2016 when a driver using Autopilot was killed after his Tesla went under a tractor-trailer crossing its path in Florida. A separate probe into Teslas that were using Autopilot when they crashed into emergency vehicles started in August 2021. At least 14 Teslas that have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot system. Including the Florida crash, NHTSA has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes in which automated systems are suspected of being used. Nineteen people have died in those crashes, including two motorcyclists. The agency also is investigating complaints that Teslas can brake suddenly for no reason. 'Full Self-Driving' went on sale late in 2015, and Musk has used the name ever since. It currently costs $15,000 to activate the system. Tsl In 2019 he promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020, and he said in early 2022 that the cars would be autonomous that year. Since 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing 'Full Self-Driving' using owners who haven't been trained on the system but are actively monitored by the company. Tesla said this month that 400,000 owners are participating. Auto safety advocates and government investigators have long criticized Tesla's monitoring system as inadequate. Three years ago the National Transportation Safety Board listed poor monitoring as a contributing factor in a 2018 fatal Tesla crash in California. The board recommended a better system, but said Tesla has not responded. NHTSA has noted in documents that numerous Tesla crashes have occurred in which drivers had their hands on the wheel but still weren't paying attention. The agency has said that Autopilot is being used in areas where its capabilities are limited and that many drivers aren't taking action to avoid crashes despite warnings from the vehicle. In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board determined in 2020 that Tesla's system to make sure drivers are paying attention is not adequate, and it should be limited to areas where it can safely operate.

The billionaire abandoned the take-private plan about two weeks after his initial tweets.It's an especially poignant vindication for Mr Musk after his August 2018 tweets got him and Tesla sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and he reluctantly agreed to accept restrictions on his social media posts.The outcome marked another victory for the billionaire's go-to lawyer, Alex Spiro, in a risky trial that many high-profile executives would have avoided by reaching an out-of-court settlement.In 2019, Mr Spiro persuaded a federal jury in Los Angeles to return a verdict for Mr Musk in less than an hour in a defamation case brought by a British caver whom Musk called a 'pedo guy while they were exchanging insults on Twitter.'The jury got it right, Mr Spiro said after the verdict, declining further comment. – Agencies",irishtimes.com,798,world,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/0UA-Wa9jS-3qQNsB1IDh1n09RAs=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/IC7KQQNSEBUD6ALUZS4EZA2TAU.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,7.2791376,25719689f4b1ee8fd2694213f6623650

187,How Much Does The Tesla Model X Cost In 2023?,Michael Akuchie,2023-01-31 00:00:14,date,https://screenrant.com/tesla-model-x-cost-2023/,screenrant.com,"Pricing begins from $109,990.","The Tesla Model X is an electric SUV and the company's high-end offering, but how much does it cost in 2023? The Model X is arguably one of the longest-running electric models in the automotive industry, though its influence has waned thanks to the entry of rivals like the Rivian R1S and BMW iX. What makes the competitors enticing is that they are more affordable and boast attractive features. However, Tesla is better placed in the EV game, with a robust public charging network its biggest advantage in the space. The Model X is an attractive option for many but has a hefty price tag. Over the years, EV demand increased, and as expected, Tesla raised the price for its entire lineup. However, the manufacturer has announced a series of price cuts that not only place its products at a friendlier price point, but some even qualify for the clean vehicle tax credit. Following recent deductions, the Tesla Model X now starts at $109,990 for the Dual-Motor AWD variant, while the Tri-Motor AWD option (Plaid) will cost buyers $119,990. Both editions previously retailed for $120,990 and $138,990, respectively. Current orders for the Tri-Motor version will be delivered between February and March, while the deliveries of the Dual-Motor type will be between March and June. Is The Model X Still Worth Buying In 2023? The electric SUV has led its segment since deliveries of the Model X started in 2015. But with much more competition, should anyone still consider buying it in 2023? The short answer is yes. The Model X still has a lot going for it and has only improved over the years. It is one of the few EVs offering a range of more than 300 miles. The base dual-motor trim can be driven for up to 348 miles on a single charge, though certain factors like elevated driving speed or extreme temperatures may reduce the range. The trim features a top speed of 149 mph and a 0 to 60 mph record of 3.8 seconds. But buyers can increase the top speed to 155 mph by getting the 22"" Turbine Wheels for $5,500. However, there will be a slight dip in the range, rated for 330 miles with the wheel upgrade. Meanwhile, the Tri-Motor Model X offers faster acceleration (0 to 60 mph in 2.5 secs), but at the expense of range (331 miles). The top speed remains 149 mph, but users can bump the speed to 163 mph with the Turbine Wheels. Of course, this will also lower the range to 311 miles. The tri-motor model is considered the 'quickest accelerating SUV in production today,"" adding perks like torque vectoring, 1,020 horsepower, high thermal capability brake pads, and more. Buyers can get a traditional steering wheel or Tesla's famous yoke-style wheel. The base trim has a seating layout for 5 to 7 occupants, while the Plaid variant is designed for 6 persons only. Regarding color options, both variants come in the standard Pearl White Multi-Coat. Tesla charges between $1,500 and $2,500 for other colors: Solid Black, Midnight Silver Metallic, Deep Blue Metallic, and Red Multi-Coat. Enhanced Autopilot ($6,000) and Full Self Driving ($15,000) are available for driving assistance and safety features. Despite its flaws, FSD is now used by nearly 400,000 vehicles in North America. Model X purchases don't include home charging equipment, so the Wall Connector ($425) and Mobile Connector ($230) will have to be bought separately. The Model X remains a great choice despite growing competition. It offers premium features, impressive range, acceleration, and so much more, making it worth the Tesla Model X's asking price.

Musk, the CEO of both Tesla and Twitter, strode into the San Francisco federal courtroom moments before closing arguments from the opposing attorney in the case were scheduled to begin and took a seat alongside his legal team. Like everyone else in the courtroom, he was wearing a mask, as required by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, but briefly dropped it as he chuckled and whispered something to one of his lawyers. Although an August 7, 2018 tweet disclosing he had 'funding secured "" is the at the center of the trial, Musk wasn't required to show up for Friday's proceedings. His presence in court while he is trying to reverse huge losses at Twitter and overseeing Tesla amid stiffening competition underscores the importance of the trial's outcome to him. If the nine-person jury decides to hold him liable for misleading Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period in August 2018 for the funding secured tweet and a follow-up tweet indicating a deal was imminent, Musk and Tesla could be on the hook for billions in damages. Those 2018 tweets already have cost Musk and Tesla $40 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations of misconduct. Chen had decided last year that Musk's 2018 tweets were false and has instructed the jury to view them that way. During roughly eight hours on the stand, Musk insisted he believed he had lined up the funds from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to take Tesla private after eight years as a publicly held company. He defended his initial August 2018 tweet as a well-intentioned communication to ensure all Tesla investors knew the automaker might be on its way to ending its then-eight-year run as a publicly held company. 'I had no ill motive,' Musk testified. 'My intent was to do the right thing for all shareholders.' The jury is expected to begin its deliberations in the afternoon after the closing arguments are finished.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

189,"Tesla investors lost $12 billion after Musk tweet, jury is told",,2023-02-01 00:00:00,date,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/02/01/tesla-investors-lost-12-billion-after-musk-tweet-jury-is-told/,irishtimes.com,Musk claims his 'funding secured' tweet was truthful,"Tesla investors lost $12 billion over 10 days as a result of Elon Musk's famous tweet in 2018 that he had 'funding secured to take the company private, a witness testified at a trial over the CEO's liability.Lawyers for Musk have said there are billions of dollars in damages at stake in the trial, now in its third week in San Francisco federal court. Testimony presented to jurors on Tuesday by expert witnesses for the plaintiffs was aimed at showing that Musk's August 2018 Twitter posts sent Tesla's stock on a roller coaster ride that hurt investors who held a variety of positions, long and short.The loss figure was presented to the jury by Michael Hartzmark of Forensic Economics, who testified about how he measured the impact of Musk's tweets on the prices of Tesla securities. The $12 billion estimate applies to all Tesla investors, which is a larger group than those who are part of the class-action lawsuit.Hartzmark didn't offer a bottom-line number for how much the plaintiffs are seeking in damages, but he told the jury that Musk's tweets did 'consequential harm to investors and laid out his methodology for calculating losses.It was clear the information Musk conveyed was 'material, or important to reasonable investors, as shown by the questions and concerns communicated in emails to the company's investor relations office at the time,' Hartzmark said.He walked jurors through how Tesla's share price spiked in response to the initial announcement from Musk — and then declined sharply as doubts grew about the take-private plan, in part fueled by public knowledge that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the tweets.'Uncertainty is the kryptonite of investors,' Hartzmark said. 'As this went drip, drip, drip over time it would have a negative impact on the share price.'Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Musk, got Hartzmark to reluctantly acknowledge on cross examination that the first part of Musk's tweet, that he's 'considering' taking Tesla private, was true. The judge handling the case has previously determined that the second piece of Musk's tweet, that he had 'funding secured,' was false.Rossman asked whether Hartzmark examined the effect of the truthful part of the tweet on Tesla's stock price separately from the element that has been ruled false.'It's an interwoven bundle,' Hartzmark replied. He evaluated them together, he said, because Musk had previously indicated he'd like to take Tesla private and that fact was reflected in Tesla's stock price before the CEO's tweet. The only new information in the 10-day period covered by the lawsuit was Musk's assertion that he had 'funding secured,' he said.Earlier the jurors heard from Steven Heston, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland. Another expert witness for the investors, Heston shared his research about what happened to Tesla options from August 7, 2018, when Musk posted his tweets, over 10 days, as the proposed plan to take the company private fell apart. He noted an 'abrupt movement in options prices over the period and an 'unprecedented pattern in the volatility of long-term options prices.Heston showed the jurors how a short-term call option expiring one month after Musk's tweet, at a strike price of $420 – the share price at which Musk said Tesla would go private – rose almost $2. A long-term call at the same stock price but expiring January 17, 2020, lost $22.40.Musk has testified that the 'funding secured' tweet was 'absolutely truthful,' touting what he described as an 'unequivocal commitment' by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund to back the go-private plan with billions of dollars — even though he had nothing in writing.Investors argue Musk's tweets amounted to a violation of securities laws because his bankers had been barely consulted and hadn't formally signed on to his take-private plan. Investment banking witnesses told jurors last week that even a week after the tweet, they were still working to figure out how the deal would be structured, including who would pay for it.US District Judge Edward Chen said as court adjourned for the day that he expects the case will go to the jury by Friday. -- Bloomberg",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/lCeEMrzATuTR-Y0-m50j34bxbtE=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/XEOTZHXGRFVQT54G5YYL5TSL34.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.9920177,32dca30315c3f04fcb922de6986f90f6
190,Tesla hikes price of Model Y after US alters tax credit rule,Associated Press,2023-02-04 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-online/2023/02/04/tesla-hikes-price-of-model-y-after-us-alters-tax-credit-rule,ny1.com,"Tesla has raised prices on its Model Y in the U.S., apparently due to rising demand and changes in U.S. government rules that make more versions of the small SUV eligible for tax credits","DETROIT (AP) — Tesla has raised prices on its Model Y in the U.S., apparently due to rising demand and changes in U.S. government rules that make more versions of the small SUV eligible for tax credits. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle company bumped up the price of the Model Y Long Range version by about 2% to $54,990 and the Performance version by about 2.7% to $57,990, according to its website. The prices exclude shipping and an order fee. The moves, made Friday, come three weeks after Tesla cut prices nearly 20% on some versions of the Model Y, the company's top-selling vehicle. The price cuts were made to boost sagging demand, and also to make more versions of the Model Y eligible for the $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. The full tax credits will be available at least into March. On Friday, The Treasury Department revised vehicle classification definitions to make more EVs — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible the full $7,500. The change came after lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum credit. Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with top aides to President Joe Biden last week to discuss the EV industry and the broader goals of electrification. Under the sweeping law approved last summer, pickup trucks, SUVs and vans with a sticker price up to $80,000 qualify for EV tax credits, while new electric cars, sedans and wagons can only be priced up to $55,000. The rule had disqualified some higher-priced SUVs, such as GM's Cadillac Lyriq and some versions of the Model Y, prompting complaints from Tesla and other automakers. The January price cuts apparently worked. On Tesla's earnings conference call last week, CEO Elon Musk said that so far in January the company had seen the strongest number of orders year-to-date in company history. He also said the company had raised the Model Y price 'a little bit in response to that.' After Tesla's price cuts, Ford responded by reducing the price of its Mustang Mach-E, in part to qualify for the tax credit and also to spur buyer interest. But crosstown rival General Motors said it had no plans to cut EV prices. The EV tax credits are among a host of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress approved in August with only Democratic votes. The law is designed to spur EV sales as part of a broader effort to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. But a complex web of requirements, including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify, has cast doubt on whether buyers can receive the full $7,500 credit. The Treasury Department said Friday that it hopes to make it easier for consumers to know which vehicles qualify for the credit. Under the revised rule, vehicle classifications will be determined by a consumer-facing fuel economy labeling standard, rather than a more complicated formula set by the Environmental Protection Agency, Treasury said. A message was left Saturday seeking comment from Tesla on the price increases. The increases were reported Friday night by Bloomberg News.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Purpose: Accurate detection of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) on susceptibility-weighted (SWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for the characterization of many neurological diseases. Low-field MRI offers greater access at lower costs and lower infrastructural requirements, but also reduced susceptibility artifacts. We therefore evaluated the diagnostic performance for the detection of CMBs of a whole-body low-field MRI in a prospective cohort of suspected stroke patients compared to an established 1.5 T MRI. Methods: A prospective scanner comparison was performed including 27 patients, of whom 3 patients were excluded because the time interval was >1 h between acquisition of the 1.5 T and 0.55 T MRI. All SWI sequences were assessed for the presence, number, and localization of CMBs by two neuroradiologists and additionally underwent a Likert rating with respect to image impression, resolution, noise, contrast, and diagnostic quality. Results: A total of 24 patients with a mean age of 74 years were included (11 female). Both readers detected the same number and localization of microbleeds in all 24 datasets (sensitivity and specificity 100%; interreader reliability ϰ = 1), with CMBs only being observed in 12 patients. Likert ratings of the sequences at both field strengths regarding overall image quality and diagnostic quality did not reveal significant differences between the 0.55 T and 1.5 T sequences (p = 0.942; p = 0.672). For resolution and contrast, the 0.55 T sequences were even significantly superior (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0003), whereas the 1.5 T sequences were significantly superior (p < 0.0001) regarding noise. Conclusion: Low-field MRI at 0.55 T may have similar accuracy as 1.5 T scanners for the detection of microbleeds and thus may have great potential as a resource-efficient alternative in the near future.
 




 
Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small (2–10 mm diameter), round, or ovoid hypointense foci with associated blooming with enhanced visibility on MRI sequences sensitive to susceptibility artifacts [1,2]. They can be observed in patients with cognitive complaints and stroke but also in healthy individuals. Technically, local magnetic field inhomogeneities caused by paramagnetic iron in CMBs result in signal loss on MRI sequences, such as T2*-weighted gradient echo sequences or susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). SWI is derived from gradient echo sequences with additional post-processing to improve contrast resolution and is usually acquired in three dimensions to increase spatial resolution with flow compensation in all three planes to reduce artifacts. SWI has increased sensitivity and reliability for CMBs compared with T2*-weighted gradient echo but requires a longer acquisition time [3]. Further, technical aspects such as a low flip angle, long echo time, and long repetition time increase the sensitivity to susceptibility effects [2]. Moreover, the susceptibility effect and signal-to-noise ratio have been described to increase with higher magnetic field strength [4].On the other hand, MRI accessibility is low and extremely inhomogeneous around the world, because MRI installations require expensive infrastructure (e.g., site preparation to host the large magnets, magnetic/radiofrequency shielding, and emergency helium exhaust conduit), high maintenance costs (i.e., for helium refill), have high operational costs for specialized radiographic technicians, and require huge amounts of electricity and water leaving a large ecological footprint [5,6]. Thus, the distribution of MRI scanners is concentrated mainly within high-income countries, and ~70% of the world's population has little to no access to MRI (OECD (2022), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units (indicator); DOI: 10.1787/1a72e7d1-en). Moreover, even in high-income countries, clinical MRI scanners are mostly located in highly specialized radiology departments, large and centralized imaging centers, and housed on the ground floors of hospitals and clinics, excluding easy access to neurology clinics, trauma centers, surgical suites, neonatal/pediatric centers, and community clinics [5]. With this in mind, low-field MRI is increasingly coming into focus, offering MR imaging at a much lower cost, offering a considerable energy-saving potential but also reducing possible complications with metallic implants. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of a 0.55 T low-field MRI in a prospective cohort of suspected stroke patients and to directly compare the diagnostic value for the detection of CMBs to a standard 1.5 T MRI.This prospective study was reviewed and approved by the cantonal (Basel-Stadt, Switzerland) ethics committee (BASEC2021-00166). All included patients signed an informed consent form.Data acquisition was performed from 1 May 2021 to 30 June 2021 at the Division of Neuroradiology, Clinic of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. All patients who presented to the emergency room with suspected ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and who underwent MRI using a 1.5 T scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Avanto FIT 1.5 T; Siemens Healthineers; Erlangen, Germany) as part of the diagnostic stroke workup were included. Immediately afterwards, patients were examined using a 0.55 T scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM FreeMax 0.55 T; Siemens Healthineers; Erlangen, Germany). The 1.5 T scanning protocol was in accordance with the hospital's internal standard protocol for emergency stroked diagnostics including SWI sequences (Table 1). The 0.55 T SWI protocol was adapted to the 1.5 T SWI protocol as far as technically possible (same slice thickness (ST) and slice spacing (SP); comparable in-plane resolution) to ensure the most objective scanner comparison. After subsequent verification with respect to data completeness (scan protocols with complete image acquisition) and image quality (artifacts, image contrast), the datasets were transferred to the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS; General Electric (GE); Waukesha, WI, USA) for further analysis.Data analysis was performed in a two-step procedure: First, the 0.55 T and 1.5 T SWI datasets were evaluated using Likert rating. Second, a reading study was performed regarding identification, localization, and number of CMBs.Likert rating was performed by a neuroradiologist and a neuroradiologist in training with an experience of 9 and 5 years. Each acquired 0.55 T or 1.5 T SWI dataset was rated with respect to the following criteria with a numerical value between 1 and 10 (1 worst, 10 best):(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)Sample SWI sequences from a 3 T scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra 3 T; Siemens Healthineers; Erlangen, Germany) were set as the gold standard (numerical value = 10). Dataset assessment was PACS-based using a standardized bookmark. Both readers were blinded to the results of the other reader.Reading of 0.55 T and 1.5 T datasets was performed PACS-based and blinded (no clinical information, no image information) by two neuroradiologists with 8 and 13 years of professional experience. PACS-based post-processing as part of image analysis was allowed. For each dataset, number of SWI lesions (0, 1, 2–10, >10) and SWI lesion localization were analyzed.The final neuroradiological report was defined as the underlying gold standard for the accuracy of the reading study.For statistical evaluation of Likert rating, a mean of the ratings of Readers 1 and 2 was first calculated for each 0.55 T and 1.5 T patient dataset and evaluation points (a)–(e). Subsequently, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate significant or non-significant differences in Likert rating between the 0.55 T and 1.5 T sequences. Then interreader comparisons were performed to determine intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Calculation of sensitivity and specificity of Readers 1 and 2 in the reading study was performed in relation to the gold standard.A total of 27 patients with complete and artifact-free datasets were prospectively included in this study, of whom 3 patients were excluded because the time interval between the 1.5 T scan and 0.55 T scan was >1 h. The mean age of the remaining 24 patients was 74 years (standard deviation 14 years), and 11 patients were female (46%). The mean time interval between the 1.5 T scans and 0.55 T scans was 36 ± 14 min. Baseline characteristics of the patient cohort are presented in Table 2.Both readers detected the same number and localization of microbleeds in all 24 0.55 T and 1.5 T datasets (sensitivity and specificity 100%; interreader reliability ϰ = 1). Ten 1.5 T datasets did not contain any microbleeds by analysis of the more experienced neuroradiologist and were therefore defined as the control group. No false-positive findings were observed by assessment of these images by Reader 2 (positive predictive value and negative predictive value 100%).Likert ratings of the sequences with both field strengths regarding overall image quality (a) and diagnostic quality (e) did not reveal significant differences between the 0.55 T and 1.5 T sequences (p = 0.942 and p = 0.672, respectively; see Figure 1). Regarding the subjective evaluation of the spatial resolution (b) and contrast (d), the 0.55 T sequences were rated to be significantly superior: (b) p < 0.0001; (d) p < 0.0003. In contrast, the 1.5 T sequences were superior (p < 0.0001) regarding noise (c). Interreader comparisons showed moderate to high levels of agreement between Reader 1 and Reader 2 for the Likert ratings (ICC: (a) 0.91; (b) 0.93; (c) 0.60; (d) 0.87; (e) 0.88).Our study shows that detection of microbleeds in SWI MRI sequences at a field strength of 0.55 T is possible with the same specificity and sensitivity compared to conventional 1.5 T MRI (for sample sequences, see Figure 2). Moreover, Likert ratings for the subjective evaluation of spatial resolution and contrast resolution were not significantly different for both 0.55 T and 1.5 T sequences, whereas for SWI noise, 0.55 T sequences were even superior.To the best of our knowledge, no comparable study has performed a 0.55 T versus 1.5 T scanner comparison regarding the detection of microbleeds before. In a previous study, we showed that low-field MRI is not inferior to scanners with higher field strength for the detection of small infarcts in DWI and FLAIR sequences; however, in this study, there were minor limitations in the detection of very small infarcts [7]. Another group evaluated the performance of a modern 0.55 T MRI in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms in comparison to the gold standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA) [8]. This study included a total of 19 aneurysms in 16 patients, which were identified in both 0.55 T magnetic resonance angiography and DSA. Moreover, measurements of the two readers showed no significant differences between 0.55 T TOF MRA and DSA in the overall aneurysm size (calculated as the mean from height/width/neck), as well as in the mean width and neck values. The mean height was significantly larger in 0.55 T TOF MRA in comparison to DSA, whereas intermodality (1.5 T and 3 T TOF MRA) and interrater agreement were excellent (ICC > 0.94). Thus, the authors concluded that TOF MRA acquired with a modern 0.55 T MRI is a reliable tool for the detection and initial assessment of intracranial aneurysms. Moreover, in another study, we showed that patients perceived 0.55 T new-generation low-field MRI to be more comfortable than conventional 1.5 T MRI, given its larger bore opening and reduced noise levels during image acquisition, and concluded that new concepts regarding bore design and noise level reduction of MR scanner systems may help to reduce patient anxiety and improve well-being when undergoing MR imaging [9]. For microbleeds, the diagnostic accuracy of SWI sequences of the 0.55 T Magnetom FreeMax in our study seemed to be even higher, offering great potential for the characterization of associated diseases such as diffuse axonal injury or cerebral amyloid angiopathies [8].In principle, the use of low-field MRI in clinical routine has several advantages. First, accessibility is low and extremely inhomogeneous around the world because MRI installations require expensive infrastructure, so the distribution of MRI scanners is concentrated mainly within high-income countries, and ~70% of the world's population has little to no access to MRI [5]. Moreover, even in high-income countries, clinical MRI scanners are mostly located in highly specialized radiology departments, large and centralized imaging centers, and in those are housed on the ground floors of hospitals [5]. In a recent analysis by our group, we could show that in terms of purchase price, the savings potential of a 0.55 T MRI compared to a 1.5 T MRI system is about 40–50% [10]. The 25% lower weight of the system additionally reduces the transportation costs incurred, and the smaller size of the unit allows for installation by a remotely controlled mobile robotic system without opening the exterior façade, if the operating site is at ground level. Together with the lack of need to install a quench pipe, this reduces the total cost of installation by up to 70%. The maintenance cost of a 0.55 T MRI is approximately 45% less than that of a 1.5 T unit with a comparable service contract. Further cost reductions result from the smaller room size and potentially lower energy consumption for examinations and cooling. In conclusion, the use of lower-field-strength MRI systems offers enormous economic and environmental potential for both hospitals and practice operators, as well as for the healthcare system as a whole.

Tesla increased the price of the Model Y Long Range to $54,990, and the Model Y Performance to $57,990, an increase of $1,000 each, according to current and previous prices posted on its website. It was the second increase in price for the Model Y Long Range over the past two weeks. The models remain 15% and 17% cheaper, respectively, than they were before Tesla slashed prices last month to stoke demand, before accounting for the $7,500 tax credit buyers now qualify to receive. In a reversal, the Treasury Department ruled on Friday that crossovers like the Model Y would qualify for electric vehicle tax credits as long as they were priced below $80,000. The ceiling for cars, sedans and wagons is lower at $55,000. That represented a win for Tesla, General Motors, Ford and other automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to loosen the vehicle definitions in the implementation of the incentive plan to make more of their lineups eligible. At its previous price, a Tesla buyer of a Model Y would only have been able to add about $1,000 in extra features, such as a tow hitch, before pushing the price above the level at which the tax incentive would apply.

194,"After Tesla price cut, Ford follows suit with Mustang Mach-E",Associated Press,2023-01-30 00:00:00,date,https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/ap-online/2023/01/30/ford-cuts-price-on-mustang-mach-e-after-tesla-price-cuts,baynews9.com,"Ford is cutting prices on its Mustang Mach-E electric SUV by as much as $6,000 just weeks after market leader Tesla made similar moves","DETROIT (AP) — Ford is cutting prices on its Mustang Mach-E electric SUV by as much as $6,000 just weeks after market leader Tesla took similar steps. The Detroit automaker is increasing production of the Mach-E this year and said it is taking advantage of streamlined costs to reduce prices across the board, it said Monday. The cut comes just over two weeks after Tesla Inc. dropped prices 6% to nearly 20% in the United States on most of its models in an effort to bolster demand and raise market share. Ford's maneuver will almost certainly force other automakers to trim prices as well, touching off a bit of a price war for electric vehicles, said Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, a Detroit-area consulting firm. 'To remain price competitive to consumers, it's going to require a response from anyone who wants to play in this area,' he said. However, Schuster says he doesn't see an all-out price war that brings prices down even more. Automakers will try to protect profit margins on EVs as their share of the U.S. market keeps growing, he said. Although Ford didn't mention Tesla in its statement, the Dearborn, Michigan, company said the price cuts are part of Ford's plan to keep the SUV competitive in a fast-changing market. 'We are not going to cede ground to anyone,' said Marin Gjaja, Chief Customer Officer of Ford Model e, the company's electric vehicle unit. The price of a base rear-wheel-drive standard range Mach-E will drop $900, from $46,895 to $45,995. The top-end GT extended range will fall $5,900, from $69,895 to $63,995. The prices don't include shipping, government fees or taxes. On Jan. 13, Tesla Inc. slashed prices dramatically on several versions of its electric vehicles, making some of its models eligible for a new federal tax credit that could help spur buyer interest. The company dropped prices nearly 20% in the United States on some versions of the Model Y SUV, its top seller. That cut will make more versions of the Model Y eligible for a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit, which will be available through March. Tesla also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive model, by about 6%. The cuts were in response to slowing demand and Tesla's sagging stock price. But CEO Elon Musk predicted they would yield stronger sales, with the company delivering 1.8 million vehicles this year, up 40% from 2022. Ford said its price cuts are designed to make the Mach-E a more compelling option for EV customers, and to grow the company's EV market share. Nissan, which has two EVs competing in the mainstream U.S. market, the Ariya and Leaf, said it has no plans to change prices, at least not now. 'Of course we're watching what's going on,' said Brian Brockman, vice president of communications. General Motors' Chevrolet brand, which will have four EV model lines on sale by the end of this year, said it had no pricing announcements coming. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from Hyundai and Kia, two other large competitors in the mainstream EV market. The auto industry is seeing the cost of many raw materials decline, and that will help companies to trim prices, Schuster said. Shipping costs for parts also have dropped, he said. The price cuts touched off by Tesla are different from the way the auto industry used to try to stimulate sales — keeping the price the same but offering discounts, Schuster said. The cuts, he said, are generating headlines and will get customers in the door to look. They also are likely to last longer than spot discounts, he said. 'You're not likely to see the price increase in a month, or two months, or six months, at least before the next model year' in late summer, Schuster said.

Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Dharmesh Patel, the Tesla driver whose car plunged off a 250-foot cliff with his wife and kids inside, has been charged with three counts of attempted murder, court records show. San Mateo County district attorney Steve Wagstaffe said during Patel's arraignment on Monday that his office was charging the driver with attempted murder after reviewing videos from the incident, as well as statements from Patel's wife and witnesses at the scene, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The district attorney said Patel's wife made ""incriminating"" statements about her husband and witnesses at the scene did not see brake lights before the car plunged off the cliff, the Chronicle reported. The prosecutors have also enhanced the charges with allegations of domestic violence, as well as causing ""great bodily injury,"" according to court records. ""We do believe the evidence establishes the necessary intent to kill,"" Wagstaffe said at the arraignment, per the San Francisco Chronicle. During Patel's arraignment, he was behind a pane of glass that was not visible to the court room and only communicated with his attorney, Joshua Bentley, the news outlet said. His attorney requested a delay for the next court meeting till February  9, which was granted by the judge, court records show. The attorney told the judge he's ""not certain"" Patel will be able to make it to a microphone due to ""serious lower body injuries,"" per the San Francisco Chronicle's report. The attorney said he was released from the hospital and moved to jail without bail on Friday and Waggstaffe said his wife was still in the hospital, per the San Francisco Chronicle. The judge had granted the request for no bail due to the ""potential danger to family members,"" the publication said. Earlier this month, Patel, his two children, and wife survived a 250-foot dive off a cliff known as Devil's Slide. The San Mateo County Sheriff's Office said in a tweet on January 2 that the children were ""unharmed"" at the time of rescue. NBC reported that the adults were taken to the hospital in critical condition upon recovery, but were later found to have sustained non-life-threatening injuries.  At the time of the incident, the family's survival was hailed as ""nothing short of a miracle."" But, California Highway Patrol later said that ""Based on the evidence collected, investigators developed probable cause to believe this incident was an intentional act."" Wagstaffe said investigators are looking to rule out any issues with the car that could have caused the accident, but have yet to find any issues, The Los Angeles Times reported. The authorities had previously said that Tesla's driver assist features, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving do ""not appear to be a contributing factor in this incident.""

197,Tesla board directors testify Elon Musk's 2018 ‘funding secured' tweet consistent with deal talks,Alexis Keenan,2023-02-02 00:00:41,date,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-board-directors-testify-elon-musks-2018-funding-secured-tweet-consistent-with-deal-talks-000041997.html,yahoo.com,Tesla (TSLA) board members testified on Wednesday that Elon Musk's 2018 Twitter posts about taking the electric-vehicle company private were consistent with what he related to the board about a…,"Tesla (TSLA) board members testified on Wednesday that Elon Musk's 2018 Twitter posts about taking the electric-vehicle company private were consistent with what he related to the board about a potential take-private deal.
Outside director James Murdoch, son of film and television titan Rupert Murdoch, took the stand among other former or current board members.
The testimony is part of the class-action trial brought by company shareholders who contend they traded Tesla shares to their detriment based on the tweets. They claim Musk and directors are liable to pay billions of dollars in damages.
On Aug. 7, 2018, Musk posted to the social media site that he had 'funding secured' to take Tesla private. While the deal never materialized, Musk maintains that at the time he believed — based on a series of meetings with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) — that its authorized representative made an ""unequivocal"" verbal commitment to the transaction.
Murdoch, named as a defendant in the case, told the jury that on Aug. 2, 2018 — five days before Musk's first disputed tweet — Musk emailed the board to communicate an offer to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
Murdoch characterized Musk's email as 'serious' and explained that the board immediately convened a special meeting — absent Musk as the potential bidder — to discuss the deal.
Tesla's then-CEO Deepak Ahuja, Murdoch said, communicated to the board that Musk's vision for the transaction would primarily include funding from Saudi Arabia's Sovereign Wealth Fund and potentially include investments from existing Tesla shareholders who could choose to roll their public investments into private shares.
'I found that to be novel…and perhaps difficult,' Murdoch said, adding that he later hosted Musk for a get-together at his home where the two ""talked about those dynamics.'
The following day on Aug. 3, 2018, Murdoch said the board met again, this time with Musk included. He testified that Musk and Ahuja expressed that funding was abundant and that a clear level of intent had been expressed by the PIF.
'Did it surprise you that Musk expressed confidence in funding via the Saudi PIF?' Musk's lawyer asked Murdoch, based on his own financial dealings with Middle Eastern investment funds.
'No,' Murdoch replied.
Former Tesla director Linda Johnson Rice, also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, told the jurors that she, too, recalled Ahuja's presentation to the board concerning the PIF's interest in taking Tesla private.
'My understanding was Musk had discussed this transaction with the PIF,' Johnson Rice said about the Aug. 2 meeting, 'and they were interested and very sincere in wanting to fund the transaction.'
Current Tesla director Ira Ehrenpreis testified that during the Aug. 2 and Aug. 3 meetings, Ahuja and Musk respectively told the board that the PIF alone could fund the entire transaction and that Musk's tweets were consistent with his email to the board. Regardless of Saudi funding, however, Ehernpries added that Musk had 'more than enough interest' from investors and that the PIF was not likely Musk's only avenue to privatize Tesla.
Ehernpreis admitted on cross examination that he was not aware of any commitment for particular financing, or for a price for funding that would be needed to take Tesla private at the time of Musk's posts.
Musk's brother, an outside Tesla director, also named in the lawsuit, testified that he purposely didn't attend the board's initial meeting due to his family relationship creating a conflict of interest. On cross examination, he admitted that he asked his brother to be more thoughtful in his use of Twitter.
Other Tesla directors named in the lawsuit include former board members Brad Buss and Antonio Gracias, and current member Robyn Denholm.
The shareholders are tasked with proving that, at the time of the tweets, Musk knew the information within them was false and material — information that a reasonable investor would rely on in making investment decisions. They must also prove that the information caused them to buy or sell Tesla shares to their detriment.
Before trial, Senior District Court Judge Edward Chen, who is presiding over the case, ruled that Musk's funding statement was untrue.
The defense on Wednesday rested its case. Closing arguments are slated for Friday, after which the case's nine-member jury is expected to begin deliberations.

Courtesy of Prerak Patel Just five days after it was delivered, a brand new Tesla Model Y's steering wheel fell off, its owner says. Prerak Patel was driving down a highway near Woodbridge Mall in New Jersey with his wife and kids when the incident occurred. ""I was driving a normal speed in the left lane when all of the sudden I had this loose wheel in my hand,"" Patel told Insider. ""By the grace of God, there was nobody behind me. I took my foot off the pedal, and I was able to pull all the way over to a divider.""  Patel said it took 10 to 20 minutes for the police to arrive at the scene and that the car was later towed to a nearby Tesla service center. Pictures of the steering wheel appear to show the wheel entirely detached from the steering column, only hanging on by exposed wires. Patel posted several photos from the incident on Twitter. —Prerak & Neha Patel (@preneh24) January 30, 2023 Patel has yet to pick up his car from the service center, but he said he was told by a service representative that a bolt was missing from the steering column. He'd always wanted to buy a Tesla, he said, and saw an opportunity when the company lowered its prices for its Model Y and Model 3 on January 13. He ordered the car the same day the price cuts were announced. Now, he's not sure he wants to drive the car again, feeling that he'd be putting his family at risk. ""If they give me that same car back, I won't feel comfortable driving it, "" Patel said. ""I've asked for a refund. I've asked for a new car.""

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. It's not the first time that a Tesla owner has complained of issues with the car's steering wheels. In 2020, Tesla driver Jason Tuatara posted photos of a Model 3 steering wheel that had fallen off.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, SUVs can cost up to $80,000 to qualify for EV tax credits. But cars, sedans and wagons must cost less than $55,000. Previously, EVs like the Tesla's Model Y, GM's Cadillac Lyriq, Ford's Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen's ID.4 didn't qualify for EV credits because they fell short of the Treasury Department's weight requirement under its definition of an SUV. But on Friday, Treasury broadened its definition of SUV, allowing more models from Tesla and other carmakers to qualify for EV tax credits that can reach up to $7,500 per car. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had criticized the Treasury's prior standards, which allowed some cars that were not fully electric to qualify while some fully electric cars did not. Meanwhile, Tesla sold 55,796 vehicles in China in January, according to data published Friday by the China Passenger Car Association. That's up 18% from December and 10% from a year ago. The spike comes as Tesla slashed that price of cars in China last month by 6% to 13.5% on certain models. Tesla sales also remained strong despite the lunar new year holiday slowing consumer activity. After slowing production in December, the company plans to boost output at its Shanghai plant in the next two months as the price cuts spur more demand, sources told Reuters.

200,Tesla's pickup truck is coming soon – maybe,Jack Ewing,2023-02-07 00:00:00,date,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/business/teslas-cybertruck-pickup-stainless-steel.html,nytimes.com,"More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month…","More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla's share price, but it also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Musk's hubris.
It would be very unlike Musk, Tesla's CEO, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup – three of the bestselling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck's doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla's first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla's most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Musk's penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to 'production hell' and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it's the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck's body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn't need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the 'Back to the Future' films.
'Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech startups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions,' Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. 'To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk.'
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel's tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
'Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don't have to learn from anyone else,' said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, 'and then they get stuck in a corner.'
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn't begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle 'will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line' in 2023, Musk said, 'but it will be next year.'Tesla's delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or SUVs.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the bestselling vehicle, because it can't make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
GM's GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
'The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away,' Rajkumar said. 'It's a massive opportunity lost.'
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact. The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
'Broadly the concept could make sense,' said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. 'This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good.'
'But there are some open questions,' Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck's body, which Tesla refers to as an 'exoskeleton.' Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape. If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are 'certainly possible,' said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. 'I can understand why he wants to go there.'

The agency said in an investigative report released Wednesday on the fiery April 17, 2021 crash in the Houston suburb of Spring that the 59-year-old Tesla driver apparently moved to the back seat after slamming into the car's front air bag, deforming the steering wheel in the crash.
Although the crash raised questions about whether the car was operating on Tesla's 'Autopilot' partially automated driving system, the NTSB determined that the system could not have been used on the street where the crash happened due to lack of lane lines. Testing showed the car's 'Traffic Aware Cruise Control' system could have been used, although it would only work up to the maximum speed on the suburban road, 30 mph, the report said.
The 2019 Tesla reached 67 mph two seconds before hitting the second of two trees at 57 mph before being consumed by flames as the lithium-ion battery caught fire.
The Tesla's event data recorder showed that the accelerator moved 'consistent with driver activity' in the five seconds before the crash, and that the driver's seat belt was connected when the crash happened.
'Although the driver's seat was found vacant and the driver was found in the left rear seat, the available evidence suggests that the driver was seated in the driver's seat at the time of the crash and moved into the rear seat postcrash,' the report said.
The agency found that excessive speed and failure to control the car due to alcohol impairment caused the crash. The report says testing by a Federal Aviation Administration lab found that the driver had a blood-alcohol level of 0.151 grams per deciliter, almost twice the Texas legal limit of 0.08. Two over-the-counter sedating antihistamine medications also were found in the driver's blood, according to the report.
Autopsies determined that the driver died from blunt force trauma, burns and smoke inhalation. The 69-year-old male passenger died from blunt force trauma to the torso and extremities, as well as burns, the report said.
The agency said security video from the driver's home showed the driver and passenger getting into the front seats before driving away from the home. The car traveled about 550 feet before leaving the road on a curve, hitting a storm sewer inlet and raised manhole, sideswiping one tree before hitting another, the agency said.

The report says testing by a Federal Aviation Administration lab found that the driver had a blood-alcohol level of 0.151 grams per deciliter, almost twice the Texas legal limit of 0.08. Two over-the-counter sedating antihistamine medications also were found in the driver's blood, according to the report.
Autopsies determined that the driver died from blunt force trauma, burns and smoke inhalation. The 69-year-old male passenger died from blunt force trauma to the torso and extremities, as well as burns, the report said.
The agency said security video from the driver's home showed the driver and passenger getting into the front seats before driving away from the home. The car traveled about 550 feet before leaving the road on a curve, hitting a storm sewer inlet and raised manhole, sideswiping one tree before hitting another, the agency said.

The agency said in an investigative report released Wednesday on the fiery April 17, 2021 crash in the Houston suburb of Spring that the 59-year-old Tesla driver apparently moved to the back seat after slamming into the car's front air bag, deforming the steering wheel in the crash.
Although the crash raised questions about whether the car was operating on Tesla's 'Autopilot' partially automated driving system, the NTSB determined that the system could not have been used on the street where the crash happened due to lack of lane lines. Testing showed the car's 'Traffic Aware Cruise Control' system could have been used, although it would only work up to the maximum speed on the suburban road, 30 mph, the report said.
The 2019 Tesla reached 67 mph two seconds before hitting the second of two trees at 57 mph before being consumed by flames as the lithium-ion battery caught fire.
The Tesla's event data recorder showed that the accelerator moved 'consistent with driver activity' in the five seconds before the crash, and that the driver's seat belt was connected when the crash happened.

 will present a third version of 
Elon Musk
's 'master plan' next month, almost a full year after the chief executive officer said he was working on a next edition.
 
The electric-car maker will outline 'the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth' during its March 1 investor day, Musk tweeted. Tesla has already said its expansion plans and next-generation platform for cheaper vehicles will be on the agenda.

Musk first published a master plan for Tesla in 2006, outlining ambitions to build a high-performance 
sports car
 and use proceeds from that product to gradually build more affordable 
electric vehicles
. Ten years later, he authored 'part deux,' which detailed ambitions to build solar roofs, expand into all major auto segments and develop self-driving capability.
 
Much of the second master plan remains unfinished business. The rollout of the solar roof was a bust, Tesla has just four vehicles in volume production and its cars aren't autonomous. Tesla's claims about self-driving capabilities — and Musk's role in shaping them — are now subject to investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Tesla shares have soared more than 1,200% since Musk published the second master plan, though the advance was tempered last year by Musk's acquisition of Twitter and lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries. The stock fell 65% in 2022, its first annual decline since 2016.
 
Tesla shares have risen early this year on optimism that steep 
price cuts
 will revive sales growth. Musk said last month the company will aim to produce 2 million cars this year and minimize the affects of price reductions by trimming costs.
 
The carmaker also expects to make some progress in padding out its lineup with the Semi that it started delivering to customers in December, and the 
Cybertruck
 slated to begin limited production later this year.

This paper reports the discovery of a series of computational social media accounts (Fanbots) on Twitter that may have played a critical role in sustaining the entrepreneurial narratives of Tesla, the electric-vehicle maker. From 2010 to 2020—a period of trial, error, and eventual success for Tesla—these computational agents generated pro-firm tweets (Corporate Computational Propaganda, CCP), accounting for more than 10% of the total Twitter activity that included the cashtag, $TSLA, and 23% of activity that included the hashtag, #TSLA. Though similar to programmed social media content in the political sphere, the activities of these accounts predate the existence of political computational propaganda associated with foreign support for, for instance, Brexit in the United Kingdom (2016) and Donald Trump in the United States (2016). The paper (a) characterizes the extent of Fanbot content in two large Tesla tweet corpora, (b) identifies possible motivations for the creation of these accounts in relation to the firm's entrepreneurial narratives, and (c) explores possible mechanisms by which the Fanbots might have acted. Although we are unable to directly observe the source or stated purpose of these accounts, based upon the timing of Fanbot creation and other indirect indicators, we infer that these accounts and the social media activity they generated were intended to influence social perception of Tesla. The conclusion assesses the generalizability of a Fanbot-based strategy, highlighting contextual limitations, while also pointing to ways that firms may already be using CCP to manage social approval in emerging-industry contexts.

This work presents the design, testing and validation of a pTx/Rx coil for the human neck and cervical/upper-thoracic spinal cord. The pTx portion is composed of 8 dipoles to ensure high homogeneity over this large region of the spinal cord. The Rx portion is made of 20 semi-adaptable overlapping loops to produce high Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across the patient population. The coil housing is designed to facilitate patient positioning and comfort, while being tight fitting to ensure high sensitivity. We demonstrate RF shimming capabilities to optimize B1+ uniformity, power efficiency and/or specific absorption rate (SAR) efficiency. B1+ homogeneity, SNR and g-factor was evaluated in adult volunteers and demonstrated excellent performance from the occipital lobe down to the T4-T5 level. We compared the proposed coil with two state-of-the-art head and head/neck coils, confirming its superiority in the cervical and upper-thoracic regions of the spinal cord. This coil solution therefore provides a convincing platform for producing the high image quality necessary for clinical and research scanning of the upper spinal cord.

'FSD beta software that allows a vehicle to exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner 
increases
 the risk of a crash,' the agency said Thursday in a letter notifying Tesla of the recall.
The NHTSA found the problem during an investigation into 'Full Self-Driving' and 'Autopilot' software , according to The Associated Press. 
'As required by law and after discussions with NHTSA, Tesla launched a recall to repair those defects,' the agency said.
T​esla produced more than 
1.3 million
 electric vehicles last year, amid a growing EV market that advocates say could help 
cut 
greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate the impacts of human-caused climate change.
T​esla will release a free software update for the recalled vehicles. Owner notification letters should be mailed by April 15.

In a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board, workers are accusing the electric-car maker of unfair labor practices. Tesla alleges that the terminations were part of regular job reviews.
Cathy Creighton
 is director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab and a former field attorney for the NLRB.
Creighton says:
'If the NLRB finds merit to the charge, they can seek an injunction in Federal District Court seeking to reinstate the terminated workers and make them whole. At the same time, the NLRB will proceed with its administrative law process of holding a trial before a judge who will determine whether Tesla has violated the National Labor Relations Act or not.
'The Tesla plant sits on the former site of Buffalo's Republic Steel plant. The wages and benefits that came from those jobs did not materialize out the generosity of the Steel barons, they were fought for over decades by the members of the Steelworkers Union. 
New York state gave Tesla $750 million in public money to build the plant. However, Tesla's workers earn far less than their peers represented by the UAW. New York also didn't require Tesla to abide by federal labor law and allow its workers to form a union and bargain collectively. 
'It is not enough to give billionaires subsidies and hope that they share the wealth with their workforce. New Yorkers should expect that jobs they are subsidizing are jobs that are well paid, with good benefits, where employees can share in their employer's profitability.'

The recall came after U.S. safety regulators expressed concerns about the way Tesla's system responds in four areas along roads.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Thursday on its website that Tesla will fix the concerns with an online software update in the coming weeks.
The documents say Tesla is doing the recall but does not agree with an agency analysis of the problem.
The system, which is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners, makes unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, failing to come to a complete stop at stop signs, or going through an intersection during a yellow traffic light without proper caution, NHTSA said.
In addition, the system may not adequately respond to changes in posted speed limits, or it may not account for the driver's adjustments in speed, the documents said.
'FSD beta software that allows a vehicle to exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner increases the risk of a crash,' the agency said in documents.
The recall covers certain 2016-2023 Model S and Model X vehicles, as well as 2017 through 2013 Model 3s, and 2020l through 2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with the software, or with installation pending.
A message was left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.

The recall, part of part of a larger investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Tesla's automated driving systems, is the most serious action taken yet against the electric vehicle maker.
It raises questions about CEO Elon Musk's claims that he can prove to regulators that cars equipped with 'Full Self-Driving' are safer than humans, and that humans almost never have to touch the controls.
Musk at one point had promised that a fleet of autonomous robotaxis would be in use in 2020. The latest action appears to push that development further into the future.
The safety agency says in 
documents posted on its website Thursday
 that Tesla will fix the concerns with an online software update in the coming weeks. The documents say Tesla is doing the recall but does not agree with an agency analysis of the problem.

'FSD beta software that allows a vehicle to exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner increases the risk of a crash,' the agency said in documents.
Musk complained Thursday on Twitter, which he now owns, that calling an over-the-air software update a recall is 'anachronistic and just flat wrong!' A message was left Thursday seeking further comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.
Tesla has received 18 warranty claims that could be caused by the software from May of 2019 through Sept. 12, 2022, the documents said. But the Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker told the agency it is not aware of any deaths or injuries.
In a statement, NHTSA said it found the problem during tests performed as part of an investigation into Tesla's 'Full Self-Driving' and 'Autopilot' software that take on some driving tasks.
'As required by law and after discussions with NHTSA, Tesla launched a recall to repair those defects,' the agency said.
Despite the names 'Full Self-Driving' and 'Autopilot,' Tesla says on its website that the cars cannot drive themselves and owners must be ready to intervene at all times.
NHTSA's testing found that 'Autosteer on City Streets,' which is part of Tesla's FSD beta testing, 'led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety based on insufficient adherence to traffic safety laws.'
In documents, NHTSA says that on Jan. 25, as part of regular communications with Tesla, it told the automaker about concerns with FSD, and it asked Tesla to do a recall. Both sides met numerous times in the following days, and on Feb. 7, Tesla decided to do the recall out of an abundance of caution, 'while not concurring with the agency's analysis.'
The recall is another in a long list of problems that Tesla has with the U.S. government. In January, the company disclosed that 
the U.S. Justice Department had requested documents
 from Tesla about 'Full Self-Driving' and 'Autopilot.'
NHTSA has been investigating Tesla's automated systems since June of 2016 when a driver using Autopilot was killed after his Tesla went under a tractor-trailer crossing its path in Florida. A separate probe into Teslas that were using Autopilot when they crashed into emergency vehicles started in August 2021. At least 14 Teslas 
that have crashed into emergency vehicles
 while using the Autopilot system.
Including the Florida crash, NHTSA has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes in which automated systems are suspected of being used. Nineteen people have died in those crashes, including two motorcyclists.
The agency also is investigating complaints that 
Teslas can brake suddenly for no reason.
'Full Self-Driving' went on sale late in 2015, and Musk has used the name ever since. It currently costs $15,000 to activate the system.
The recall announced Thursday covers certain 2016-2023 Model S and Model X vehicles, as well as 2017 through 2013 Model 3s, and 2020 through 2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with the software, or with installation pending.
Shares of Tesla fell slightly in Thursday afternoon trading. The stock has rallied about 72% in the year to date, reversing 2022′s hefty loss.

The workers at the Buffalo plant received an email Wednesday evening updating them on a new policy that prohibits them from recording workplace meetings without all participants' permission, the group said in a release Thursday. It said that such restrictions violate federal labor law and flouts New York's one-party consent law to record conversations.
'We're angry. This won't slow us down. This won't stop us,' Sara Costantino, a current Tesla employee and organizing committee member, said in a prepared statement. 'They want us to be scared, but I think they just started a stampede. We can do this. But I believe we will do this.'
The Tesla plant, which makes solar panels and other renewable energy technology, is not far from a Starbucks location where workers voted to unionize last year.
TWU said that the firings were unacceptable and that the expectations placed on Tesla workers are 'unfair, unattainable, ambiguous and ever changing.'
'I feel blindsided, I got COVID and was out of the office, then I had to take a bereavement leave. I returned to work, was told I was exceeding expectations and then Wednesday came along,' organizing committee member Arian Berek, who is one of the fired employees, said in a statement. 'I strongly feel this is in retaliation to the committee announcement, and it's shameful.'
The Rochester Regional Joint Board of Workers United has filed a complaint against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the electric vehicle maker of unfair labor practices.
In the complaint, the group lists the names of several employees who were part of the factory's autopilot department that were fired. The group says that it believes Tesla 'terminated these individuals in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity.' It is asking the NLRB for injunctive relief 'to prevent irreparable destruction of employee rights resulting from Tesla's unlawful conduct.'
As part of union organizing efforts, the Tesla Workers United organizing committee said in a letter to management Tuesday that 
employees are seeking a voice on the job
 at the plant in Buffalo and want to 'build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company.'
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a hard line against organized labor, despite an 
invitation
 to the United Auto Workers union to hold an organizing vote at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. In 2021 Tesla was ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to make Musk delete a 2018 tweet in which it said that he 
unlawfully threatened employees

Since January of 2022, Tesla has issued 20 recalls, including several that were required by NHTSA. The recalls include one from January of last year for 'Full Self-Driving' vehicles being programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds. Others included seat belt chimes that may not sound when vehicles are started and drivers haven't buckled up, heat pumps that don't defrost windshields quickly enough, and cars that make sounds that obscure pedestrian warnings.
'Full Self-Driving' went on sale late in 2015, and Musk has used the name ever since. It currently costs $15,000 to activate the system.

224,Group: Tesla workers fired after launching union efforts,The Associated Press,2023-02-16 00:00:00,date,https://www.wfsb.com/2023/02/16/group-tesla-workers-fired-after-launching-union-efforts/,wfsb.com,"An email was sent to Tesla seeking comment, but it has been widely reported that Tesla has disbanded its media relations team.","(AP) - Several employees at a Tesla factory in New York have been fired a day after launching union organizing efforts, according to Tesla Workers United.
The workers at the Buffalo plant received an email Wednesday evening updating them on a new policy that prohibits them from recording workplace meetings without all participants' permission, the group said in a release Thursday. It said that such restrictions violate federal labor law and flouts New York's one-party consent law to record conversations.
'We're angry. This won't slow us down. This won't stop us,' Sara Costantino, a current Tesla employee and organizing committee member, said in a prepared statement. 'They want us to be scared, but I think they just started a stampede. We can do this. But I believe we will do this.'
The Tesla plant, which makes solar panels and other renewable energy technology, is not far from a Starbucks location where workers voted to unionize last year.
TWU said that the firings were unacceptable and that the expectations placed on Tesla workers are 'unfair, unattainable, ambiguous and ever changing.'
'I feel blindsided, I got COVID and was out of the office, then I had to take a bereavement leave. I returned to work, was told I was exceeding expectations and then Wednesday came along,' organizing committee member Arian Berek, who is one of the fired employees, said in a statement. 'I strongly feel this is in retaliation to the committee announcement, and it's shameful.'
The Rochester Regional Joint Board of Workers United has filed a complaint against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the electric vehicle maker of unfair labor practices.
In the complaint, the group lists the names of several employees who were part of the factory's autopilot department that were fired. The group says that it believes Tesla 'terminated these individuals in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity.' It is asking the NLRB for injunctive relief 'to prevent irreparable destruction of employee rights resulting from Tesla's unlawful conduct.'
As part of union organizing efforts, the Tesla Workers United organizing committee said in a letter to management Tuesday that 
employees are seeking a voice on the job
 at the plant in Buffalo and want to 'build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company.'
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a hard line against organized labor, despite an 
invitation
 to the United Auto Workers union to hold an organizing vote at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. In 2021 Tesla was ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to make Musk delete a 2018 tweet in which it said that he 
unlawfully threatened employees
 with loss of stock options if they chose to be represented by the UAW.
An email was sent to Tesla seeking comment, but it has been widely reported that Tesla has disbanded its media relations team. The email sent to Tesla bounced back as undeliverable.

Tesla
 shares extended their breakneck rally last Thursday to double from the lows touched in early January, helped by a rising appetite for growth and technology stocks, and signs that demand for its 
electric vehicles
 is rebounding.
 
The shares closed up 3% at $207.32 in New York, capping a 104% gain from their Jan. 6 intraday trough. The shares are bouncing off a 65% plunge in 2022. 
 
Riskier growth stocks, which were beaten down hard last year amid concerns about rising interest rates and a recession, have made a strong comeback in 2023 as optimism about the economy has returned and investors bet the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike cycle is nearing its end. At the same time, Tesla's own earnings last month, and a spate of positive headlines on tax credits for electric vehicles, have provided further lift to the shares of the Elon Musk-led company. 
 
'Tesla is rising so fast because of a market that believes the Fed is coming to the rescue,' said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm Patriarch Organization. Good fourth-quarter results and 'price cuts to turbocharge demand' also helped, he said.
 
Early in February, the Biden administration said it will expand the newly-revamped electric vehicle tax credit to allow SUVs costing up to $80,000 to receive those credits. That move is a positive for Tesla, analysts said. Separately, the company has seen a surge in demand for its cars after January's big price cut, allowing it to institute a slight price hike. 
 
Still, Tesla's gains of 68% this year far outpace those of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which is up 13%, as well as that of the NYSE FANG+ Index, which has advanced 28% in 2023. A frenzy of speculative 
trading in
 recent weeks that has seen retail traders rush into some of their favorite stocks can explain some of that exuberance, given Tesla's popularity among individual shareholders.  
 
'Tesla has definitely been the main target of retail buying so far this year,' said Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda Securities. While retail investors buying the stock is not unusual, given Tesla is 'an ultimate retail favorite,' Iachini said the persistence and magnitude of the flows are surprising.
 
Given that Tesla's sharp decline over the past year brought significant pain to mom-and-pop traders, the recent 'hunger' for the stock could be due to a desire to chase it higher and make up for losses, Iachini said. Just this week, Tesla alone attracted a 33% share of overall net purchases across all US securities, according to Vanda. 
 
The heavy retail flows into the stock are coming ahead of the company's investor day on March 1, where Musk is expected to unveil a third version of his 'master plan,' Vanda analysts noted.  
 
Despite January's gravity-defying rally, the EV-maker's shares are still down 49% from the all-time high of $409.97 touched in early November 2021. And while some investors say that the worst could be over for Tesla, others advocate caution, especially with the risk of a recession still hovering and the EV industry's brisk pace of growth expected to slow in the near-term. Meanwhile, skepticism about the company's newest model, the Semi 
heavy-duty truck
, are continuing to linger.
 
The stock is now trading just above the average analyst price target tracked by Bloomberg — suggesting Wall Street doesn't see much more upside. Meanwhile, Tesla's relative strength index, a technical gauge that measures whether a stock is under or over bought — shows signs of excessive buying, typically seen by markets as an indication that a decline is imminent.
 
Tesla shares can continue to rise until the end of the first quarter or early second quarter, 'when signs of a potential hard landing may again slash valuation,' Patriarch's Schiffer said.

227,White House: Tesla to make some EV chargers available to all,Associated Press,2023-02-15 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/02/15/tesla-supercharger-network-open-agreement/,autoblog.com,"New proposed rule would open up Tesla's charging network to owners of other brands' EVs, allowing the CA automaker to qualify for more EV credits.","WASHINGTON — Electric car giant 
Tesla
 will, for the first time, make some of its charging stations available to all U.S. 
electric vehicles
 by the end of next year, under a new plan announced Wednesday by the White House.
 
The plan will make at least 7,500 
chargers
 from Tesla's Supercharger and Destination 
Charger
 network available to non-Tesla EVs by the end of 2024, the White House said.
 
The plan to open the nation's largest and most reliable charging network to all drivers is a potential game-changer in promoting EV use, a key component of 
President Joe Biden's
 goal to fight 
climate change
.
 
""As 
President Biden said, the great American road trip will be electrified,'
 ' said Mitch Landrieu, a White House aide who oversees implementation of the 
2021 infrastructure law signed by Biden.
 
Soon, charging an EV ""will be as easy as filling up at a 
gas station
,'' Landrieu said.
 
The plan to open up Tesla's charging network was among a series of developments announced Wednesday by the White House, such as new standards to make EV charging networks convenient and reliable for all Americans, including those driving long distances. The new standards will ensure that everyone can use a charging network, no matter what car they drive or what state they charge in, Landrieu and other officials said.
 
Tesla, 
General Motors
, EVgo, 
Pilot
, Hertz and other companies also have agreed to expand their networks by thousands of public charging ports in the next two years, using private funds and federal spending from the infrastructure law, ""putting the nation's EV charging goals even closer within reach,'' the White House said.
 
""It's clear this administration is making incredible progress in ensuring EVs' future,'' Landrieu told reporters Tuesday.
 
Under the administration's plan, Tesla will set up charging sites at hotels, restaurants and other public spaces in urban and rural locations, the White House said. All EV drivers will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or website, officials said. Tesla plans to triple its nationwide network of Superchargers over the next few years, the White House said.
 
The developments come after 
Landrieu and another top White House aide, John Podesta, met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Washington
 last month. Biden did not attend the meeting, which centered on the EV industry and the broader goal of electrification of the U.S. economy, the White House said.
 
A week later, 
the Treasury Department said it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500
 under 
new vehicle
 classification definitions. The revised standards follow lobbying by Tesla and other automakers to change vehicle definitions to allow higher-priced EVs to qualify for a maximum tax credit.
 
Tesla raised prices on its Model Y SUV
 within hours of the Treasury announcement.
 
Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for Guidehouse 
Insight
, said the agreement to open up Tesla chargers to non-Tesla EVs ""is potentially a very big deal.''
 
The plan ""should be a big help to non-Tesla EV drivers if they can use the Tesla network and if the network remains as reliable as it is today,'' he said.
 
While the White House said the Tesla network should be available through use of a company app or website, an adaptor — or even a new charger design — will likely be required for non-Tesla EVs, Abuelsamid said.

In 
a statement
, Tesla said the terminations were the result of poor ratings on performance reviews that were conducted before the union campaign was announced. The list of employees being dismissed was finalized Feb. 3, and Tesla became aware of organizing activities Feb. 13, the company said.


'We learned in hindsight that one out of the 27 impacted employees officially identified as part of the union campaign,' Tesla said. 'This exercise pre-dated any union campaign.'


TWU said that the firings were unacceptable and that the expectations placed on Tesla workers are 'unfair, unattainable, ambiguous and ever changing.'

Tesla raised prices on its Model Y SUV
 within hours of the Treasury announcement.
Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for Guidehouse Insight, said the agreement to open up Tesla chargers to non-Tesla EVs 'is potentially a very big deal.''
The plan 'should be a big help to non-Tesla EV drivers if they can use the Tesla network and if the network remains as reliable as it is today,'' he said.
While the White House said the Tesla network should be available through use of a company app or website, an adaptor — or even a new charger design — will likely be required for non-Tesla EVs, Abuelsamid said.

236,Ousted Tesla cofounder Martin Eberhard sounds off in wide-ranging interview,Insider,2023-02-18 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/02/18/tesla-cofounder-martin-eberhard-interview-elon-musk/,autoblog.com,"While Elon Musk is sometimes referred to as the founder of Tesla, Martin Eberhard cofounded Tesla in 2003 with his friend Marc Tarpenning.","Martin Eberhard chatted about 
electric cars

While Elon Musk is sometimes referred to as the founder of Tesla, his part in the carmaker's history is more complicated.
 
Martin Eberhard cofounded Tesla in 2003 with his longtime friend Marc Tarpenning. Musk led the company's $7.5 million Series A funding round and became chairman of the board in 2004.
 
But Eberhard and Musk butted heads, and Musk ousted Eberhard from his CEO role in 2007. Musk said that Eberhard was holding up production of Tesla's first car, the Roadster, and that Eberhard was responsible for 
other operational issues
.
 
Musk, who took over as CEO in 2008, has called Eberhard the 
worst person he's ever worked with
. Eberhard sued Musk in 2009, accusing him of libel and defamation. (The two men later 
settled the lawsuit
.)
 
I spoke over video call in December with Eberhard, who was once called ""Mr. Tesla"" and now describes himself as a ""retired entrepreneur."" The Tesla cofounder discussed everything from his startup's early days to the future of electric cars.
 
Tesla regrets
 
Eberhard said that there are a million things he would've done differently at Tesla knowing what he knows now but that they're mostly small regrets.
 
For example, he said Tesla spent too much time debating whether to sell its cars through 
dealerships
 or directly to customers. He also said that while he would have made technical changes to the Roadster, overall he's proud of what the team created.
 
""If you have hindsight, you can see all the mistakes you made,"" he said. ""But I think in the large strokes, we got it right. And the proof is for the first time ever in decades we built a car company successfully.
 
""Would I take his money if I could do it over again?"" he asked, referring to Musk's investment. ""I didn't see a lot of other money on the table, you know.""

Eberhard said that had he stayed, he would've made some different choices than Musk.
 
""For example, I would have very much opposed the acquisition of SolarCity,"" he said, calling it ""a distraction"" for Tesla.
 
Tesla 
acquired SolarCity
, a solar-energy company, in 2016 for $2.6 billion. Musk came under scrutiny because the company was run by his cousin Lyndon Rive, who was facing headwinds running the business. Some Tesla shareholders filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of putting pressure on Tesla's board members to buy SolarCity and bail it out; Musk 
won the lawsuit
 last year. In 2021, Tesla's energy-generation-and-storage segment generated 
nearly $3 billion in revenue
.
 
Eberhard also said he would've worked to create a more positive culture at Tesla had he remained at the company. ""I'm a believer of treating employees with respect, and 
I'm not into random firings and things like that
,"" he said. ""So maybe the culture inside the company would have been a little bit nicer.""
 
Eberhard appeared to be alluding to reports suggesting that Musk can be a difficult person to work for, prone to 
acting out of anger
 and even 
rage-firing employees
. Musk has denied such allegations and said in 2021 that he gave 
""clear and frank"" feedback
 to employees.
 
Musk did not respond to several requests from Insider for comment on this story. Emails to Tesla's press line were not returned.
 
Describing his own management style, Eberhard said: ""I tried to keep the company motivated by keeping them on mission to realize that what we're doing was really important for the world. And that motivated people to put lots and lots of hard hours into it — but not out of fear, rather out of that feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of responsibility.
 
""We didn't do random firings,"" he added. ""I did have to fire some people from time to time, but I hated it.""
 
What Musk was like at work
 
Eberhard said that in recent years he's tried to avoid news about Musk.
 
""Honestly, I have Elon Musk blocked in my news feed,"" he said. ""I don't need to read any more about him. It just gives me indigestion to read that. What happens is that Musk will make some wild-ass claim on Twitter and suddenly a bunch of reporters want to talk to me. That's how I hear about it.""
 
But Eberhard did say he'd noticed a change: He described Musk as much more hands-on with his companies than he was at Tesla during Eberhard's tenure.
 
 
 
 Eberhard said Musk was less hands-on at Tesla in the company's early years.

""Elon is a different person now than he was then,"" Eberhard said. ""He was no more involved than any other board member. He came to board meetings. He did not have an office at the company. He didn't come there regularly. He did not give direction to my employees, anything like that. He was a board member.""
 
Now, Eberhard added, Musk is ""a super-active kind of guy."" He pointed to 
the layoffs at Twitter
 in November shortly after Musk took over that company.
 
Tesla's early history is a point of contention between Musk and Eberhard. In a 
tweet in November
, Musk said he ""was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster."" Eberhard pushed back on that characterization.
 
Eberhard said that while he was the CEO and Musk was the chairman of the board, Musk came to board meetings monthly but didn't regularly work at the company. ""So, you know, the idea of him, like, sitting around working on the car or something is simply not true,"" Eberhard said. ""He was not there.""
 
Eberhard said he realized friction was growing between him and Musk when Tesla started getting more media attention.
 
""His behavior changed dramatically as soon as we started having press about Tesla,"" Eberhard said. ""He got mad if anything was ever written about Tesla and it didn't feature his name prominently. And that's when I realized that there was an ego involved here that I hadn't recognized before.""
 
Eberhard, who at the time had the nickname ""Mr. Tesla,"" said that anytime Musk wasn't mentioned in an article about the company, Musk would 
call him and ""scream"" at him
.
 
Musk ousted Eberhard in 2007 and became CEO shortly after. But that wasn't the end of their contact.
 
 
 
 Eberhard said he sent Musk a congratulatory note in 2008 when SpaceX sent its first rocket to space. 
Steve Nesius/Reuters
 
 
 
Eberhard 
filed a defamation lawsuit against Musk
 in 2009, after Musk started calling himself a Tesla founder and made negative comments about Eberhard. The lawsuit was 
settled the same year
 for an undisclosed amount, with the condition that Musk and two other Tesla executives, JB Straubel and Ian Wright, could also claim the title of Tesla founder. Musk and Eberhard also signed a nondisparagement agreement.
 
Eberhard said that was the last time he spoke with Musk. He added that he'd sent Musk a congratulatory message in 2008 when Musk sent his first rocket into space but that he never received a reply.
 
Musk has occasionally 
tweeted
 about Eberhard. Eberhard said that while he's not sure why, he has a theory.
 
""My guess is because he tried for years to set the narrative that he was the founder and people know that's not true now. It's under his skin,"" Eberhard said. ""What my therapist told me is that 'what you can read from all that is you're still under his skin, so if he's under yours at least you're even.'
 
""Like I said, I'm relatively powerless, and there's not much I can do. I just take it.""
 
How the EV market has evolved
 
Eberhard said that when he and Tarpenning founded Tesla in 2003, everybody knew it was ""impossible"" to turn a profit by making 
electric vehicles
. Tesla was the only startup trying after legacy automakers like 
Ford
 had 
largely given up
 on electric cars.
 
The International Energy Agency has 
estimated that 13% of automobiles sold globally in 2022
 were electric. ""I see it as we won, basically,"" Eberhard said. ""The revolution that we set out to start — we succeeded.""
 
Eberhard said he had one piece of advice for startups and legacy automakers alike joining the EV industry: ""
Don't try to compete head-on with Tesla
.""
 
 
 
 Eberhard said the automotive industry isn't a ""winner-take-all industry."" 
Getty
 
 
 
""Unlike so many Silicon Valley companies, the auto industry is not a winner-take-all industry,"" he said. ""There's different kinds of cars for different market segments.""
 
The Tesla cofounder said he was disappointed by certain companies, like 
Lucid
. He said Lucid is trying to compete directly against the 
Model S
 with a similar electric sedan, the 
Lucid Air
. (Eberhard said he worked for the company when it was still known as Atieva in 2015 but was ""not a big fan"" of its CEO and left after six weeks.)
 
Lucid confirmed that Eberhard worked at the company for a short period in 2015 but declined to comment on his departure. A representative for the startup pushed back on Eberhard's characterization of the Lucid Air, calling it a ""new benchmark for EV 
sports sedans
.""
 
Eberhard said he was more impressed by companies like 
Rivian
. ""Rivian has looked out there and said, 'You know, the No. 1-selling vehicle in North America is the 
F-150
 truck. So if we want to find a new market, that's a lucrative place to work,'"" Eberhard said.
 
While Tesla dominates the US EV market, Ford has taken the No. 2 spot. Ford sold 
just over 41,000 EVs
 in the first three quarters of 2022, while Tesla 
delivered over 900,000
 in the same period.
 
Eberhard said that Tesla has been waiting for other companies to catch up but that he doesn't see companies like Ford as a threat. ""The world has supported more than a dozen successful large car companies for generations,"" Eberhard said. ""I don't see that changing.""
 
Tesla's Autopilot and the rise of auto tech
 
Eberhard might not think Tesla is threatened by other automakers, but he said he sees a greater threat coming from within the company: self-driving technology.
 
""In my opinion, we need to get out of the habit of thinking about all of this autonomous stuff as being connected to EVs,"" Eberhard said, adding, ""I'd like to see people thinking about making cars that people can drive.""
 
Musk has made self-driving technology a key part of Tesla's future. Last year he described the carmaker's self-driving software as the difference between 
Tesla being worth a lot of money or almost nothing
. Musk has said the company ""is as much a 
software company as it is a hardware company
."" But Eberhard says it's not that simple.
 
 
 
 Eberhard said he isn't a fan of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. 
Tim Levin/Insider
 
 
 
""I think it's a mistake to think of a car as a software platform — you know, like an iPhone or something. It's not the same,"" he said.
 
""I have an iPhone, and every time I get a software update there's bugs in there,"" Eberhard added. ""These bugs mean, for example, that occasionally my news-feed app crashes. That's not a big deal, because it's just an annoyance on iPhone. But that kind of a bug shows up in the software that controls, for example, my 
brakes
 or the steering, it can kill you.""
 
Eberhard said that while he appreciated ""safety-oriented systems"" like driver-assist features, he's ""not a big fan"" of autonomous driving. He said Musk appeared to be preoccupied with 
autonomous cars
, and he described that as one of his biggest concerns for Tesla under Musk's leadership.
 
""I think the technology is way too immature to be laying on the road,"" he said, referring to Tesla's Full Self-Driving beta software. ""I mean, this is my cautious nature, but I would have had a really hard time releasing software that is as buggy as that onto the roads.""
 
Musk has said in the past that some bugs are 
to be expected
 with beta software and has 
encouraged
 drivers to report issues with the software.
 
For years Musk has been 
promising
 that Tesla will soon have fully autonomous cars on the road. And while the automaker equips new Teslas with its Autopilot driver-assist program and sells its Full Self-Driving beta feature for $15,000 or for $200 a month, the company is far from achieving fully autonomous driving. Its software requires a licensed operator to monitor the vehicle at all times.
 
The company is also facing scrutiny from several regulators over the technology. The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
 is investigating Tesla's 
Autopilot software
 and its 
Full Self-Driving add-on
. Last month, Tesla disclosed an investigation by the Department of Justice into its self-driving claims. And the Securities and Exchange Commission is 
investigating whether
 Tesla made misleading statements about its software's capabilities.
 
Eberhard said that when he was Tesla's CEO, none of that ""Autopilot crap"" existed. ""I didn't have the budget to do a decent infotainment system in the car, let alone contemplate something like Autopilot,"" he said.
 
Life after Tesla
 
It wasn't easy after Eberhard left Tesla. He said he was ""basically unemployable"" for two years because of an intellectual-property agreement with Tesla, which he said left him largely out of money and work until the agreement expired.
 
""Pretty much on the day that time period expired, 
Volkswagen
 hired me,"" Eberhard said.
 
He joined VW in the fall of 2009 as the director of EV development at the carmaker's Electronics  Laboratory. He left in 2011. He said that trying to make EVs happen at the company was ""a lot like pushing strings.""
 
""I think they got tired of me, and I left,"" he said.
 
He went on to work briefly with several other startups, including Lucid and SF Motors, and he 
launched
 two EV-battery startups, Inevit and Tiveni.
 
Even as he's bounced around, Eberhard hasn't strayed far from his Tesla roots. He said he still drives his Roadster every day, while his wife drives a Model S.
 
 
 
 Eberhard said he owns the second 
Tesla Roadster
 ever produced.

He said that in 2008 he bought the second Roadster ever produced but that he stopped driving it about six or seven years ago, though he occasionally takes it to 
car shows
; the custom-painted car has a vanity plate that says ""Mr. Tesla."" Now he drives a used Roadster.
 
Eberhard said he's maintained a ""small stake"" in Tesla. Though he declined to comment on the size, he said he's kept his stake longer than anyone — he got it two minutes before Tarpenning got his stake. Eberhard owned 
less than 5%
 of Tesla's stock when he left in 2007.
 
""I had a larger stake, and I sold a bunch of my stock early, which, you know, in hindsight was maybe not the ideal thing to do, but that's what I did,"" he said.
 
Today, Eberhard and Tarpenning work together on a small private investment firm. They meet for coffee every Wednesday — something they've been doing since 1988.
 
""If one of us is out of town that week we move it to a Tuesday or Thursday, or sometimes it turns into lunch — but yes, even through COVID times we did virtual coffee,"" he said. ""It was over such coffee where we dreamed up 
Nuvomedia, the rocket book
, and it's also where we dreamed up Tesla.""

WASHINGTON — Electric car giant Tesla will, for the first time, make some of its charging stations available to all  electric vehicles by the end of next year, under a new plan announced Wednesday by the White House.
 
The plan will make at least 7,500 chargers from Tesla's Supercharger and Destination Charger network available to non-Tesla EVs by the end of 2024, the White House said.
 
The plan to open the nation's largest and most reliable charging network to all drivers is a potential game-changer in promoting EV use, a key component of President Joe Biden's goal to fight climate change. Biden has set a goal that 50% of new  car sales be electric by 2030, and he has pledged to install 500,000 chargers across America and build a network of fast-charging stations across 53,000 miles of freeways from coast to coast.
 
""As President Biden said, the great American road trip will be electrified,' ' said Mitch Landrieu, a White House aide who oversees implementation of the 2021 infrastructure law signed by Biden.
 
Soon, charging an EV ""will be as easy as filling up at a gas station,'' Landrieu told reporters Tuesday.
 
The plan to open up Tesla's charging network was among a series of developments announced Wednesday by the White House, such as new standards to make EV charging networks convenient and reliable for all Americans, including those driving long distances. The new standards will ensure that everyone can use a charging network, no matter what car they drive or what state they charge in, Landrieu and other officials said.
 
""No matter what EV you drive, we want to make sure that you will be able to plug in, know the price you're going to be paying and charge up in a predictable, user-friendly experience,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.
 
New standards imposed by the Transportation Department require that EV chargers funded through the infrastructure law be built in the United States, effective immediately. By July 2024, 55% of the cost of all components must come from the 
 
Automakers warned before the rules were issued that imposing made-in-America requirements on EV components could harm EV growth.
 
Tesla, General Motors, EVgo, Pilot, Hertz and other companies have agreed to expand their charging networks by thousands of public charging ports in the next two years, using private funds and federal spending from the infrastructure law, ""putting the nation's EV charging goals even closer within reach,'' the White House said.
 
""It's clear this administration is making incredible progress in ensuring EVs' future,'' Landrieu said.
 
Under the administration's plan, Tesla will set up charging sites at hotels, restaurants and other public spaces in urban and rural locations, the White House said. All EV drivers will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or website, officials said. Tesla plans to triple its nationwide network of Superchargers over the next few years, the White House said.
 
The developments come after Landrieu and another top White House aide, John Podesta, met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Washington last month. Biden did not attend the meeting, which centered on the EV industry and the broader goal of electrification of the  economy, the White House said.
 
A week later, the Treasury Department said it is making more electric vehicles — including SUVs made by Tesla, Ford and General Motors — eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions. The revised standards follow lobbying by Tesla and other automakers to change vehicle definitions to allow higher-priced EVs to qualify for a maximum tax credit.
 
Tesla raised prices on its Model Y SUV within hours of the Treasury announcement.
 
Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for Guidehouse Insight, said the agreement to open up Tesla chargers to non-Tesla EVs ""is potentially a very big deal.''
 
The plan ""should be a big help to non-Tesla EV drivers if they can use the Tesla network and if the network remains as reliable as it is today,'' he said. A lack of high-quality public chargers on  roads has slowed the growth of EV sales and is often cited by potential buyers as a leading obstacle to purchase of an EV.
 
While the White House said the Tesla network should be available through use of a company app or website, an adaptor — or even a new charger design — will likely be required for non-Tesla EVs, Abuelsamid said.
 
Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner, said the agreement with Tesla was important on its own, but also as a sign of relative peace between Musk and the Biden administration. Musk has repeatedly clashed with Biden and other Democrats, and as the new owner of Twitter, Musk has released a slew of company information showing internal debates among Twitter employees over a decision to block a story about Hunter Biden, the president's son.
 
""It's not good for the  government to alienate the top seller of EVs,'' Ramsey said in an interview.
 
The Biden administration ""needs Musk's help to grow EV use"" in the United States, he added, and the new agreement ""is a sign the government is working with the world's most important EV maker.''",stripes.com,3181,news,US,en,,https://www.stripes.com/incoming/14y3pe-ap23045861289293.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP23045861289293.jpg,False,@starsandstripes,6.922359,f7eca1b9734e79697177373a394a13a5

Sales of Tesla vehicles peak right after its rivals air their Super Bowl ads extolling the virtues of electric cars, even though Tesla never advertises on its own. At Sunday's Super Bowl, however, longtime Tesla critic Dan O'Dowd will be launching the first attack ad against Tesla's self-driving claims.
E-Mobility






After the last Super Bowl halftime electric vehicle advertising onslaught, Tesla saw the sales of its EVs peak dramatically even though there wasn't a single Tesla ad aired as the company only does direct marketing. On Valentine's Day 2022, Tesla orders almost doubled compared to the previous day when the 
Super Bowl ad space was littered with EV advertising
 by BMW, VW, GM, KIA, and others. General Motors aired ad with a title ""Why not an EV,"" for instance, while some like Polestar's ""No compromises"" spot indirectly attacked Elon Musk's Mars landing ambition as unnecessary distraction.


At the 2023 Super Bowl Sunday, however, Tesla attack ads will be much more direct as the first one dedicated entirely to presenting Elon Musk's EV maker in a negative light, will be aired and paid by one of its most fiercest critics, 
Dan O'Dowd from Dawn Project
 fame. He has been known to 
pay influencers to badmouth Tesla's self-driving features online
, and recently created a crash test trying to demonstrate that Tesla's Full Self-Driving Beta kit has a bling spot for small children.


The Tesla attack ad that will air during the Super Bowl festivities will reportedly feature a Model 3 running over child mannequins and hitting strollers, as well as passing stopped school buses or ignoring Do Not Enter street signs. After the last FSD Beta child crash controversy, 
Tesla owners started staging tests with their own children to prove the opposite and YouTube was forced to take them down
 for violating its community guidelines. It would be interesting to follow if the first direct Tesla attack ad will have an impact on any potential post-Super Bowl sales bump.

Elon Musk has been under intense scrutiny since his takeover of Twitter — but things appear to be on the up at Tesla, where he is also CEO.
 
On Wednesday, Musk received rare praise from President Joe Biden after Tesla agreed to open at least 7,500 of its charging stations to other 
electric vehicles
 by the end of 2024. Tesla's 
chargers
 have only been accessible to the brand's cars.
 
""In building our EV charging network, we have to ensure that as many chargers work for as many drivers as possible,"" Biden 
tweeted
 Wednesday, adding: ""To that end, 
@elonmusk
 will open a big part of 
@Tesla
's network up to all drivers. That's a big deal, and it'll make a big difference.""
 
Within seven hours, Biden's tweet had been viewed about 10 million times and garnered over 14,000 likes.
 
 —President Biden (@POTUS) 
February 15, 2023
 
 
In response, 
Musk thanked Biden.
 
 —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 
February 15, 2023
 
 
The cordial exchange between the two is unusual because they previously appeared to have a strained relationship, even 
trading barbs
 openly.
 
Most recently, Musk — 
displeased that Biden's Super Bowl tweet got more engagement than his own
 — asked Twitter engineers to boost his tweets, per a report 
published by Platformer on Wednesday
. 
 
Tensions between the two had become apparent back in August 2021 when 
Musk complained
 on Twitter that 
Tesla wasn't invited to an EV summit
 at the White House even though the automaker 
dominates the US market.
 
Musk has also repeatedly attacked some of Biden's key political agendas including a 
Democratic Party
 tax plan targeting US billionaires. 
Musk said at the time
 that any reallocation of wealth would be better managed by the private sector than by the government. 
 
Biden also hit out at Musk. The president 
aimed a pointed barb
 at the SpaceX CEO's fixation with space in June 2022 — the same time he was touting 
Ford's
 investment into EVs.
 
In November,
 Biden said at a 
White House press conference
 that Musk's ties with foreign countries were ""worthy of being looked at"" following his acquisition of Twitter. White House officials had 
earlier denied
 
reports
 that it was planning a security review of Musk's deals — including the purchase of Twitter.
 
Tumultuous time for Musk and Twitter
 
According to 
Tesla employees
 who are working out of Twitter's office, Musk appears to be ""obviously stressed,"" 
Insider's Kali Hays
 reported earlier on Thursday. They compared the situation now to 2018 — a period Musk referred to as ""excruciating"" and ""the most difficult and painful"" of his entire career — saying it's ""worse."" 
 
Since 
acquiring Twitter
 for $44 billion in late October, Musk has instituted 
sweeping changes
 at the company, including mass layoffs and 
ending some benefits
 to cut costs. 
Advertising also dropped
 amid scrutiny on Twitter — more than half of its top 1,000 
advertisers
 in September were not spending on the platform in the first weeks of 2023, 
CNN
 reported on Monday.
 
Tesla, meanwhile, is faring a tad better — its 
 share prices
 have rebounded this year and are up nearly 74% so far. They had tanked by over 50% in 2022 due to 
various factors,
 including slow demand and vehicle output, the Fed's rate hikes, and Musk's Twitter takeover — which sparked investor concerns that he was spreading himself too thin.
 
The upswing in stock prices has even sent 
Musk's net worth
 soaring. Tesla also beat Wall Street expectations for its 
fourth-quarter earnings
 and analysts are generally bullish on the EV maker.

Elon Musk donated $1.95 billion worth of Tesla shares to a charity last year, 
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
. 
 
The world's second richest person gave away about 11.6 million shares from August 12 to December 27 last year, per the filing. It did not state which charity organisation Musk gifted the shares to. 
 
""Represents a bona fide gift of the Issuer's common stock by the Reporting Person to charity,"" the report said. 
 
The Tesla CEO has made hefty donations to charities in the past. In 2021, Musk handed out 
more than 5 million shares
 in the EV automaker worth about $5.7 billion in total, based on average prices of the stock at the time.
 
Musk made the giveaway just after the 
United Nations World Food Programme
 (WFP) gave details of a plan to help fight world hunger that would cost $6 billion. 
 
His most recent donation came at a turbulent time for Tesla stock, where it plunged in value thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes, recession fears and Musk's chaotic $44 billion takeover of Twitter. The stock slumped 65% in 2022, but expectations of rate cuts in the new year have significantly boosted its share price to nearly wipe out all of last year's losses. 
 
Meanwhile, analysts have slammed Musk for using Tesla as his own ""ATM machine"" to fund his Twitter takeover. At the end of 2022, the tech guru cashed in nearly 
$40 billion of Tesla stock
 to cover tax bills and service debts. 
 
Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Slashed prices have given Tesla's Chinese sales a boost, but analysts and even fans, are warning the United States' automaker needs to raise its long game to avoid choking on the dust of fast-moving rivals in the world's biggest electric vehicle market.
 
Tesla offers two models in China: the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y crossover. This keep-it-simple approach has driven scale and lowered costs. After the latest price cuts, the Model 3 starts at 229,900 yuan ($33,500) and the Model Y at 261,900 yuan.
 
Tesla's January price cuts drove deliveries of its China-made vehicles up 18 percent from December. The company's thick profit margins have put it in a position to wage a price war on competitors in China and beyond, analysts said.
 
But they said Tesla had lagged Chinese competitors in introducing new models, improving navigation systems, adding luxury interior touches or white-glove customer service to serve the developing range of consumer preferences for EVs.
 
""Tesla's facing a serious problem of a very limited product mix,"" said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association. ""Its slowness to respond to Chinese consumers' preferences has led to a very passive positioning for Tesla to rely on few means, such as price cuts, to stay competitive.""
 
Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has conceded that China is where his company could face its toughest competition.
 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its China business. Grace Tao, Tesla's vice-president in charge of external communications in China, said previously the price cuts in China reflected engineering innovation and answered the call to encourage economic development and consumption.
 
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids to surge by 35 percent in 2023 to 9 million vehicles — nearly a third of China's total new vehicle sales.
 
While Tesla has increased sales in China, its second-largest market, it has also lost share. From 15 percent in 2020, its share of the China EV market fell by a third to just 10 percent in 2022, according to data from the CPCA.
 
BYD, which overtook Tesla by global sales volume in 2022 and has a market value well over $100 billion, offers more than 60 different versions of pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Much smaller but ambitious peer Nio has gone from two models to six over the same period and plans to launch five more this year.
 
""The aging product line is a real problem for Tesla,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. ""Once BYD and other EV startups follow to lower prices, the effect of Tesla's price cuts could vanish in the blink of an eye.""
 
Tesla has been considering a shift in its marketing in China, focusing more on energy efficiency and practical features and less on cutting-edge functionality, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
 
It has also been studying how its Chinese rivals, led by BYD, win over customers in showrooms, especially in smaller cities, the person said, who declined to be identified citing a lack of authorization to speak to the media.
 
For example, BYD ensures that bottles of drinking water offered to its showroom visitors are warm in winter in a nod to local preferences. Nio, meanwhile, invited customers to make dumplings at its showrooms to celebrate Spring Festival.
 
Qin Lihong, co-founder and president of Nio, said personal recommendations from existing customers factor in roughly 60 percent of its new sales, which hit 122,486 in 2022, up 33.86 percent year-on-year.

some of its operations to Texas
, 
ignoring the state's pandemic orders
, and Musk nearly running another Silicon Valley giant, Twitter, into the ground. 


Newsom says his relationship with Musk goes back 'decades,' but the two have engaged in some light public sparring in recent years. Musk in 2021 derided  as 'the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation.' The governor in September suggested Tesla 
wouldn't even exist
 without 's incentives. 


But none of that was brought up on Wednesday. Musk cheerfully noted that Newsom was 'one of the first to buy a 
Tesla Roadster 
back in the day' — noting he would have had to put down $100,000 to reserve one in 2007. That also means Newsom would have been one of the first ns to buy an electric vehicle. According to data from the state's energy commission, only 112 zero-emission vehicles had been sold by 2010.


'That was a healthy deposit you had to make,' Newsom said, joking he made the purchase 'back when I had money.' 


'That was a lot of money in 2007,' Musk said.


'It's still a lot of money,' Newsom replied. 'Trust me, brother, you haven't looked at my salary … We had about the same net worth back then, 20 years ago.'


The governor, who receives 
a state salary of $224,020
, reported at least $1.6 million in income, assets and investments for 2021. Newsom founded a lucrative wine and hospitality business in 1992, but 
moved the Plumpjack Group assets to a blind trust
 upon taking office in 2018. 


His office didn't respond to a question about how many Tesla vehicles he owns, but a 
2018 profile in The New Yorker
 makes mention of three Teslas in his driveway. 
 
By the end of 2022, a total of about 1.4 million ZEVs had been sold in the state, including 346,000 sold last year for nearly 19 percent of the new vehicle market.  has a goal of propelling electric vehicle sales to 100 percent of the new car market by 2035.

T​esla is opening part of its electric vehicle charging network to other brands of EVs, a move that could be a game-changer for EV sales and use. 
The plan, 
announced
 by the White House, is part of the Biden administration's efforts to combat greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, a leading 
driver
 of climate change, and also part of the infrastructure bill passed last year. 
Tesla 
has the largest EV charging network in the U.S., with more than 60% of all stations belonging to the company started by Elon Musk. Modifications will have to be made for those to work for other types of EVs, but Tesla said it is prepared to do that.

T​he lack of chargers and ""range fear"" are often cited as reasons why people don't buy EVs. 
'No matter what EV you drive, we want to make sure that you will be able to plug in, know the price you're going to be paying and charge up in a predictable, user-friendly experience,' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said, according to the Associated Press.
At least 7,500 chargers from Tesla's 
Supercharger
 or Destination Charger network will be open to other brands by the end of next year, the White House said. Superchargers are located along major highways, while the slower destination chargers are at places like hotels and restaurants.

Biden has set a goal that 50% of U.S. new car

The White House also says the expansion of EV sales, manufacturing and charging networks will create more clean energy 
jobs

B​y opening up its charging stations, Tesla can compete for federal grants authorized under the infrastructure bill. The grants are intended to help fund building of the national network.

The recall, part of a larger investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Tesla's automated driving systems, is the most serious action taken yet against the electric vehicle maker.
It raises questions about CEO Elon Musk's claims that he can prove to regulators that cars equipped with ""Full Self-Driving"" are safer than humans, and that humans almost never have to touch the controls.
Musk at one point had promised that a fleet of autonomous robotaxis would be in use in 2020. The latest action appears to push that development further into the future.
The safety agency says in documents posted on its website Thursday that Tesla will fix the concerns with an online software update in the coming weeks. The documents say Tesla is recalling the cars but does not agree with an agency analysis of the problem.

The system, which is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners, makes such unsafe actions as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, failing to come to a complete stop at stop signs, or going through an intersection during a yellow traffic light without proper caution, NHTSA said.
In addition, the system may not adequately respond to changes in posted speed limits, or it may not account for the driver's adjustments in speed, the documents said. ""FSD beta software that allows a vehicle to exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner increases the risk of a crash,"" the agency said in documents.
Musk complained Thursday on Twitter, which he now owns, that calling an over-the-air software update a recall is ""anachronistic and just flat wrong!"" A message was left Thursday seeking further comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.
Tesla has received 18 warranty claims that could be caused by the software from May 2019 through Sept. 12, 2022, the documents said. But the Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker told the agency it is not aware of any deaths or injuries.
In a statement, NHTSA said it found the problems during tests performed as part of an investigation into Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" and ""Autopilot"" software that take on some driving tasks. The investigation remains open, and the recall doesn't address the full scope of what NHTSA is scrutinizing, the agency said.
Despite the names ""Full Self-Driving"" and ""Autopilot,"" Tesla says on its website that the cars cannot drive themselves and owners must be ready to intervene at all times.
The recall announced Thursday covers certain 2016-23 Model S and Model X vehicles, as well as 2017 through 2013 Model 3s, and 2020 through 2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with the software, or with installation pending.",Copyright(c) 2009 Chosun.com All rights reserved.,2615,news,KR,en,VOA News,https://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2023/02/20/2023022000531_0.jpg,False,@TheChosunilbo,7.519478,f9d5cc66cc7e3393dd7235a28d18f46e

Tesla is still the benchmark for the 
electric vehicle
 market and smaller players are at risk of failing or being swallowed up by larger peers, according to former Ford chief executive Mark Fields. 
 
He told 
CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday
 that some of the smaller companies like 
Lucid
 run the risk of being taken over by bigger companies among the growing pack of EV makers. 
 
""I think every automaker still benchmarks Tesla as the leader at this point,"" Fields said. 
 
He noted revenue misses for both Lucid and Nikola Corp. as worrying signs. Those companies have also been plagued by persistent supply chain bottlenecks that have slowed production. 
 
And ""it's only going to get tougher"" for companies Lucid and others that are pricing vehicles in a high-end price range, where competition from big incumbent rivals like 
Mercedes
 and 
BMW
 is stiff. 
 
""One thing is for sure - these companies are going to continue to need capital to grow their businesses,"" Fields said. ""Some will succeed, and some will have to be bought by some of the larger players.""
 
Meanwhile, Fields highlighted Tesla's ability to control vertical integration when producing its vehicles, which has allowed the company to be ""the master of their own destiny of the costs."" 
 
""When you combine that with their brand, which is held in high regard [because] they were a first mover, they continue to get a premium,"" Fields said.

 -- It's a bad day to be driving a white Tesla in north Scottsdale.
According to authorities in Scottsdale, the driver of a Tesla first slammed into a building east of Scottsdale and Cactus roads around 8 a.m. Friday. Witnesses at the scene told Arizona's Family that it appeared that the driver had hit the gas pedal, instead of the brakes when it slammed into a building along 74th Place. One woman reported seeing the car parking when it 'just randomly shot forward into the building.' That witness told Arizona's Family that she stopped to help get the driver out and that the EV went up in flames less than a minute after the crash.

A few hours later, crews responded to an area about two miles away where the electric car again caught fire while it was being towed, near the busy intersection of Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Quarter. Video from the scene showed the once-white vehicle completely charred.

Elon Musk accused consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader of lying after he claimed the billionaire had taken ""taxpayers to the cleaners"" with Tesla. 
 
In a Friday tweet,
 Nader wrote that Musk ""started Tesla with a huge US government welfare grant."" However, Musk did not start Tesla as it 
was founded
 in 2003 by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. 
 
Nader, 88, accused Musk of taking ""taxpayers to the cleaners for his factories and for Starlink. He is a gigantic corporate welfare king masquerading as a capitalist businessman.""
 
 —Ralph Nader (@RalphNader) 
February 24, 2023
 
 
It was not clear why Nader made the accusations about Musk and Tesla. The tweet ends with ""-R,"" meaning it was written by Nader himself rather than one of his staff.
 
Musk responded
: ""Ralph Nader, you are lying – shame on you! I personally provided almost all Tesla funding, based on my proceeds from PayPal.""
 
Musk got about $175 million when eBay bought PayPay for $1.5 billion in 2002.
 
He became the largest shareholder in Tesla after making a $6.5 million investment in 2004 and took over as CEO in October 2008. 
 
""In late 2008, I gave Tesla the last money I had. It was that or the company would have died. We closed that funding round at 6pm on Christmas Eve,"" Musk tweeted. ""If we had not closed that round, Tesla would have gone bankrupt 2 days after Christmas. I gave my last money thinking Tesla would probably still die, not thinking that it would be lucrative.""
 
Musk added in his tweet to Nader that the ""first meaningful government funding"" Tesla received was in the second quarter of 2010. 
According to its website,
 Tesla got about $465 million from the Department of Energy to accelerate the production of 
electric vehicles
.  
 
Musk concluded that ""Tesla paid back that loan early with interest"" and ""taxpayers actually made a profit."" In a press release in May 2013, 
the EV maker said
 it had repaid the loan 
nine years early
.
 
""I would like to thank the Department of Energy and the members of Congress and their staffs that worked hard to create the ATVM program, and particularly the American taxpayer from whom these funds originate,"" Musk at the time. ""I hope we did you proud.""
 
In an 
open letter on February 17
, Nader called on Apple CEO Tim Cook and ""hedge fund titans"" to use their wealth to organize direct relief for the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria and ""other major refugee areas such as the starving children of Somalia.""

255,Mexican President Says Tesla to Build Plant in Mexico,VOA News,2023-03-02 00:00:00,date,https://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2023/03/02/2023030200558.html,chosun.com,Mexico's president announced Tuesday that electric car company Tesla has committ..,"Mexico's president announced Tuesday that electric car company Tesla has committed to building a major plant in the industrial hub of Monterrey in northern Mexico.
President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador said the promise came in phone calls he had Friday and Monday with Tesla head Elon Musk. It would be Tesla's third plant outside the U.S., after one in Shanghai and one near Berlin. 
Lopez Obrador had previously ruled out such a plant in the arid northern state of Nuevo Leon, where Monterrey is the capital, because he didn't want water-hungry factories in a region that suffers water shortages. But he said Musk's company had offered commitments to address those concerns, including using recycled water.
""There is one commitment that all the water used in the manufacture of electric automobiles will be recycled water,"" Lopez Obrador said. 
The president said it would be a large investment without giving a dollar amount and did not specify what the plant would produce. He said it was unclear if it would produce batteries, an industry Mexico desperately wants despite not having a current domestic supply of lithium.
Lopez Obrador said the company planned to release details on Wednesday. ""This is going to mean a considerable investment and many, many jobs,"" he said. ""My understanding is that it will be very big.""

◆ Investment Estimated to Be $10 Billion
Monterrey is highly industrialized and close to the U.S. border and had long been considered the frontrunner for any Tesla investment.
But the city suffered water shortages in 2022 that were so severe that many homes went weeks with intermittent or no water supply. The government is building a 100-kilometer pipeline to bring in water from a dam.
Lopez Obrador had previously said his government ""simply won't grant permits"" for any new plants there. Apparently Musk's proposal overrode the president's stance.
Gabriela Siller, chief economist at Nuevo Leon-based Banco Base, said the Tesla investment -- which she estimated could be worth $10 billion -- represented such a large amount that it trumped any of the president's objections. Lopez Obrador ""could not turn this down. It would have had a very big political cost for him,"" said Siller.
The announcement was a disappointment for more water-rich southern states that had begun jockeying for the Tesla plant after Lopez Obrador's comments last week.
The governor of Nuevo Leon state, where billboards went up last year saying, ""Welcome Tesla,"" crowed about Tuesday's announcement. ""Mexico won, Nuevo Leon (NL) won, WE ALL WIN!"" Governor Samuel García wrote on his Twitter account.
Lopez Obrador said Mexico wouldn't match any U.S. subsidies to win the Tesla plant, referring to U.S. incentives under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. ""We cannot give subsidies like that,"" the president said, adding ""Mr. Musk was very attentive, respectful"" of Mexico's position.
Tesla is expected to announce plans for its ""Gen 3"" vehicle platform on Wednesday at its annual investor day at a factory near Austin, Texas. 
Musk previously has floated the idea of building a $25,000 electric vehicle, which would cost about $20,000 less than the current Model 3, now Tesla's least-expensive car. Many automakers build lower-cost models in Mexico to save on labor costs and protect profit margins.
Musk also is expected to show off the company's production line at the Austin plant, as well as discuss long-term expansion plans, how it will spend capital investment dollars, and other subjects.",Copyright(c) 2009 Chosun.com All rights reserved.,2615,news,KR,en,VOA News,https://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2023/03/02/2023030200554_0.jpg,False,@TheChosunilbo,8.353114,6e906b59e239fd407fcbbc1cb69d78d0

CEO Elon Musk and other executives outlined the goals during a lengthy investor day presentation at Tesla's Austin, Texas, headquarters Wednesday.
 
The changes could bring the cost of a new generation of vehicles to around $25,000, although it didn't appear that the new vehicle would be introduced during the presentation.
 
Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla's design chief, said the company has to make another sharp reduction in costs in order to reach its ambitious electric-vehicle production targets.
 
The company, he said, will build the cars in smaller modular units, then bring those units together. The system uses less space. Executives said as a result, its next electric powertrain factory will be half the size of the one Tesla just built in Austin, costing 65% less.
 
'That also means we can build more factories at the same time,' said Tom Zhu, who leads Tesla manufacturing.
 
Executives said Tesla is unique from other automakers because all of the people involved in vehicle design and manufacturing are in the same room. The company also designs and makes many of its parts and software while others rely on tiers of parts supply companies.

In after-hours trading, shares in tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) were down by over 5% following Elon Musk's annual presentation, which spooked investors. Rather than the widely anticipated specifics on a sub $30,000 electric vehicle, his comments focused on a 'Master Plan 3' towards a fully sustainable earth, requiring investment of some $10 trillion.

In London, the ftse 100 is expected to open broadly flat. This follows a caution by the Bank of England's chief Andrew Bailey, that interest rates may have to rise further as Threadneedle street balances the continuing conundrum of stubborn inflation and a fragile housing market.

Later today Eurozone inflation data is due for the Eurozone with consensus expecting the rate of price growth to slow from 8.6% at the last check to 8.2%. However, with France, Spain and Germany all seeing inflation rising over February, there is some room for disappointment.

The world's largest brewer, AB InBev, which owns brands such as Budweiser and Corona has reported 2022 results, expanding volumes by 2.3%, which combined with robust pricing and a trend towards premiumization drove revenue growth of 11.2% to $57.8 billion.

Underlying operating profit growth was more muted at 5.4%, held back by currency headwinds and higher commodity costs. In 2023, the company anticipates EBITDA to grow in line with its medium-term outlook of between 4-8%, and revenue to increase at a faster rate.

Given the growth in beer sales one might also expect a strong performance in hangover cures. Consumer health giant Haleon, the maker of Panadol and Advil, has put out its maiden full year numbers. Revenues grew 13.8% to £10.9m with underlying operating margins maintained at 22.8%.

Free cash flow came in at $1.6bn enabling the repayment of a £1.5bn term loan. Net debt was £9.9bn down from £10.7bn at the time of the gsk plc (LON:GSK) merger. The debt position equates to 3.6x underlying cash profits, on track to fall below 3x in 2024.

The group's 2023 guidance expects organic revenue growth of 4-6% and flat underlying operating margins assuming no changes in currency rates. The Board proposed an inaugural final dividend of 2.4p per share.

Meanwhile, Brent Crude remains over $84 dollars holding on to earlier gains in the week, fueled by hopes of rising demand in China.'

However, the event, where Musk revealed the EV maker's 'Master Plan 3', was short on details about the timeline or any new Tesla products.

'The markets were primed for a big announcement, perhaps on something like a more affordable new model,' said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

'Tesla had been on a tear so far in 2023. Then Musk raises his head above the parapet in an investor day presentation and the shares are sputtering ... It may just have been a case of failing to live up to the hype.'

The stock, which had lost about two-thirds of its value in 2022, has climbed more than 60% so far this year.

'The timeline and cost details were limited, and the event lacked a Tesla-like surprise,' Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan said.

Tesla's events have created a stir on the internet in the past, with Musk's dance moves at the opening of the company's Berlin plant in 2022 and an event in China in 2020 going viral on social media.

Tesla
 slammed into a building in Arizona on Friday, catching fire not once, but twice.
Witnesses said a teen was trying to park the car before crashing.
Alexandra Toepel shared cell phone video showing the fiery accident in Scottsdale.
'It went up in flames in about 30 seconds,' she said. 'I got out of my car, and I helped the mom take her daughter from the driver's seat, and she was bleeding quite a bit and everything, but we moved her from the car to the ground.'
The two got the teen driver, who suffered some burns, away from the flames.
'I was just so thankful I could be there at that moment,' Toepel said. 'The mom didn't have her cell phone to call anybody or anything like that, so it was a really scary moment.'
Not long after that scary moment ended, another one began nearby as the same Tesla burst into flames a second time while on the back of a tow truck.
The car was then lowered to the street.
Robert Vidaca, another tow truck driver, rushed over to help.
'I seen it from a distance and … my heart dropped for [the truck driver] because I know it's … definitely a scary situation to be in, especially in the middle of an intersection,' he said.
Vidaca said the fire started as a little flame, so they tried to put it out.
'I hopped off my truck, off my tow truck … and I tried to help them out with my fire extinguisher, and nothing,' he said. 'Within a couple of minutes, we noticed that the flames were just getting out of control.'
The 
Scottsdale Fire Department
 said electric car fires take longer to put out compared to traditional car fires. They also require multiple agencies and Hazmat crews because of the potential hazards to the community.
Several businesses nearby were evacuated as a precaution, and the tow truck driver was taken to the hospital.
'And he just looked like he was just completely covered in smoke,' Vidaca said. 'But … he was walking around. He was fine. He was very appreciative of me stopping by and helping him out with the whole situation and everything.'
The exact cause of both fires is still under investigation.

'It went up in flames in about 30 seconds,' she said. 'I got out of my car, and I helped the mom take her daughter from the driver's seat, and she was bleeding quite a bit and everything, but we moved her from the car to the ground.'
The two got the teen driver, who suffered some burns, away from the flames.
'I was just so thankful I could be there at that moment,' Toepel said. 'The mom didn't have her cell phone to call anybody or anything like that, so it was a really scary moment.'
Not long after that scary moment ended, another one began nearby as the same Tesla burst into flames a second time while on the back of a tow truck.
The car was then lowered to the street.
Robert Vidaca, another tow truck driver, rushed over to help.
'I seen it from a distance and … my heart dropped for [the truck driver] because I know it's … definitely a scary situation to be in, especially in the middle of an intersection,' he said.
Vidaca said the fire started as a little flame, so they tried to put it out.
'I hopped off my truck, off my tow truck … and I tried to help them out with my fire extinguisher, and nothing,' he said. 'Within a couple of minutes, we noticed that the flames were just getting out of control.'
The 
Scottsdale Fire Department
 said electric car fires take longer to put out compared to traditional car fires. They also require multiple agencies and Hazmat crews because of the potential hazards to the community.
Several businesses nearby were evacuated as a precaution, and the tow truck driver was taken to the hospital.
'And he just looked like he was just completely covered in smoke,' Vidaca said. 'But … he was walking around. He was fine. He was very appreciative of me stopping by and helping him out with the whole situation and everything.'
The exact cause of both fires is still under investigation.

Known as the ""War of Current,"" this debate between alternating and direct current electricity became one of the greatest feuds in American history between Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla and businessman Thomas Alva Edison. At the center of this clash, Tesla famously argued electricity should be given to the masses at no cost, no matter their class or creed, while Edison wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the world's growing need to power their homes and lives into the future.

This new and original production follows two of history's greatest genius inventors as they clash over their disparate visions of the future. See how the race to light up the world, and at what cost, began with these two brilliant and fiercely competitive men.

 said the next phase of 

 Inc.'s growth will be built around a sustainable energy future, one that can serve a larger world population and be achieved without great economic sacrifice.
 
The automaker's Master Plan 3 three-hour presentation Wednesday disappointed some investors who were expecting new-product information, including details of the future Gen 3 platform.  shares fell as much as 6.8% to $189 in extended trading.
 
Musk, 51, outlined his vision for a global switch to 
electric vehicles
, driven by $10 trillion in spending to develop sustainable energy worldwide. The company's investor event was streamed live from 's factory in Austin, Texas. 
 
'Earth will move to a sustainable energy economy,' 's chief executive officer said. 'And it will happen in your lifetime.'
 
In its own drive for efficiency, the EV maker plans to reduce the footprint of future manufacturing plants by 40%. Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn vowed to cut production costs in half for 's next-generation vehicles.
 
One product  could expand to is heat pumps. Musk and Drew Baglino, his senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, said heat pumps could dramatically cut home and office-heating costs, calling them one of the low hanging fruit of the transition to sustainable energy. 
 
 went to great lengths to introduce several executives who are largely unknown to investors. For example, Rebecca Tinucci, the head of global charging infrastructure, took to the stage to talk about the company's Supercharger network and the 'Magic Dock' that lets drivers of other EVs charge at  stations.
 
Musk bought Twitter in October, leading some investors to wonder if he's spread himself too thin. Letting so many other executives share the limelight shows  has a deep bench of talent.
 
The company also touted its growing ability to get production facilities up and running quickly.  said it has broken ground on a lithium refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, and aims to start output of battery-grade lithium chemicals within 12 months.
 
'That's the target,' Baglino said. 
 
What attendees and online audience didn't hear was when  will unveil its next-generation vehicle, with management saying that would come at a 'later date.'  did say again that the Cybertuck is coming this year, with volume production expected in 2024.
 
The new corporate vision aims to build upon the U.S. electric vehicle market leader's growth from a niche player into a mainstream automotive manufacturer. 's two previous strategic plans were unveiled in 2006 and 2016. 
 
Scores of investors flocked to Austin for the invitation-only event, where  planned to showcase its 'most advanced production line.' Management was scheduled to discuss topics including long-term growth, next-generation vehicle architecture and capital spending plans, the company said.
 
Musk published his first Master Plan more than a decade ago, laying out 's go-to-market strategy of building an electric 
sports car
, then a series of more affordable cars. The company has executed on that vision with the Roadster, the 
Model S
 and then the 
Model 3
 sedan — its cheapest vehicle which starts at around $43,000.

269,Tesla likely getting $330-million-plus in additional Nevada tax breaks,Associated Press,2023-02-28 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/02/28/tesla-seeks-nevada-tax-breaks-300-million/,autoblog.com,Tesla may receive over $300 million in tax abatements over the next two decades for a massive new expansion of its northern Nevada facility.,"RENO, Nev. — 
Tesla
 may receive over $300 million in tax abatements over the next two decades for a massive new expansion of its northern Nevada facility, the product of a 2014 deal for when the company first came to the area on the promise of new jobs and major investments in the area.
 
The long-awaited sum — kept quiet for a month due to a 
nondisclosure agreement with state officials
 — will be voted on Thursday by the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development. Tesla projects it will bring in 3,000 jobs at an average rate of $33.49 per hour and invest $3.6 billion into the economy. It will cover health 
insurance
 for 91% of its employees, per its application.
 
Many have attributed Tesla's presence in northern Nevada to both economic diversification and fast-rising housing costs.
 
Combined with both its 2014 investment and project expansion where the company received over $1 billion in tax breaks, Tesla is set for over $10 billion in capital investments in northern Nevada between 2014 and 2028, which economic development board director Tom Burns called 'ground zero for the energy transition' in a Monday release. The company projected over $750 million in direct and indirect tax revenue from the proposed tax breaks and those approved in 2014.
 
'On behalf of Tesla and its 7,000+ Nevada team members, we are grateful to you and your team for your partnership on this critical project,' Chris Reilly, Tesla's director of workforce and recruiting, wrote to Burns on Thursday.
 
The company could also be reimbursed for upwards of $80 million in sales and use taxes over two decades, which would not be part of the $330 million in already-abated taxes.
 
In recent weeks, however, the proposed tax abatements have been the subject of scrutiny by some lawmakers in Nevada's Democratic-controlled legislature, where some have questioned the authority that the board should have over such massive investments and requested to delay the Thursday vote to give more time for public comment.
 
Concerns rose over a lack of oversight for the board to provide such massive tax breaks, as well as some Tesla employees being on Medicaid, despite the average hourly wage being much higher than the qualifying income. Some democratic lawmakers requested Thursday's meeting be postponed, though it appears to still be on schedule.
 
Following the disclosure of Tesla's request Monday, Senate Revenue and Economic Development Committee Chair Dina Neal, D-North Las Vegas, again called for a delay on the vote.
 
'As I said last week, allowing only three days for the public to review what we now know to be $330 million in corporate tax breaks and abatements is insufficient,' she said in a release. 'There is little to no opportunity to explore how this deal may affect housing supply, public schools, public safety, and other vital government services in the region.'
 
Tesla, run by billionaire CEO 
Elon Musk,
 intends to produce high volumes of semitrucks and make enough cell 
batteries
 for 2 million light-duty vehicles annually in Nevada.
 
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo announced the expansion in January, which applies to an existing operation at the 
Tahoe
 Reno Industrial Center, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Reno-Sparks. The plan takes the company a step closer to accomplishing previously announced plans to ramp up production of fully electric Tesla Semi vehicles, in order to make 50,000 
trucks
 in North America in 2024.
 
President Joe Biden
's administration has 
pointed to the Nevada factory
 expansion as evidence of a continued 'manufacturing boom' since he took office two years ago.
 
Several entities sent letters in support of the expansion. Among them was University of Nevada, Reno President Brian Sandoval, who approved the $1.3 billion abatement deal in 2014 as governor, and a preschool based at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center that said it will expand its hours to accommodate the expansion.
 
In a letter to Lombardo and Burns from Storey County, where Tesla's factory is located, three county commissioners lauded the economic boom the company has brought northern Nevada while bringing up concerns over the amount of staffing and resources needed to support such a facility in their rural county, including fire and EMS, law enforcement, infrastructure and staffing. The county took much of the hit from the original 10-year tax abatement plan, and the county will need increased tax revenues to help support the expansion, they said. The commissioners asked that county officials participate in the March 2 meeting.
 
'Nevertheless, Storey County is poised to accept and respond to the needs of a second Gigafactory and continue its positive working relationship with the Tesla team,' the commissioners wrote.
 
Tesla's presence is one of several in northern Nevada that has pushed the region to the forefront of the U.S. transition to green energy, a major goal of the Biden administration as it seeks to move away from gas-powered cars in the larger fight against 
climate change
.
 
This includes construction on a lithium mine that survived legal hurdles from tribal leaders and environmentalists last week and may start construction as early as this week.
 
Also included is a Nevada-based 
battery recycling
 plant used for 
electric vehicle
 batteries that won a 
$2 billion green energy loan from the Biden administration
 earlier this month. The company, Redwood Materials, was founded by a former Tesla executive and 
received $105 million in state tax abatements
 in December on a promise to expand its operations in the region and help the U.S. establish its own electric-vehicle supply chain.
 
'This region is leading the way to a broader story of what is happening in the country,' U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said while announcing the Department of Energy loan.
 
Last week, state Treasurer Zach Conine and Lombardo's chief of staff Ben Kieckhefer presented a bill that would allow funds from the State Infrastructure Bank to go toward housing for large economic development projects that are abated through the governor's economic development office — like Tesla and Redwood.

Current Morningstar Fair Value Estimate: $225
Tesla Stock Star Rating: 3 stars
Economic Moat Rating: Narrow
Moat Trend Rating: Stable
 
Tesla Investor Day Update
 
After updating our outlook after Tesla's 
TSLA 
investor day, we raise our fair value estimate to $225 per share from $220. The increase is due to our improved long-term outlook for the company's free cash flow generation. Our narrow-moat rating is unchanged.
 
Tesla Stock Slightly Undervalued
 
At current prices, we view Tesla shares as slightly undervalued, with the stock trading roughly 15% below our fair value estimate. We attribute the selloff to the market's disappointment at the lack of details surrounding the new affordable vehicle platform as well as the lack of publicly stated long-term financial targets. We agree with the sentiment that the entry-level vehicle is not likely to be in commercial production over the next couple of years, which should lead to lower deliveries and profits in the medium term. However, we forecast Tesla will eventually bring this new model into production, driving long-term deliveries growth.
 
Tesla's Ability to Scale
 
In our view, the more important takeaway from the event is that Tesla's ability to scale should drive higher long-term free cash flow generation. Tesla's software-focused operation, including using AI for much of its R&D, should drive long-term operating leverage, leading to margin expansion. The company's plan to simplify its manufacturing process should reduce its capital expenditure intensity over time. As a result, we reduced our long-term assumptions for overhead expenses and capital expenditures.
 
Additionally, we increased our outlook for the energy generation and storage business as we think Tesla's software, including virtual machine mode and autobidder, will drive higher sales as it will allow excess cost savings versus the installation of solar and a battery alone.
 
Finally, during the event, Tesla reiterated its long-term plan to sell 20 million vehicles per year. Our vehicle deliveries forecast is unchanged at a little more than 5 million deliveries in 2030.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Seth Goldstein",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/A3T4NM45BUIIFSHE35EDSJH75U.png,False,@MorningstarInc,6.8373694,b7c9713fe218345aff396cd91613d7d9

There will be a new Model Y next year with updated design and fresh interior decoration, as well as powertrain enhancements. The mid-cycle Tesla Model Y upgrade is called 'Project Juniper' internally, but it will come about a year after Tesla releases the new 'Highland' Model 3 this September. 
E-Mobility






It costs Tesla just US$39,393 to make a Model Y, according to 
Sandy Munro's part-by-part analysis
, but that manufacturing expenditure may be lowered even further when the 2024 Model Y upgrade hits the market. Tesla is reportedly working on a Model Y with new body design, refreshed interior, and probably powertrain upgrades as well.


Tesla is apparently modeling the upgrade after its ""
Project Highland"" undertaking that will see a Model 3 refresh
 released in September this year, according to  sources. For the new Model 3 and Model Y, Elon Musk is shifting focus on improving redundancies in design or engineering, and streamlining production to keep margins intact amidst the EV price war that Tesla itself started in January.


It is not yet clear what the Model Y ""Juniper"" redesign would entail, but for the new Model 3's interior, Tesla is reportedly aiming at a more minimalistic look that will focus on the features that drivers actually use in the car. Apart from a new, large central display console, that is. The last Model S overhaul hid all buttons and vents, so the new Model 3 and Model Y would probably undergo a similar transformation.


As for when will the 2024 Tesla Model Y upgrade be released, the sources say next October, which would be about a year after the Model 3 ""Highland"" redesign that is slated for this fall. While the new Model 3 sedan will first be assembled at Giga Shanghai, the Model Y has been a bestselling vehicle in many markets for a while now, and Tesla would probably have to introduce the Juniper upgrade's manufacturing process simultaneously across more of its factories.

Elon Musk has suggested Warren Buffett should buy 
Tesla
 stock, and revealed Charlie Munger had the chance to invest in the automaker at less than 0.1% of its current valuation.
 
Twitter user @gurgavin 
posted
 on Saturday that Buffett and Munger's 
Berkshire Hathaway
 had 
over $128 billion in cash
 at the end of 2022, and asked which stocks the conglomerate should spend its money on.
 
""Starts with a T …"" Musk 
replied
.
 
""Munger could've invested in Tesla at ~$200M valuation when I had lunch with him in late 2008,"" he 
added
.
 
Musk's tweet suggests that Munger — Buffett's 99-year-old business partner and Berkshire's vice-chairman — could have bought, say, 5% of Tesla for a measly $10 million in 2008.
 
Tesla went public two years later, securing a roughly $2 billion valuation. Its market capitalization skyrocketed during the pandemic, peaking at over $1.2 trillion in November 2021. The electric-vehicle company was still worth $617 billion as of Friday's close.
 
Assuming Munger invested in 2008 and never sold any shares (and ignoring any dilution), he would have made 10 times his money on paper by the time of Tesla's IPO. Moreover, his 5% stake would have briefly been worth $60 billion in November 2021 — 6,000 times his initial investment, and approaching 10% of Berkshire's entire market capitalization and 60% of Buffett's net worth.
 
While Tesla stock has roughly halved since then, Munger's hypothetical position would still be worth about $31 billion today, or more than 3,000 times his original wager.
 
In reality, Munger declined to bet on Tesla in 2008, and instead spearheaded Berkshire's 
$232 million investment in BYD
 that year. Berkshire's stake in the Chinese EV maker and Tesla rival ballooned in value to over $7 billion by early 2021, and the company has cashed in 
well over $1 billion
 of BYD stock in recent months.
 
Munger and Buffett have never publicly invested in Tesla, but both men have weighed in on Musk and his car company.
 
Munger, 99, 
recently described
 Musk as a ""very talented man but also peculiar,"" and said he neither invests nor bets against the executive's companies. He's also 
underscored
 Musk's positive contributions to civilization, and labeled Tesla's survival in the brutally competitive automotive industry a ""minor miracle.""
 
Buffett has also 
hailed
 Musk and Tesla's unlikely success. While Musk has noted he 
isn't the investor's biggest fan
 and considers running Berkshire to be a pretty boring job, he's also 
acknowledged
 Buffett's skill and valuable role in the US economy.
 
It seems unlikely that Buffett and Munger will invest in Tesla anytime soon, given they own a chunk of a rival automaker, and have shied away from aggressively valued technology companies in the past. But Musk would clearly welcome their 
vote of confidence
, and seems happy to give Munger a second chance to buy his stock.

This study proposes a new near zero-wear non-contact self-impact seal based on the passive fluid blocking principle and the Tesla valve structure, which is characterised by near zero-wear, a long lifetime, a simple structure and high stability. Research shows that the impact-blocking effect of a three-dimensional leakage channel can realise the stepwise throttling effect of the sealing medium. Furthermore, the pressure, number of seal stages and seal spacing significantly affect leakage. Leakage can be effectively controlled by increasing seal series and reducing seal spacing. The proposed near zero-wear impact seal is more suitable for the gas medium. Compared with the conventional sealing form, the new seal is simplified significantly. Large spacing and fixed design can significantly improve the ability to seal pairs to resist vibration and impact during operation, and the sealing performance is not restricted by the rotation speed. The form of the proposed seal will enable a new non-contact mechanical seal technology and a new structure to be developed, thereby advancing the existing seal field.

Calendar year 
2022 marks
 the eighth consecutive win for GM in the 'Overall Loyalty to Manufacturer' category
""The past three years have been a challenge for the automotive industry,"" said 
Joe LaFeir
, President, Automotive Insights, S&P Global Mobility. ""As customers are returning back to market post pandemic and inventory levels have slowly improved from last year's lows, retaining loyal customers has been more challenging than ever before.""
Industry-wide inventory shortages prompted many consumers to shop other brands if their previously chosen brand did not have sufficient stock. From pre-pandemic 2019, overall industry average loyalty has decreased from 54.6% to 50.2% in 2022.
Calendar year 
2022 marks
 the eighth consecutive win for GM in the 'Overall Loyalty to Manufacturer' category, and 19
th
 win in the last 27 years. Consistent demand for GM's sport-utility and pickup offerings, in addition to rising Inventory levels, led to strong loyalty gains for the manufacturer throughout 2022.
On top of its 'Overall Loyalty to Make' recognition, Tesla scored repeat wins for 'Highest Conquest Percentage' and ""Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to Make.' The combination of an active return-to-market consumer base and majority share of BEV sales were contributors to Tesla's loyalty performance this year. However, the brand's resonance with ethnic consumers was a key driver in its recognition for loyalty improvement and diversity retention.
Ethnic consumers represented 40% of all personal vehicle registrations for 2022, an increase of two percentage points from the previous year. For more than 15 years, Ethnic customer retention has been part of the loyalty awards program in various forms. For 2022, S&P Global Mobility has combined the diverse consumer base under one category, 'Ethnic Market Loyalty to Make,' to reflect the combined growth in the ethnic market over the last several years. Tesla was the winner of this year's award as 52% of its loyal volume came from ethnic consumers.
""Ethnic buyers have increased their market share in the industry every year for the last decade, making them an important audience in building loyalty success for the foreseeable future,"" said 
Vince Palomarez
, product manager, Loyalty, at S&P Global Mobility.
Mercedes-Benz, with the successful launch of the EQS, was recognized this year as the winner for 'Most Improved Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to Make' award, recognizing a brand's improvement in its ability to retain an owner to both the brand and either a BEV or hybrid powertrain.
Subaru scored its first win in the 'Overall Loyalty to Dealer' category as 38 percent of Subaru owners returning to market acquired their next vehicle from the same dealer.

 for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court 
no later than 
April 28, 2023
. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: 
We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over

DETAILS OF THE CASE: 
According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants had overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving ""FSD"" technologies; (2) Tesla's Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Tesla was subjected to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

WHY ROSEN LAW: 
We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday it has dispatched a special crash investigation team to look into the Feb. 18 crash in Northern California that killed the Tesla driver and critically injured a passenger.
The probe is part of a larger investigation by the agency into Teslas on Autopilot repeatedly crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday it has dispatched a special crash investigation team to look into the Feb. 18 crash in Northern California where emergency responders had to cut open the Tesla to remove the passenger. Four Contra Costa County firefighters had minor injuries.
The probe is part of a 
larger investigation
 by the agency into multiple instances of Teslas on Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes.
The $1.4 million ladder truck was damaged in the crash on Interstate 680. The truck was parked to shield a crew clearing another accident, fire officials said.
The driver of the 2014 Tesla Model S was declared dead at the scene.
NHTSA is investigating how Tesla's Autopilot system detects and responds to emergency vehicles parked on highways. At least 15 Teslas have crashed into emergency vehicles nationwide while using the system.
Authorities said the truck had its lights on and was parked diagonally on northbound lanes of the freeway to protect responders to an earlier accident that did not result in injuries.
The fatal accident occurred around 4 a.m., and it took several hours to clear the freeway. The firetruck had to be towed away.
The Model S was among the nearly 363,000 vehicles Tesla recalled in February because of potential flaws in 'Full Self-Driving' a more sophisticated partially automated driving system.
The recall, to be done with an online software update, is aimed at correcting possible problems at intersections and with speed limits.
Despite their names, Tesla has said both systems are advanced driver assist systems and that human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.
Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its public relations department.

287,The Tesla Cybertruck's giant windshield wiper's dirty secret revealed,Gary Gastelu,2023-03-10 00:00:00,date,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/tesla-cybertrucks-giant-windshield-wipers-dirty-secret,foxnews.com,A new image of the Tesla Cybertruck reveals how well its large single windshield wiper clears the glass area of the all-electric pickup truck.,"The Tesla Cybertruck
 is big in a lot of ways.
The 
full-size electric truck
 is over 6 feet tall, 19 feet long and has a flat enormous windshield that is like nothing on any pickup today.
During the vehicle's longer than planned development, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said there was ""no easy solution"" to designing a wiper for the windshield.
""The wiper is what troubles me most,"" Musk said of the challenge.
TESLA'S 1950S-STYLE DRIVE-IN DINER AND MOVIE CHARGING STATION REVEALED
 
 
The solution ended up being a single huge wiper that is the biggest on any retail vehicle today.
Images of prototype trucks indicate that it stows vertically along the driver's side roof pillar when not in use and otherwise works conventionally, but how well?
Tesla designer Franz von Holzhausen posted an image to Twitter of him standing in front of a dusty Cybertruck in a construction site at Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas, after taking it for a test drive.
Insider 
first pointed out that you can see the area cleared by the wiper by the dust that has been left. It reaches most of the glass, but leaves a large section of the top corner on the passenger side unswept.
 
 
Federal regulations require that wipers clear 80% of the windshield, and it appears to meet if not exceed that standard, but the remaining patch may prove to be unsightly for the person sitting behind it. Video of the Cybertruck's wiper in action has not yet surfaced, so it is unclear how quickly it moves across its arc.

The only other passenger vehicles with monoblades in recent years were Mercedes-Benz models from the 1980s and 1990s, which featured a centrally-mounted wiper with an ""eccentric sweep"" that allowed it to clear 86% of the glass.
It was long enough to reach the sides, but dipped as it passed the vertical position to clear the top of the windshield. Cost and maintenance issues led to its discontinuation.
 
 
Tesla has been thinking of reinventing the wiper, however, 
and has filed a patent
 that uses a magnetic linear actuator that slides the base of the wiper along the bottom of the windshield as it sweeps, allowing it to provide more coverage.

290,Tesla price cuts: Flagging demand or tactic to boost sales?,Associated Press,2023-03-06 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/03/06/tesla-price-cuts-flagging-demand-or-tactic-to-boost-sales,ny1.com,"In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps","DETROIT (AP) — In explaining why Tesla Inc. keeps cutting prices on its electric vehicles, the auto industry is pretty much divided into two camps.
 
On one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.
 
On the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers.
 
Over the weekend, Tesla cut the prices of its two costliest vehicles, from $5,000 to $10,000, or from 4.3% to just over 9%. A Model S two-motor sedan now starts at $89,990, with the Plaid ""performance"" version beginning at $109,990. A Model X SUV dual motor starts at $99,990, the performance version at $109,990.
 
It was the company's second price cut of the year in the United States. In January, Tesla 
slashed prices on several versions of its EVs
, making some of them eligible for a new federal tax credit. The company cut U.S. prices nearly 20% on some versions of its top-selling Model Y SUV. It also reduced the base price of the Model 3, its least expensive vehicle, by about 6%. 
 
Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, suggested that Tesla is trying to strike a balance between securing the best prices possible and sustaining buyer demand so that its factories run fast enough to reduce the cost of producing each vehicle.
 
The company does have higher profit margins than other automakers, Goldstein said, in part because it has devised more efficient manufacturing methods and because EVs have fewer moving parts to assemble
 
'This could be a way for Tesla to hold off some of the new entrants' into the EV market, Goldstein said. The company is sending a message to rivals that 'you have to offer the best technology at a compelling price while keeping your costs down.'
 
Goldstein said he doesn't foresee additional Tesla price cuts this year, unless the U.S. economy were to slide into a recession.
 
Sales of the Models S and X represent only a fraction of Tesla's overall sales, but they had been rising over the past two years. Still, from the third quarter of last year to the fourth quarter, their sales fell just over 8%.
 
Sam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, noted that both models are expensive, out of reach of mainstream buyers. And they are aging, another factor in their flagging sales: The S debuted in 2012, the X in 2015.
 
Abuelsamid said he suspects that Tesla decided to cut prices after demand for the two higher-priced vehicles fell in January and February. Because Tesla reports sales only quarterly, its sales picture won't be clear until early April. 
 
The latest price cuts, he said, should reduce the values of used Teslas simply because the new ones will cost less.
 
Though Tesla updated the interiors, electronics and performance of its Plaid editions, their exteriors still look basically as they did when they were first introduced. As a result , Abuelsamid said, the Teslas look older than similar models being produced by startups and legacy automakers.
 
'Under the skin there are a lot of differences' in the Teslas, he said. 'Customers don't really see those differences.'
 
During Tesla's investor day event last week, CEO Elon Musk conceded that affordability remains a drag on sales.
 
'The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,"" Musk asserted. 'The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.'
 
In January, when Tesla announced its earlier price cuts, more versions of its popular Model Y small SUV became eligible for a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit by bringing them under government price caps. That round of Tesla price cuts didn't spark a price war as some analysts expected, though Ford did reduce the price of its Mustang Mach-E, a Model Y competitor. 
 
Abuelsamid noted that there's still limited availability for high-end luxury SUVs made by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others because automakers aren't producing many of them. Over time, he said, the other automakers could be forced to cut prices on their luxury models.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the probe covers an estimated 120,000 vehicles from the 2023 model year.
The agency says in both cases the Model Ys were delivered to customers with a missing bolt that holds the wheel to the steering column. A friction fit held the steering wheels on, but they separated when force was exerted while the SUVs were being driven.
The agency says in documents posted on its website Wednesday that both incidents happened while the SUVs had low mileage on them.
Investigators look at how often the problem happens, how many vehicles were affected and at Tesla's manufacturing process. The Model Y is Tesla's top-selling vehicle.
Messages were left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.
In one complaint filed with NHTSA, an owner said he was driving with his family on Route 1 in Woodbridge, New Jersey, when the steering wheel suddenly came off on Jan. 29. The owner wrote that there were no cars behind him, and he was able to pull toward the road divider. There were no injuries in the Tesla, which was purchased on Jan. 24.
The complaint has a link to a Twitter posting from the owner that included a video of the detached steering wheel and pictures of the white Tesla being towed.
At first a Tesla service center gave the owner a cost estimate of $103.96 to repair the problem. The service center apologized in what appear to be text messages posted on Twitter.
When the owner wrote that he had lost faith in Tesla and asked for a refund, the service center removed the charge and wrote that Tesla doesn't have a return policy, but he could reach out to the sales and delivery team.
The man was later given the option of keeping the car or getting it replaced with a new one, according to his post on Twitter.

Detached steering wheels are rare in the auto industry, but not unprecedented. In February, Nissan recalled about 1,000 Ariya electric vehicles because the wheels could come off of the steering column due to a loose bolt.
Yet the latest NHTSA investigation adds to a long string of problems that Tesla is having with the U.S. road safety agency. In the past three years it has opened investigations of Tesla's 'Autopilot' driver-assist system
 crashing into parked emergency vehicles
, and problems with suspensions. At least 14 Teslas have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot system.
The agency also is investigating complaints that Teslas can brake suddenly for no reason.
In February, NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling 
nearly 363,000 vehicles with 'Full Self-Driving' software
 because the system can break traffic laws. The system, which cannot drive itself, is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners. But NHTSA said in documents that it can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to changes in posted speed limits.
The 
U.S. Justice Department also has asked Tesla
 for documents from Tesla about 'Full Self-Driving' and Autopilot.
NHTSA has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes in which automated systems are suspected of being used. Nineteen people have died in those crashes, 
including two motorcyclists.
Since January of 2022, Tesla has issued 20 recalls, including several that were required by NHTSA. The recalls include one from January of last year for 'Full Self-Driving' vehicles being programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds.

296,How Tesla Plans To Distance Itself from Problematic Supply Chains,Editor OilPrice.com,2023-03-10 00:00:00,date,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-plans-distance-itself-problematic-000000747.html,yahoo.com,Tesla's plans to stop using rare earths in its next-generation EVs has caused shares of rare earth minersto plummet,"Shares of Australian rare earths developers Lynas Rare Earths Ltd (OTCPK:LYSCF)(ASX:LYC) and Arafura Rare Earths Ltd (OTCPK:ARAFF)(ASX: ARU) have tanked after Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) outlined plans to stop using rare earths in its next-generation EVs at the company's investor day event last week.
They aren't alone. Rare Earths miners across the board are getting the wind knocked out of their sails, from East to West, from China to Australia.
Tesla has already cut rare earth usage in its cars by 25% in a bid to distance itself from the problematic supply chain, and last week's announcement has upended this market segment.
LYSCF shares have lost ~10% over the past five trading sessions, accentuating a sharp slide that kicked off in February. The shares have now crashed 24% over the past 30 days while ARAFF is down 16% over the timeframe, virtually erasing early-year gains for LYSCF.
Just like what we have witnessed with the lithium markets over the past two years, EV makers have been scrambling to secure supplies of rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium leading to a supply squeeze and skyrocketing prices.
EV makers use rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium, or NdPr, in their permanent magnets. Neodymium prices jumped to 1.5 m
illion yuan per tonne in early 2022 from 203,000 yuan per tonne in the space of just six months amid an acute supply squeeze. Neodymium prices have since then undergone a big correction to trade at a current 815,000 yuan, still multiples higher to levels just a couple of years ago.
Adamas Intelligence and IDTechEx have said that Tesla will most likely shift to ferrite magnets, though they come with a significant weight and  efficiency penalty.
The rare earth miner big selloff appears like overreaction considering that Adamas says it will affect less than 5% of the global NdFeB market:
""The global NdFeB market stands to lose a mere 2% to 3% of demand in the near-term, and maximum 3% to 4% over the long-term assuming Tesla maintains its EV market leadership,"" Adamas estimates.
LFP Batteries
This is hardly the first time that Tesla will be tinkering with its battery architecture.
Back in 2020, Tesla revealed that it'sswitching battery chemistry for all standard-range Models 3 and Y from nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA) chemistry to an alternative, older technology that uses a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry.
LFP cells not only have much longer useful lifetimes but are also cheaper than NCA or nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells. The biggest trade-off is that LFP batteries have a lower energy density. However, LFP batteries are still able to compensate for this shortcoming by dramatically cutting on thermal runaway in the event of a crash, meaning an LFP battery pack requires much less volume on cooling and structural protection to keep the cells separated.
Many electric buses in China already use LFP batteries. In 2020, Tesla introduced LFP batteries in its standard range Model 3s in China and dropped the starting price from 309,900 yuan ($48,080) to 249,900 yuan ($38,773). CEO Elon Musk has revealed that the improving energy density of LFP batteries now makes it possible to use the cheaper, cobalt-free batteries in its lower-end vehicles so as to free up more battery supply of lithium ion chemistry cells for Tesla's other models.
Up to now, intellectual property restrictions have kept LFP cells mostly within China. But Tesla is now able to deploy them in its pivotal U.S. market after it won approval from the Chinese government to start using LFP batteries in Chinese-made BEVs in 2020. Indeed, Tesla is making the switch to LFP mandatory in all its markets after a positive reception in the U.S.
In December 2020,Bloomberg NEF, a clean energy research that has been, among other things, tracking battery costs, announced that battery costs had dipped below the $100 per kWh threshold for the first time ever. The crucial milestone was achieved for battery packs designed for electric buses in China. In the EV industry, the $100 per kWh battery cost price point is generally regarded as the Holy Grail critical for the wider adoption of electric vehicles by making them cost-competitive at the sticker price, which remains an important psychological barrier for many potential buyers. The powertrain typically accounts for more than 70% of the cost of an EV.
Unfortunately, the mad lithium rally reversed this trend: last year, E Source estimated thatbattery cell prices will surge 22% from 2023 through 2026, peaking at $138 per kilowatt-hour thus reversing a multi-year trend whereby battery pack and EV costs have fallen consistently each year.
Thankfully, the lithium rally has lately come unstuck: after hitting an all-time high of CNY 595,000 per tonne ($86,170 per tonne) in November 2022, lithium carbonate prices in China have sunk to a 13-month low ofCNY 362,500 per tonne ($52,500 per tonne) in March 2023, good for a nearly 40% correction as a confluence of negative catalysts conspired to end lithium's biggest rally ever. Hopefully, battery costs will continue falling and help power the EV revolution.

 announced the investment last week, saying the Austin, Texas-based company had selected Mexico for its next ""gigafactory"" with plans to produce a ""next gen vehicle.""
 
Mexican officials have said the factory will be the world's biggest to produce electric vehicles, with investment worth $5 billion.
 
Subsequent phases of the plant could involve making components such as chips and

""That's why they bought a very large plot of land,"" he added.
 
The site in Santa Catarina, next to the state capital of Monterrey, spans several thousand acres, the local mayor said last week.
 
Garcia said the investment would act as an ""anchor"" attracting Tesla suppliers, and that the green light given to Tesla by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador — after the latter had expressed concerns over scarcity of water — sent a positive signal to other potential investors.
 
""It's like a kind of guide, that when they want to come set up here, it's very important they follow the law,"" he said, noting he had sent Lopez Obrador technical memos about the state's industrial water supply.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday it is launching a special crash-investigation team to probe the 
Feb. 18 crash 
involving a Tesla Model S and a ladder truck from the Contra Costa County fire department.
The firetruck probe is part of a larger investigation by the agency into multiple instances of Teslas using the automaker's Autopilot system crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.
The driver of the 2014 Tesla Model S was killed in the crash and a passenger critically injured. Four firefighters were treated for minor injuries, and the $1.4 million ladder truck was damaged.
NHTSA is investigating how the Autopilot system 
detects and responds to emergency vehicles
 parked on highways. At least 15 Teslas have crashed into emergency vehicles nationwide while using the system.
Authorities said the truck had its lights on and was parked diagonally on northbound lanes of Interstate 680 to protect responders to an earlier accident that did not result in injuries.
A NHTSA spokeswoman said she couldn't comment on an open investigation when asked if the Teslas are posing a danger to emergency workers.
NHTSA has been scrutinizing Teslas more intensely in the past year, seeking several recalls and opening investigations.
Earlier Wednesday, the agency posted documents revealing that it's investigating steering wheels that can detach from the steering column on as many as 120,000 Model Y SUVs.
The agency said it received two complaints in which 2023 Model Ys were delivered to customers with a missing bolt that holds the wheel to the steering column. A friction fit held the steering wheels on, but they separated when force was exerted while the SUVs were being driven.
The agency says in documents posted on its website Wednesday that both incidents happened while the SUVs had low mileage on them.
In one complaint filed with NHTSA, an owner said he was driving with his family on Route 1 in Woodbridge, New Jersey, when the steering wheel suddenly came off on Jan. 29, five days after the vehicle was purchased. The owner wrote that there were no cars behind him, and he was able to pull toward the road divider. There were no injuries.
It was a 'horrible experience,' the car's owner, Prerak Patel, told The Associated Press. He said he was in the freeway's left lane when the steering wheel came off and was lucky the road was straight and he was able to stop the car at the divider.
Messages were left seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has disbanded its media relations department.
At first a Tesla service center gave Patel a cost estimate of $103.96 to repair the problem. The service center apologized in what appear to be text messages posted on Twitter.
When Patel wrote that he had lost faith in Tesla and asked for a refund, the service center removed the charge and wrote that Tesla doesn't have a return policy, but he could reach out to the sales and delivery team.
Patel was later given the option of keeping the car or getting it replaced with a new one. Patel said he chose to get a replacement.
Patel said he's a fan of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and has invested a large chunk of his savings in the company's stock, which fell about 3% Wednesday.
'My kids were a little scared to ride in a loaner Tesla and, as a parent, we are able to restore their confidence,' Patel said. He said he hopes Tesla will investigate and improve its quality control 'so no other family experiences what we experienced.'
Detached steering wheels are rare in the auto industry, but not unprecedented. In February, Nissan recalled about 1,000 Ariya electric vehicles because the wheels could come off of the steering column due to a loose bolt.
In addition to the Autopilot investigation, NHTSA has opened investigations during the past three years into Teslas 
braking suddenly for no reason
, suspension problems and other issues.
In February, NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling 
nearly 363,000 vehicles with 'Full Self-Driving' software
 because the system can break traffic laws. The system, which cannot drive itself, is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners. But NHTSA said in documents that it can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to changes in posted speed limits.
The 
U.S. Justice Department also has asked Tesla
 for documents from Tesla about 'Full Self-Driving' and Autopilot.
Tesla says in its owners manual that neither Autopilot nor 'Full Self-Driving' can drive themselves, and that owners must be ready to intervene at all times.
NHTSA has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes in which automated systems are suspected of being used. Nineteen people have died in those crashes, 
including two motorcyclists.
Since January of 2022, Tesla has issued 20 recalls, including several that were required by NHTSA. The recalls include one from January of last year for 'Full Self-Driving' vehicles being programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds.

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has become an important method for growing graphene on copper substrates in order to obtain graphene samples of high quality and density. This paper mainly focuses on the fluid flow and transmission phenomenon in the reactor under different process operating conditions and reactor structures. Two macroscopic physical parameters that are established as important for CVD growth are temperature and pressure. Based on the special structure of a miniature T45-R Tesla valve acting as a CVD reactor structure, this study uses numerical simulation to determine the effect of the pressure field inside a Tesla valve on graphene synthesis and temperature variation on the graphene surface deposition rate. This macroscopic numerical modeling was compared to the existing straight tube model and found to improve the graphene surface deposition rate by two orders of magnitude when the 1290–1310 K reaction temperature range inside the Tesla valve was maintained and verified through the experiment. This study provides a reference basis for optimizing the reactor geometry design and the effects of changing the operating parameters on carbon deposition rates during a CVD reaction, and will furthermore benefit future research on the preparation of high-quality, large-area, and high-density graphene by CVD.

Tesla Model X
By Reuters
: Tesla Inc has cut prices on its two most expensive electric vehicles in the United States, according to the company's website, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said recent price cuts on other models had stoked demand.
The price cuts, Tesla's fifth adjustment since the start of the year, ranged from 4% on the performance version of the Model S to 9% on the more expensive Model X.
Musk has said repeatedly in recent months that Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.
""The desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high. The limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla,"" Musk said last week at Tesla's investor day.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the most recent price cuts.
Tesla slashed prices on its cars across all of its markets in January, offering discounts of up to 20% in what many analysts saw as the start of a price war by the electric vehicle market leader.
It has been adjusting prices since with a pace and frequency that goes beyond what established automakers have attempted in an industry where a car's base price is still referred to as a ""sticker price"" on a vehicle in inventory.
The Model S and Model X, which come in base all-wheel drive (AWD) and performance ""Plaid"" editions, represented about 4% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2022. Its two cheaper models, the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, made up the rest.
Tesla's website showed it had cut prices on both versions of its Model S by $5,000. The basic version of Model S was cut by 5% to $89,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4% to $109,990.
Prices of both the performance and basic variants of Model X cars were cut by $10,000, the electric vehicle maker's website showed. The price of the basic, AWD version of the Model X was cut by 9% to $99,990 while its performance Plaid version was cut by 8% to $109,990.
Tesla has a new version of the Model 3 codenamed ""Highland"" scheduled to go into production later this year and a change to the Model Y codenamed ""Juniper"" for next year, Reuters has reported.

On March 1, 2023, Mexico's President Andrés Lopéz Obrador confirmed an agreement with Tesla that allows the electric vehicle company to build the 'biggest electric vehicle plant in the world.'
[1]
 The plant, or 
maquiladora
, will be located in the border state of Nuevo León within the industrial hub of Monterrey, Mexico.'
[2]
 The plant will specifically be located in the Santa Catarina municipality. The agreement is governed by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), previously known as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Mexico-Tesla partnership was announced just 10 days after the Mexican president issued an executive order expediting the nationalization of the country's lithium reserves which placed the raw material under the management of Mexico's Secretaría de Energía.
[3]
 Lithium is an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. In 2018, Méxican geologists in Sonora discovered, potentially, the largest lithium deposits in the world. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk already has a partnership to mine some of Mexico's abundant lithium reserves in the Sonoran desert.


The recent developments appear to have mutual economic benefits for both Mexico and Tesla. However, several issues have come to the forefront as a result of the manufacturing agreement. For example, environmental concerns, the negative reputation of 
maquiladoras
 related to rampant violations of workers' rights, and Musk's support for the failed 'lithium coup' in Bolivia raise serious questions. Is the Mexico-Tesla agreement just another one-sided arrangement that favors U.S. corporations? Or, will the agreement have mutual benefits?


Tesla Joins Automakers in Mexico. What does Mexico gain?


Tesla joins a long list of automotive companies that already have plants in Mexico. The companies include: 'Audi, Baic Group, BMW, Stellantis, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jac by Giant Motors, Kia, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen.'
[4]
 These manufacturing plants make Mexico 'the world's seventh-largest automaker and fifth-largest exporter of cars and light trucks.'
[5]
 However, nearly all of the cars manufactured in Mexico are not sold to Mexican consumers. '90% of the cars' that are built in Mexico 'are exported, with 76% destined for the United States.'
[6]
 Tesla's electric vehicle plant in Nuevo León will only be about 400 miles away from Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas. Tesla is projected to produce 1 million electric vehicles per year at their new manufacturing center. Tesla purchased over 4,000 acres where construction will begin in just a few months.


What does Mexico really gain? The Monterrey region is expected to experience significant job growth. The Mexico-Tesla agreement includes an initial investment by Tesla of about $5 billion with the overall cost being 'a total of $10 billion.'
[7]
 The construction of the plant is expected to create thousands of jobs in northern Mexico. The Mayor of Santa Catarina, Jesus Nava, stated that 5,000 people will be hired during the initial stages of construction with a total of 10,000 jobs created by the end of construction.'
[8]
 In addition to job creation, Mexico seeks to play a leading role in the electric vehicle industry. Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard stated that 'it is a top priority to accelerate electromobility and the country's energy transition' to electric power.
[9]
 But at what cost to Mexico?


Tesla will Drastically Expand the 
Maquiladora
 Program in Mexico


Tesla's new manufacturing plant will contribute to the expansion of the 
maquiladoras
 in Mexico. A 
maquiladora 
is a manufacturing plant 'in Mexico with the parent company's administration facility' based 'in the United States. Maquiladoras allow companies to capitalize on the less expensive labor [production] in Mexico.'
[10]
 The plant also 'operates under preferential tariff programs established and administered by the United States and Mexico.'
[11]
 Initially through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which is now the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), corporations can take advantage of tariff-free imports. The tariff-free trade policies have historically benefitted large U.S. corporations. For example, tariff-free 
maquiladora
 factories produce 'cheaply assemble[d] products' that are 'export[ed] back into the United States.'
[12]
 The U.S. government is then able to generate tax revenue from its sales tax from consumer purchases. As mentioned, most of the goods are manufactured by U.S. companies in Mexico and then sold in U.S. markets. Put simply, U.S. corporations are able to secure higher profits from tariff-free policies while the U.S. government is able to generate tax revenue. After nearly all of the manufacturing is completed in Mexico, the Mexican government is unable to collect tax revenue from profits generated from the sale of the manufactured goods. Tax revenue would generally be used to fund public services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare.


The 
maquiladoras
 also have a long history of abuse and violations of workers' rights. There have been numerous high-profile reports of workdays lasting 12 hours or more, women being subjected to pregnancy tests when they apply for jobs, and widespread accusations of forced labor.
[13]
 It is also widely recognized that owners and managers of U.S. manufacturing plants have engaged in full-fledged anti-union campaigns. These campaigns have illegally prevented workers from improving their working conditions through collective bargaining agreements. The management practices at the 
maquiladoras
  have been a significant concern of workers' rights advocates for decades. With the impending arrival of Tesla's massive 
maquiladora
 in Mexico, new causes of concern will arise. In 2021, Tesla was found guilty of violating U.S. federal labor laws. The company illegally fired an employee, 'Richard Ortiz for protected union activity' and Musk was also found to have violated the National Labor Relations Act for intimidating workers by tweeting that if workers formed a union, they would have to give up their stock options.
[14]
 In February 2023, Tesla 'fired more than 30 supporters of a […] union at its Buffalo facility, just days after the organizing efforts were announced.'
[15]
 The workers have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. Advocates of worker rights are concerned that Tesla's engagement in open anti-union tactics will negatively contribute to the long history of workers' rights violations at 
maquiladoras
. In addition to worker issues, Tesla's 
maquiladora
 may cause further strain on Mexico's water resources.


Water Shortages in Nuevo León


Just weeks before the confirmation of the agreement between Mexico and Tesla, the Mexican President expressed concerns related to water scarcity in the State of Nuevo León. President Obrador stated, 'if there is no water, the permits will not be issued' because 'the problem is that any big investment brings more population, more services, more water, roads, sewers, and public transportation.'
[16]
 The President had previously denied permits to brewery companies due to water shortages. Throughout 2022, Nuevo León faced an 'acute water shortage' which resulted in the state rationing and restricting water usage by 'water-intensive industries.''
[17]
 Tesla has responded to the water concerns by assuring Mexican officials that the company will rely on minimal water, recycled water, and the capturing of rain water. Despite Tesla's assurances, U.S. manufacturing plants have been found to misuse Mexico's water resources, pollute streams, leaving Mexican citizens with limited access to clean water. Given that Tesla's plant will be the largest facility in the region, further strains on Mexico's water resources can be expected. These activities may result in further water shortages in Nuevo León. Tesla's current presence in Mexico has already caused severe environmental issues about 1,000 miles west of Nuevo León, in the lithium-rich State of Sonora.




Tesla's Lithium Mining in Sonora


Tesla's electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by electricity that is stored in rechargeable batteries. The EV batteries are composed of metals such as cobalt, nickel, and, most importantly, lithium. In 2018, the Mexican Geological Service detected new lithium deposits in the State of Sonora with 'reserves estimated at 243.8 million tons.'
[18]
 Lithium is the primary metal used to manufacture rechargeable batteries which are used in Tesla's electric vehicles, among other technologies. The lithium in Sonora is already being 'exploited by Bacanora Lithium company and Mexital Mining' which is a joint partnership with Tesla.
[19]
 The lithium mining has caused severe environmental issues that violate the provisions under the Sonora River Trust.


Alfonso Durazo, Governor of Sonora, 'mentioned that a work team is preparing to resolve the commitments not met by Sonora River Trust to the population of Cananea and the surrounding towns that have suffered damage to their health, development and economy, after the spill of toxic acids caused by the […] mining consortium.'
[20]
 Several workers at the mines have also died due to hazardous working conditions. Tesla's lithium mining activities have already contributed to the toxification of the Sonoran River. Is it expected for the degradation of the environment to continue under Tesla's new agreement? Overall, given the concerns related to the environment and labor standards, the biggest concern may be Elon Musk's proven support for the destabilization of Bolivian society.


Elon Musk's Support for the Bolivian 'Lithium Coup'


In 2020, Elon Musk admitted to being involved in the 2019 'Lithium Coup' in Bolivia. The coup forced President Evo Morales out of office causing him to seek exile in Mexico after he was threatened with police and military violence. The coup was in response to the Bolivian President's nationalization efforts to fully control and protect their lithium resources from foreign control. In 'response to an accusation on twitter that the U.S. government organized a coup against President Evo Morales so that Musk could obtain Bolivia's lithium,' Musk responded by tweeting, 'We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.'
[21]
 The coup caused severe political and social instability in Bolivia which brought the country on the verge of civil war.


Bolivia is recognized as the country with the largest lithium reserves in the world. Bolivia is estimated to have '21 million tonnes' and 'holds about one quarter of the entire global resource' – including the world's single-biggest lithium deposit, the Salar de Uyuni salt flat.'
[22]
 Bolivia is one of three Latin American countries of the 'lithium triangle.' Argentina and Chile are known to have 17 million tonnes and 9 million tonnes, respectively. The 'lithium triangle' comprises more than half of the world's lithium. It is clear why Musk would want to have unrestrained access to Bolivia's lithium resources even if it caused instability within Bolivian society.


Conclusion


Is the Mexico-Tesla agreement just another one-sided arrangement that favors U.S. corporations? Or, will the agreement have mutual benefits? The México-Tesla agreement will result in the construction of the largest electric vehicle manufacturing plant in the world. Tesla will invest billions of dollars, creating thousands of jobs for Mexican workers. Tesla will be able to produce 1 million more electric vehicles per year. However, given the unfortunate history of 
maquiladoras 
in Mexico, in addition to Tesla's track record of anti-union activities, as well as Tesla's current practices at Mexico lithium mines, Tesla's soon-to-be plant in Nuevo León raises serious concerns to workers and the environment. Also, the USMCA, previously known as NAFTA, has shown to primarily benefit U.S. corporations. Most concerning is that Elon Musk has supported the overthrow of a Latin American government, which many Latin Americans view as a violation of international law.


Only time will tell if the Mexico-Tesla agreement will mutually benefit both parties or if it is just another one-sided arrangement.

models, it's
 fairly easy to walk up to the wrong car in the supermarket parking lot, but the mix-up usually ends there. Your key fob won't unlock the car, and you eventually see someone else's junk inside before looking for the right car. One Canadian 
Tesla Model 3
 owner got a little mixed up and was able to drive off in a car that wasn't his.
 
Rajesh Randev told 
Global News
 that a stranger's 
Tesla
 was parked next to his and was the same model and 
color
 as his own. Reality started sinking in a few miles down the road when Randev noticed the windshield of the Tesla he was driving was cracked. He called his wife, who said she had no knowledge of the windshield issue, and shortly after, the actual owner of the Tesla texted him.
 
Randev pulled over and inspected the car he was driving, finding it had different wheels than his. Interestingly, he got 
back
 into the car and drove it to pick up his kids before returning to the owner, who said they saw his phone number on a piece of paper in his car. Both parties got a laugh out of the situation, and Randev called the police, but they are not pursuing the matter since nothing happened.
 
'Worrying' is an excellent word to use for this situation, because it did not involve hackers or bad actors of any kind. That a random person could drive away with a car and ride around town without any warning signs in the car or otherwise is a matter of concern. Also worrying is 
Tesla's response
, which so far has been nonexistent.
 
Randev has called the automaker and submitted video evidence, but some emails bounced back, and he has received no response. The company's inbox seems to be full, and CEO 
Elon Musk
 famously cut Tesla's public relations team, so it appears there's little recourse for some owners with basic support needs.",autoblog.com,1835,business,GB,en,Chris Teague,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2982x1677+0+483/resize/800x450!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/572f9230-5ad6-11ed-b6ff-5c082e128874,False,@therealautoblog,8.312208,092c6042a77da4e900b7e065c2b9bd16
305,Volkswagen supercharges EV drive with £160bn to see off Tesla and Chinese rivals,Howard Mustoe,2023-03-14 00:00:00,date,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/03/14/volkswagen-supercharges-ev-drive-160bn-see-tesla-chinese-rivals/,telegraph.co.uk,Move comes as EV makers look to expand their offering to the mass market,"The company is planning to release a cheaper electric car in 2025 which costs about €25,000, a price comparable with a petrol-fuelled Golf.
Car makers are
 battling to bring down the cost
 of electric cars in order to tempt buyers with tighter budgets.
The majority of UK Tesla owners are high earners who have used generous tax breaks to buy the cars. A scheme offering a steep discount for those in the 40pc and 45pc income tax brackets can halve the effective cost of an EV in some instances.
But government incentives are being pared back and car makers are expected to begin lowering prices, else risk a slower pace of adoption.
VW said its bestselling EV was its pricier ID.4 model, which starts at £38,100 in the UK, followed by the £36,400 ID.3.
To gain broader acceptance, EVs will have to be priced similarly to combustion-powered units since the cheaper running cost they offer per mile will not appeal to lighter users.
Tesla itself has trimmed the price of a basic Model Y by 6pc to £44,320 earlier this month, while the lowest-spec Model 3 was also down 6pc, at £40,470. 
That came after a steep discount in January, when the Californian company cut price tags by up to £8,000 in the UK, making some cheaper models comparable to affordable brands such as Skoda and Kia.
The lower prices come ahead of an expected 
influx of cheaper models from China
. Up to 30 new EV brands are eyeing up the UK market, according to an industry report seen by The Telegraph in January, with most of those Chinese.
Companies like BYD and Ora, which already have agreements in place with UK dealers, will be joined by a raft of other car makers including Chery, Dongfeng and Haval.
Ora's Funky Cat EV starts at £32,000 and the BYD Atto 3 is priced from £36,500.",telegraph.co.uk,123,business,GB,en,"Chris Price,Eir Nolsøe,Gareth Corfield,Howard Mustoe,James Titcomb,Melissa Lawford",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2023/03/14/TELEMMGLPICT000327252757_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdGLvJF5WfpqnBZShRL_tOZw.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,False,,7.435264,2f3d225a692c9ed8f670c1286e25abe0

 in front of a 
Tesla

Elon Musk's plan to build another factory in Mexico will be key in Tesla's bid to provide the masses with a $25,000 car, according to automotive manufacturing expert Sandy Munro.
 
Tesla shared 
plans for a new factory in Mexico
 that would supplement existing Tesla assembly at the company's investor day earlier this month
 
""The Mexican plant is a genius move,"" Munro, a manufacturing expert known for his vehicle teardowns, said in a 
YouTube video posted Tuesday
. ""We've done studies that found in some places – and some situations – Mexico is cheaper than 
China
.""
 
An assembly plant in Mexico, where workers are typically paid less than in the US, makes the most sense for achieving a $25,000 Tesla, Munro said, something that's long been a goal of Musk. 
 
""Why go to China if you can get to Mexico?"" he said.
 
Many car companies have increased their manufacturing presence in Mexico in the last two decades in pursuit of lower labor costs, as well as benefits of free trade agreements in North America, and lower shipping costs than overseas manufacturing operations. Some of the industry's most profitable vehicles are built in Mexico, including some 
General Motors
 pickup trucks and heavy-duty 
Ram pickups
.
 
Musk first teased the idea of a sub-$30,000 
Tesla in 2020
. At the time, he said the affordable price point would be achieved through a 50% reduction in cost for 
battery
 and cell manufacturing. That car is supposed to come out this year if the company is on track with those original plans. 
 
Investors expected to see a preview of this new, affordable Tesla at 
the company's March 1 Investor Day
, but were disappointed when executives shared manufacturing cost-savings efforts but failed to unveil the new model that would benefit from these changes.
 
How Tesla plans to cut manufacturing costs
 
Tesla's lead designer and vice president of vehicle engineering shared a series of cost-saving manufacturing changes the electric-vehicle maker has in store for the year ahead at the company's investor day. 
 
These plans include rethinking the assembly line in a way that allows more people and 
robots
 to work on a vehicle at the same time and reducing factory footprint by more than 40%. Overall, Tesla is targeting a 50% reduction in manufacturing costs.
 
It's all part of Musk and 
Tesla's plan to sell more than 20 million cars
 by the end of the decade – a target that some have said is too lofty and hinges on major changes in battery tech.
 
But Munro said he isn't ready to bet against Musk just yet
 
""Every time someone opens their mouth and says 'that can't happen,' Elon shows up"" to prove them wrong, he said. ""If you want to be a naysayer, go ahead … At the end of the day you're always going to lose especially if you're betting against Elon Musk.""

307,Tesla opening Superchargers to rivals leaves some owners worried about waiting in line behind Fords and Kias,Insider,2023-03-16 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/03/16/tesla-opening-its-exclusive-superchargers-to-rivals-leaves-some-owners-worried-about-waiting-in-line-behind-fords-and-kias/,autoblog.com,"Until now, you had to own a Tesla to use one of the company's charging stations. Some owners are frustrated that that exclusivity is going away.","Tesla
 owners love the exclusive Supercharger network. Now some are frustrated that Tesla is expanding access to other cars. 
Lucy Nicholson/Reuters
 
 
 
For Nelson Jackson, a big reason for 
buying a Tesla Model S
 was the company's extensive charging network, which takes some of the headaches out of being an early electric-vehicle adopter. 
 
Now that 
Elon Musk's automaker is opening up some of its formerly exclusive Superchargers
 to drivers of other' EVs, Jackson told Insider he feels betrayed. He paid a premium for a Tesla specifically because of its roadside fast-chargers, which are known for being 
more reliable, widespread, and convenient
 than the public plugs that other EV owners rely on.
 
Now he fears that crucial advantage will disappear, leaving him waiting to charge behind all sorts of 
Fords
, 
Kias
, and 
Chevrolets
. 
 
""It's just a disaster on so many levels,"" he said. ""I don't think they thought this through.""
 
Tesa did not respond to a request for comment. 
 
As part of 
Joe Biden's
 plan to shore up the nation's charging infrastructure, the White House in February announced that 
Tesla would open up 3,500 new and existing Superchargers
 for public use by the end of 2024. Previously, all 
18,000 Superchargers in the US
 used Tesla's proprietary charging plug and were off-limits to rival automakers, giving Tesla owners peace of mind on 
road trips
 that the rest of the EV community longed for.
 
Tesla devotees like Jackson are wondering how long that enviable position will last. 
 
 
 
 Tesla operates the largest network of fast-chargers in the US. 
Associated Press
 
 
 
Jackson already encounters lines at Supercharger locations around holiday travel periods and says that more vehicles charging simultaneously at a station slows down refueling times. Since charging already takes so much longer than getting gas, he worries that an influx of non-Tesla cars could render Supercharging too inconvenient to bear.
 
On top of it all, he says, there's the problem of non-Teslas clogging multiple charging stalls; because their charging ports aren't situated in the same spot as on a Tesla, they've 
had to park creatively
 at the few Supercharger stations that have already opened up access. 
 
Eric Hosmer, a dump 
truck
 driver in Maryland who has put well over 200,000 miles on his 2013 
Model S
, shares some of those trepidations. He believes the Tesla charging experience is so far ahead of the competition that non-Tesla owners will arrive in droves. 
 
Helen Matthews, a 
Model Y
 owner in Philadelphia, said she was initially outraged by the news, given the already-high demand for Supercharger stalls. But ultimately, she thinks Tesla making it easier to own a clean vehicle is good for the planet. Still, she has concerns about how the change will impact her family's trips. 
 
Other Tesla owners Insider spoke with don't foresee major issues and cheer a move that could accelerate EV adoption. Day Veerlapati, an IT executive who owns a 
Model 3
 and a Model Y, hopes the increased competition will pressure other charging networks to improve the quality of their service. 
 
 
 
 Experts said Tesla Superchargers could get more crowded, but there probably won't be major issues. 
PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images
 
 
 
According to Brent Gruber, executive director of the EV practice at JD Power, it's not clear yet how Tesla drivers will be impacted. But charging infrastructure on the whole isn't keeping up with EV sales, he said, and Tesla's decision could lead to crowding at its stations. 
 
""Adoption and demand is growing at a rate that is twice as fast as public 
charger
 installation growth in the United States, so there's an imbalance there to begin with,"" he said. 
 
The move will allow Tesla to apply for some of the $7.5 billion in funding that the Biden Administration has set aside for improving EV charging. The funds are reserved for stations that any vehicles can use. 
 
Loren McDonald, CEO of EV industry consultancy EVAdoption, said that while non-Teslas charging up could inconvenience Tesla owners during holiday travel periods, he doesn't expect widespread hiccups. Tesla gathers so much data from its vehicles and charging stations that it can deploy public-use plugs smartly. 
 
""They're not going to be dumb and add these where there are already wait times. They're going to put them in at locations that are underutilized,"" he said.
 
If the Supercharging experience deteriorates significantly, Jackson may get rid of his beloved Tesla. He might even go back to gas. 
 
""I'm certainly not going to ride around in a $100,000 Model S if I can't charge,"" he said.

Ram Charan, who was a guest at the India Today Conclave 2023 on Day 1, spoke about why he and Jr NTR did not perform Naatu Naatu on the Oscars stage
. He said, ""I was ready. I was 100 percent ready to get that call. But I don't know what happened. The trope did a better job than us. We have done that for so many interviews. It is now time for us to relax.""

YouTube channel
, where his earnest, no frills, in-depth, and entertaining 
car reviews
 have afforded him a legion of fans. DeMuro's channel has over 4.6 million subscribers to date and his more popular videos garner millions of views each.
 
DeMuro's internet stardom hasn't kept him from shunning other pursuits, as he dipped his toe into the startup world with his 
auction
 site 
Cars & Bids
, which focuses on 
classic cars
 from the modern era (typically the ‘80s and up).
 
Cars & Bids isn't the first site focusing on car enthusiasts, but it has gained traction even in the face of steep competition from bigger auction sites like 
Bringatrailer.com
. Its popularity led to new funding for expanding the business, with a big $37 million infusion coming from PE firm The Chernin Group.
 
It wasn't all smooth sailing though, at least at the start.
 
'It's been harder than I expected, to be totally honest. I always tell people, if I had known it was going to be this difficult to run a business like this, I would have just started a podcast,' DeMuro joked during an interview with Yahoo Finance. 'Of course we launched this business in June of 2020, we thought it was going to fail because it was COVID. But, actually, we launched into the greatest car market in the 
history of the automobile
 — so it all worked out okay.'
 
Even in an era of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, and 
general
 economic unease, DuMuro said the 
used car
 market has done better than feared.
 
'Obviously, things have slowed down from their very peak, which felt to me like the end of '21, beginning of '22, maybe the spring of '22,' DeMuro said, noting demand is still stronger than he was expecting.
 
'I was thinking, as interest rates were rising throughout '22, cars would really start to slow down, people would start to maybe pull back on their purchases of these things. That hasn't really happened as much as I thought. Good stuff is still bringing good money,' he says.
 
Even in-person events, such as the big auctions taking place at the 
Amelia Island Concours
 over the weekend, jibe with DeMuro's observations, with auction houses 
seeing record sales
. And Cars & Bids is just riding the wave of high interest in classic and older cars, with Americans at least willing to spend some money to enjoy the car of their dreams, instead of just dreaming about it.
 
Electrification and why ‘analog' cars matter
 
Cars & Bids has many cars on the virtual offer-block, even newer EVs from 
Rivian
 (
RIVN
), 
Lucid
 (
LCID
), and 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
). As a longtime watcher of the car market, and one who's tested hundreds of vehicles from classic muscle cars to EVs, DeMuro has some thoughts on electrification, especially Tesla and where the brand sits right now.
 
'When Tesla first came out with the 
Model S
 10 years ago— believe it or not, it's been over 10 years ago, now— it was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla. There was no possible way to catch up to Tesla; and in the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up,' he says.
 
Tesla hasn't come out with anything new or exciting recently, DeMuro says, and he suggests the company's competitive advantage has 'eroded fairly considerably.' Tesla's CyberTruck is late, he says, and others like Rivian, 
Ford
, have already jumped into the EV pickup wars.
 
In DeMuro's view, old stalwarts like Ford and 
GM
 are the most likely to catch and bring it to Tesla on the EV battlefield. 'When you look at the 
Ford Mustang Mach-E
, to me, that is a very competitive car with the 
Model Y
. I think that 
General Motors
 and Ford are very committed to an 
electric vehicle
 strategy that is going to make them continually banging at Tesla's door over the next few years.'
 
The electric race is on, and while Wall Street believes Tesla's tech and software are still ahead, it seems the traditional competition is making a go of it - and DeMuro seems to think it might be better to bet on Detroit.
 
However when shifting back to enthusiast cars, which are DeMuro's speciality, he declined to place any 'bets' on specific older cars that he expects to rise in value. It's too tricky he says given how volatile the market is, though he did say one class of cars will stand out from the rest.
 
'One segment that I will remain bullish on until probably years to come - analog cars,' DeMuro says. 'As the world moves to electric vehicles, which I think are great for most people for daily transportation, I do think there's going to be a huge segment of the enthusiast world that's going to wish to have cars with manual transmissions, cars that have a big engine sound, cars that still feel like the old days - and I think analog cars that have those qualities are still going to continue to be desirable.'
 
If anyone knows, it would be DeMuro. Now only if he had any advice on where to get a cheap 
2009 Chevrolet Corvette
 Z06…

WHY ROSEN LAW: 
We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. 
Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.
 Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over 
$438 million
 for investors. In 2020, founding partner 
Laurence Rosen
 was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: 
According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants had overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (""FSD"") technologies; (2) Tesla's Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Tesla was subjected to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; (4) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

316,We charged a non-Tesla at a Supercharger. Here's how it went,Zac Palmer,2023-03-27 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/03/27/charging-a-non-tesla-on-a-tesla-supercharger-long-term-kia-ev6/,autoblog.com,We took our long-term 2022 Kia EV6 to a Tesla Supercharger in New York to see what it's like.,"FREDONIA, N.Y. — 
Tesla
 
opened up a small part of its Supercharger network
 to non-Tesla vehicles a couple of weeks ago, and as soon as the news hit, we downloaded the Tesla app and tried to find a compatible 
charger
 near our editors in Detroit and Los Angeles. First mistake! There were no Superchargers open to non-Teslas in the greater Los Angeles area nor the entire state of Michigan at the time of this article's publishing. The closest compatible charger was in … Fredonia, N.Y.
 
That's approximately a five-hour drive from home, so we put in motion plans to get there and try it out. The steed? 
Our long-term  GT-Line
. It's already 
proven to be a spectacular electric road trip companion
, offering up fast charge speeds and a respectable range between charges.
 
The prep work to charge a non-Tesla at a Supercharger is similar to that of many electric charging apps like Electrify America or EVGo. Download the app, make an account and enter in a credit card. Tesla makes getting going easy with clear prompts in the app, and it's a seriously slick and fast app at that.
 
 
Arriving at a compatible Tesla Supercharger location is when things are likely to go sideways. The first problem is simple parking logistics. Tesla designed its chargers to work with the charge port location of Tesla vehicles, which is on the driver-side rear quarter panel adjacent to the taillights. The cords were only ever made long enough for a Tesla to back into a spot and safely reach this location. By our estimation, you're likely to struggle unless your non-Tesla EV shares the Tesla's charge point location (
Polestar 2
 and 
Hummer EV
), is located at the very front of the car (
Kia Niro EV
, 
Hyundai Kona EV
) or maybe the front passenger side (
Porsche Taycan
 and 
Audi E-Tron GT
). That's not many cars; most other EVs have a different location.  
 
For example, the 
Ford F-150 Lightning
 and 
Mustang Mach-E
, 
Cadillac Lyriq
, 
Rivian R1S
 and 
R1T
, and 
Lucid Air
 all have theirs on the driver side, but at the front – the cord definitely won't reach if you back them in, and there's a good chance you'll bump into the charger's concrete bollards should you try to inch close enough going forward.
 
 
Our 
EV6
 has the other common location, on the passenger-side rear, which presents a slightly different issue. Parked side-by-side with another Tesla, the two of you will end up fighting for the same plug. Practically speaking, us being plugged in on the 'wrong side' with our EV6 makes one of the charging spaces useless for a Tesla owner who may come along. Unless there are lots of open spots, this sure seems inconsiderate, and we don't encourage it. Queue the angry social media posts in 3, 2, 1 …
 
Once you get the logistics of the situation sorted, beginning a charge session is simple and done 100% through the app. Just pull up the Supercharger station you're at within the Tesla app, tap on the specific charger you're going to plug into (they're clearly labeled by number and letter), and then tap the big blue button that says 'unlock adapter.' This unlocks the 'Magic Dock' that Tesla has installed at these charger stations. The Magic Dock is necessary because it contains the adapter from Tesla's J1772 connector to the CCS (Combined Charging System) connector used by the EV6 and most other EVs — this is why only certain locations are available now, because Tesla needs to install Magic Docks everywhere it intends to allow non-Teslas to charge. It only takes a second after hitting this button for the adapter to unlock, and once it's done so, you go grab the connector, push in, and the charger with the CCS adapter falls out. After that, it's as easy as plugging in your car. Tesla says that it could take as much as two minutes for charging to begin, but it only took about 5-10 seconds in our experience.
 
Once you're done charging, you go back into the Tesla app and tap 'stop charging.' You can then unplug and put the Magic Dock back where you found it. We charged our EV6 at this particular location on two separate occasions, and the starting/ending process was utterly seamless without a single hiccup.
 
 
Top right: charging performance at Supercharger; Bottom right: charging performance at Electrify America charger
 
However! There's one (very big) problem with charging 
some
 non-Tesla EVs on Tesla Superchargers: charge speed. The maximum charge speed we saw on both occasions charging our EV6 was 42 kW, which is a far cry from the 235 kW speeds our EV6 is capable of. Why is the EV6 so slow on the Tesla Supercharger? It comes down to the electrical architecture of the car. The EV6 (and every other E-GMP platform car from 
Hyundai
) employs an 800-volt electrical architecture that is designed to be fast-charged with 800-volt chargers. The 
Porsche Taycan
, Rivian R1T/R1S and a few others can do the same. Meanwhile, Teslas all use a 400-volt electrical architecture and Tesla Superchargers are 400-volt chargers. In optimum conditions, the same charger that our EV6 could only pull 42 kW from could charge a Tesla at up to 250 kW.
 
Another 800-volt EV that is designed to accept 400-volt chargers is the GMC 
Hummer
 EV, which 
GM
 says is designed to support 400-volt charging infrastructure without a converter box or accessories. We've yet to test a Hummer on a Supercharger, though, so its ultimate charge performance remains to be seen.
 
We asked 
Kia
 about this charging conundrum and received the following in return. 'Kia is aware of some issues with the EV6 charging on Tesla Superchargers and is working to resolve the issue.'
 
 
The ultimate conclusion we can come to here is that Tesla opening up its Supercharger network is a boon for only 
some
 EV owners. Instead of waiting around an hour-plus for the Supercharger to charge our EV6, we popped over to the Electrify America across the street and instantly pulled 
230
 kW charge speeds. It went from 10-80% in just 20 minutes. That's infinitely more appealing than wasting a couple of hours waiting on slow charging. Now that we know the reality of charging our EV6 — a reality that almost certainly applies to platform mates like the 
Hyundai Ioniq 5
 and 
Genesis GV60
, too — on a Tesla Supercharger, there's a good chance we won't be going back.
 
For those with EVs that 
are
 better equipped to charge on Superchargers, the rollout of additional open stations will be a huge plus to the ownership experience. Outside of cars that utilize 
Plug-and-Charge technology
, the Tesla Supercharger experience with non-Teslas is both faster and easier than plugging in anywhere else. Plus, Superchargers have proven to be far more reliable than the often-broken Electrify America or EVGo network sprawled across the country. Given a compatible vehicle and the choice between a Supercharger or other charger, sign us up for the Supercharger every time.

317,Northbrook village board approves incentive agreement for Tesla dealership,Dave Oberhelman,2023-03-29 00:00:00,date,https://www.dailyherald.com/business/20230329/northbrook-village-board-approves-incentive-agreement-for-tesla-dealership,dailyherald.com,Northbrook's village board approved zoning and an economic incentive agreement for a Tesla automobile dealership at 1000-1200 Skokie Blvd.,"Possibly as soon as next year, Northbrook residents may have a convenient location to buy a new Tesla.
 
Construction should start this fall with a goal to open up a 48,000-square-foot sales, service and delivery center by 2024, Village President Kathryn Ciesla said at the board's March 14 meeting.
 
Northbrook's village board approved zoning and an economic incentive agreement for a Tesla automobile dealership at 1200 Skokie Blvd.
 
A topic long-discussed, at the meeting trustees approved the zoning considerations on consent and a resolution for the agreement by a 4-0 vote. Trustees Johannah Hebl and Muriel Collison were absent for the vote.
 
Village Attorney Steve Elrod said the agreement was ""very protective of the village.""
 
Elrod said Tesla will spend about $25 million to buy the property, develop it and build the dealership. Tesla seeks a total incentive from Northbrook of $1.6 million.
 
Part of the protection is that incentives to the developer won't be provided until Tesla is up and running and the village starts receiving sales taxes.
 
""Importantly, this is not a general debt obligation of the village,"" Elrod said. ""The village's obligation to pay the incentive kicks in only if sales tax is received. And, finally, there is no impact on the property tax that will be received by the village and all of the other taxing districts.""
 
 
 
 
by signing up you agree to our 
terms of service
 
 
 
 
For every $640,000 the village receives in sales tax revenue, it will rebate $320,000 up to a total of $1.6 million. Should the village receive $1,280,000 of sales taxes in one year, it will then pay the developer $640,000.
 
""It's nothing that we haven't seen before, this is just structured somewhat differently to address the development costs,"" Trustee Bob Israel said of the incentive agreement.
 
Elrod said Tesla's development team was ""extremely cooperative,"" in meetings with the municipality.
 
""This is the option they favored,"" Ciesla said, ""so we're very happy to work with you on this, and we could not be more excited for you to come into the community.""",dailyherald.com,2869,news,US,en,Dave Oberhelman,https://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20230329/BUSINESS/230329208/AR/0/AR-230329208.jpg&updated=202303291243&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder,False,@dailyherald,7.934873,2d5a5c2343edaa152f27555fedb160bb

Ragnarok Origin Announces Tesla Giveaway Winner and Major Updates.
(PRNewswire)

The massive March updates have brought several new additions to Ragnarok Origin including the new Rogue and Stalker job classes, highly requested PVE content, and a new server 'Poporing' is now available for new users to progress comfortably with a fresh setting.
The Rogue and Stalker are familiar Thief class progressions from the original Ragnarok IP that players may recognize. Compared to Thieves, Rogues are more skilled with the bow and arrow, and have enhanced knife skills. Stalkers, the advanced class from Rogues, are trackers who are impossible to escape from and can eliminate their targets in the blink of an eye.
Last but not least, exciting new PVE content has also been introduced. The Fantasy Land of Memories is a 5-party dungeon where players can test their battle abilities to the fullest. The 20-floor dungeon will be renewed for a new season every 5 weeks, giving plenty of time for players to challenge themselves with a rising difficulty level.
Players can experience the new updates and play Ragnarok Origin on mobile devices for free. For more details about the Dream Giveaway, check out the official event page at

yet another investigation into problems with Teslas
, this time tied to complaints that the seat belts may not hold people in a crash.
The investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers an estimated 50,000 Model X SUVs from the 2022 and 2023 model years.
The agency says it has two complaints from Tesla owners that the front belts weren't sufficiently connected at the factory.
Documents posted by the agency Tuesday say the belt linkage and pretensioners, which tighten the belts before a crash, are anchored to the seat frames.
Both complaints allege that the linkage and pretensioner separated from the frames when the vehicles were driving and force was exerted. Neither incident involved a crash.
The agency says it's opening the probe to look into Tesla's manufacturing processes, how often the problem happens and how widespread it is. Investigations can lead to recalls.
A message was left early Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.
NHTSA also is investigating complaints about problems with Teslas that date to 2020. The probes include Teslas with partially automated driving systems that can 
brake for no reason
 or can
 run into emergency vehicles
 parked on highways.
There also are investigations into complaints that some steering wheels can suddenly disconnect and that suspension parts can fail.

We introduce a new electroencephalogram (EEG) net, which will allow clinicians to monitor EEG while tracking head motion. Motion during MRI limits patient scans, especially of children with epilepsy. EEG is also severely affected by motion-induced noise, predominantly ballistocardiogram (BCG) noise due to the heartbeat. Methods: The MotoNet was built using polymer thick film (PTF) EEG leads and motion sensors on opposite sides in the same flex circuit. EEG/motion measurements were made with a standard commercial EEG acquisition system in a 3 Tesla (T) MRI. A Kalman filtering-based BCG correction tool was used to clean the EEG in healthy volunteers. Results: MRI safety studies in 3 T confirmed the maximum heating below 1 °C. Using an MRI sequence with spatial localization gradients only, the position of the head was linearly correlated with the average motion sensor output. Kalman filtering was shown to reduce the BCG noise and recover artifact-clean EEG. Conclusions: The MotoNet is an innovative EEG net design that co-locates 32 EEG electrodes with 32 motion sensors to improve both EEG and MRI signal quality. In combination with custom gradients, the position of the net can, in principle, be determined. In addition, the motion sensors can help reduce BCG noise.

This paper is designed to explicate and analyze data acquired from experimental field tests of a Tesla Model 3 lane correction module within the vehicle's Autopilot Suite, a component of Tesla OS. The initial problem was discovered during a nominal drive of the Tesla Model 3, where after a random number of lane correction events, the lane correction module shuts down, issues a visual disable warning on the touchscreen, and control of the vehicle is given to the driver until the next drive. That development was considered problematic, as the driver can be caught off guard or may be medically disabled and unable to respond. During a controlled stress test, a more severe issue was discovered. After a random number of lane correction events, the lane correction module shuts down without warning, then stays activated after the test driver corrects the vehicle's trajectory. This is considered a fatal error in the system and adds a dangerous element to an otherwise standard feature in a modern automotive vehicle. The results established that the number of events needed to trigger a fatal error without warning is unpredictable. Our results also demonstrate that the system is inconsistent.

Elon Musk broke federal labor laws when he threatened to strip stock options from employees if they unionized, an appeals court has ruled.
 
The 5th Circuit US Court of Appeals 
upheld
 a previous ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that found Musk had made unlawful threats pertaining to employee remuneration.
 
The charge came in response to 
a 2018 tweet
 when Musk responded to a user who asked him about his views of unions. The action was brought by the 
United Auto Workers
 after staff tried to unionize at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. 
 
""Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was 
UAW
 & everybody already gets healthcare,"" Musk tweeted.
 
Tesla argued that because Musk said there was nothing stopping Tesla workers joining a union, it couldn't be regarded as a threat.
 
However, the 5th Circuit court sided with the NLRB's initial ruling. 
 
""Because stock options are part of Tesla's employees' compensation, and nothing in the tweet suggested that Tesla would be forced to end stock options or that the UAW would be the cause of giving up stock options, substantial evidence supports the NLRB's conclusion that the tweet is as an implied threat to end stock options as retaliation for unionization,"" the panel wrote in its conclusion.
 
The New Orleans-based court also ordered Musk to delete the tweet, 
Reuters reported
.
 
The court also upheld an order that Tesla should reinstate Richard Ortiz, a worker who was fired after organizing a 
union drive at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California
. He will receive backpay following his unlawful dismissal.
 
Shawn Fain, the UAW's president, welcomed the rulings but 
said
: ""Here is a company that clearly broke the law and yet it is several years down the road before these workers have achieved a modicum of justice.""
 
The 
NLRB previously ruled against Tesla last year
 when the carmaker prevented employees from wearing clothes bearing union insignia. 
 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours.

Motorists drive past Tesla's primary vehicle factory in Fremont, California, US.
By Reuters
: A trial kicked off in San Francisco federal court on Monday to determine how much money Tesla Inc must pay to a Black elevator operator whom a jury determined was subjected to severe racial harassment while working at the electric auto maker's flagship assembly plant.
A lawyer for plaintiff Owen Diaz told a jury during opening statements that the racist slurs, graffiti and threats his client faced were part of a ""plantation mentality"" at the Fremont, California factory where Black workers were treated as second-class citizens.
""You will conclude that Tesla's conduct ... is a conscious decision not to protect African American employees inside their workplace,"" the lawyer, Bernard Alexander, said.
The trial is scheduled to last five days. Last year, a judge slashed the $137 million verdict that a different jury awarded in 2021 to Diaz, one of the largest ever in a US workplace discrimination case, to $15 million. Diaz's lawyers rejected the lower payout and opted for a new trial on damages.
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Tesla, told the jury that any racist conduct at the plant was indefensible. But he suggested that Diaz was exaggerating his claims and could not prove that he suffered psychological damage warranting money damages.
""There is almost no evidence of anything you just heard other than a lawyer saying it happened eight years later,"" Spiro said.

As at the last trial, Diaz and several employees and managers at the Fremont plant are expected to testify.
In his 2017 lawsuit, Diaz accused Tesla of failing to act when he complained to managers in 2015 that employees at the factory frequently used racist slurs and scrawled swastikas, racist caricatures and epithets on walls and workstations.
Diaz sued Tesla for causing him emotional distress under a California law prohibiting employers from failing to prevent hostile work environments based on race and other protected traits.
The jury in 2021 awarded Diaz nearly $7 million in compensatory damages for emotional distress, and $130 million in punitive damages, designed to punish unlawful conduct and deter it in the future.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick last year reduced the compensatory damages to $1.5 million and the punitive damages to $13.5 million. He said that sum acknowledged the pervasive harassment Diaz faced while reflecting that he had worked at the factory for only nine months and had not alleged any physical injury or illness.
Employment discrimination cases rarely yield verdicts of more than $1 million, let alone nine-figure sums. The U.S. Supreme Court has said punitive damages typically should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages.

Tesla also faces claims of tolerating widespread race bias at the Fremont plant in a class action in California state court and a separate lawsuit by the state's civil rights watchdog making similar allegations. Both cases are still in early stages.
The outcome of Diaz's trial will not directly affect those lawsuits or other court cases, but could encourage workers to file new lawsuits against the company as it battles mounting challenges to its dominance of the electric car market.

's beer conforms to the 500-years old German brew law and the bottles have glow-in-the-dark design with a Giga logo.  says the sleeves' design is reminiscent of the Cybertruck's streamlined body, while the taste of the lager beers in the gift pack comes from an exclusive strain of Cyberhops.

Berlin brewers have created a special Cyberhops strain for , so that it can come up with an exclusive 3-pack of beer whose bottles celebrate the design of the 
most anticipated electric vehicle for the year, the Cybertruck
.


The so-called GigaBier, which is German spelling for, well, beer, evokes ""
notes of citrus, bergamot and sweet fruit

The bottle sleeves are clad in glossy black with a streamlined yet edgy shape reminiscent of the most  eagerly awaited electric pickup truck out there.  says that the bottle sleeves have a Giga watermark that glows in the dark as a nod to its Gigafactory near Berlin, too.


As for the beer itself, the Cyberhops brew is made in the Pilsner style, which is a kind of a pale lager that would fit the most popular tastes in beer.  often comes up with cooky merch, the most recent example of which was a perfume named ""Burnt Hair,"" but the GigaBier has every chance to become a gift for that significant other in your life who may be waiting on their Cybertruck order for months on end.


The GigaBier is pricey at US$30 a pop, but it would soothe the preorder pains, since the 
Cybertruck release may fall in the summer

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Securities Fraud Class Action:
 
The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period Defendants made misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) they significantly overstated the efficacy, viability and safety of Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving ('FSD') technologies; (2) Tesla's Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accidents and injuries associated with operating Tesla vehicles; and (3) all of the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm.
 
Investors began to learn the truth beginning on Apr. 18, 2021, when media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with no-one driving it crashed into a tree and killed two passengers.  
 
On Aug. 16, 2021, 
Forbes
 reported that U.S. regulators opened up a review of Tesla's Autopilot that centered around a string of collisions with emergency vehicles that resulted in numerous injuries and at least one fatality.
 
On June 3, 2022, 
Street Insider
 reported that regulators received hundreds of complaints from Tesla owners and issued a formal inquiry demanding all consumer and field reports Tesla received concerning false braking and reports of crashes, injuries and deaths, including whether FSD was active at the time of the incidents.
 
On Jan. 27, 2023, 
Bloomberg
 reported that the SEC is investigating Tesla's and Elon Musk's statements about the Autopilot system.
 
On Feb. 16, 2023, 
Bloomberg
 reported that regulators ordered Tesla to recall nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the FSD software, stating that the software may allow FSD-equipped vehicles to act in an unlawful or unpredictable manner.
 
Finally, on Feb. 18, 2023, 
Reuters
 reported that a Tesla vehicle crashed into a fire truck, killing the driver and injuring five people.
 
'We're focused on investors' losses and proving Tesla misled investors about the safety and efficacy of its Autopilot and FSD systems,' said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

SHANGHAI -- Tesla's Shanghai plant delivered 88,869 vehicles in March, up 35 percent year-on-year, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.
 
The US carmaker's R&D and innovation center in Shanghai is now carrying out more original development work on finished vehicles and charging equipment. David Lau, vice-president of software engineering at Tesla, noted that the company's teams in China ensure it can customize products for Chinese consumers.
 
The company's Shanghai plant delivered 710,000 vehicles in 2022, an increase of 48 percent from 2021.
 
Established in 2019, the Tesla Gigafactory in Shanghai is the carmaker's first Gigafactory outside the United States, with an industrial chain localization rate of more than 95 percent and 99.99 percent of the employees being Chinese.
 
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China is the largest new energy vehicle production and sales market globally.

electric car
 owners that their privacy 'is and will always be enormously important to us.' The cameras it builds into vehicles to assist driving, it notes on its website, are 'designed from the ground up to protect your privacy.' 
 
But between 2019 and 2022, groups of  employees privately shared via an internal messaging system sometimes highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras, according to interviews by Reuters with nine former employees. 
 
Some of the recordings caught  customers in embarrassing situations. One ex-employee described a video of a man approaching a vehicle completely naked. 
 
Also shared: crashes and road-rage incidents. One crash video in 2021 showed a  driving at high speed in a residential area hitting a child riding a bike, according to another ex-employee. The child flew in one direction, the bike in another. The video spread around a  office in San Mateo, California, via private one-on-one chats, 'like wildfire,' the ex-employee said. 
 
Other images were more mundane, such as pictures of dogs and funny road signs that employees made into memes by embellishing them with amusing captions or commentary, before posting them in private group chats. While some postings were only shared between two employees, others could be seen by scores of them, according to several ex-employees. 
 
 
'It was a breach of privacy, to be honest. And I always joked that I would never buy a  after seeing how they treated some of these people,' said one former employee.
 
Another said: 'I'm bothered by it because the people who buy the car, I don't think they know that their privacy is, like, not respected. … We could see them doing laundry and really intimate things. We could see their kids.' 
 
 
Another said: 'I'm bothered by it because the people who 
buy the car
, I don't think they know that their privacy is, like, not respected. … We could see them doing laundry and really intimate things. We could see their kids.' 
 
One ex-employee also said that some recordings appeared to have been made when cars were parked and turned off. Several years ago,  would receive video recordings from its vehicles even when they were off, if owners gave consent. It has since stopped doing so. 
 
'We could see inside people's garages and their private properties,' said another former employee. 'Let's say that a  customer had something in their garage that was distinctive, you know, people would post those kinds of things.' 
 
 didn't respond to detailed questions sent to the company for this report. 
 
About three years ago, some employees stumbled upon and shared a video of a unique submersible vehicle parked inside a garage, according to two people who viewed it. Nicknamed 'Wet Nellie,' the white 
Lotus Esprit
 sub had been featured in the 1977 
James Bond
 film, 'The Spy Who Loved Me.' 
 
The vehicle's owner:  Chief Executive 
Elon Musk
, who had bought it for about $968,000 at an 
auction
 in 2013. It is not clear whether Musk was aware of the video or whether it had been shared. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. 
 
To report this story, Reuters contacted more than 300 former  employees who had worked at the company over the past nine years and were involved in developing its self-driving system. More than a dozen agreed to answer questions, all speaking on condition of anonymity. 
 
Reuters wasn't able to obtain any of the shared videos or images, which ex-employees said they hadn't kept. The news agency also wasn't able to determine if the practice of sharing recordings, which occurred within some parts of  as recently as last year, continues today or how widespread it was. Some former employees contacted said the only sharing they observed was for legitimate work purposes, such as seeking assistance from colleagues or supervisors. 
 
Labeling pedestrian and street signs 
 
The sharing of sensitive videos illustrates one of the less-noted features of artificial intelligence systems: They often require armies of human beings to help train machines to learn automated tasks such as driving. 
 
Since about 2016,  has employed hundreds of people in Africa and later the United States to label images to help its cars learn how to recognize pedestrians, street signs, construction vehicles, garage doors and other objects encountered on the road or at customers' houses. To accomplish that, data labelers were given access to thousands of videos or images recorded by car cameras that they would view and identify objects. 
 
 increasingly has been automating the process, and shut down a data-labeling hub last year in San Mateo, California. But it continues to employ hundreds of data labelers in Buffalo, New York. In February,  said the staff there had grown 54% over the previous six months to 675. 
 
 
David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, called sharing of sensitive videos and images by  employees 'morally reprehensible. Any normal human being would be appalled by this.'
 
 
Two ex-employees said they weren't bothered by the sharing of images, saying that customers had given their consent or that people long ago had given up any reasonable expectation of keeping personal data private. Three others, however, said they were troubled by it. 
 
'It was a breach of privacy, to be honest. And I always joked that I would never buy a  after seeing how they treated some of these people,' said one former employee. 
 
Another said: 'I'm bothered by it because the people who buy the car, I don't think they know that their privacy is, like, not respected. … We could see them doing laundry and really intimate things. We could see their kids.' 
 
One former employee saw nothing wrong with sharing images, but described a function that allowed data labelers to view the location of recordings on Google Maps as a 'massive invasion of privacy.' 
 
David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, called sharing of sensitive videos and images by  employees 'morally reprehensible.' 
 
'Any normal human being would be appalled by this,' he said. He noted that circulating sensitive and personal content could be construed as a violation of 's own privacy policy — potentially resulting in intervention by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which enforces federal laws relating to consumers' privacy. 
 
A spokesperson for the FTC said it doesn't comment on individual companies or their conduct. 
 
'Your Data Belongs to You'
 
To develop self-driving 
car technology
,  collects a vast trove of data from its global fleet of several million vehicles. The company requires car owners to grant permission on the cars' touchscreens before  collects their vehicles' data. 'Your Data Belongs to You,' states 's website. 
 
In its Customer Privacy Notice,  explains that if a customer agrees to share data, 'your vehicle may collect the data and make it available to  for analysis. This analysis helps  improve its products, features, and diagnose problems quicker.' It also states that the data may include 'short video clips or images,' but isn't linked to a customer's account or vehicle identification number, 'and does not identify you personally.' 
 
Carlo Piltz, a data privacy lawyer in Germany, told Reuters it would be difficult to find a legal justification under Europe's data protection and privacy law for vehicle recordings to be circulated internally when it has 'nothing to do with the provision of a safe or secure car or the functionality' of 's self-driving system. 
 
 
'If a person parked one of these vehicles in front of someone's window, they could spy inside and see everything the other person was doing. That is a serious violation of privacy.' 
 
 
In recent years, 's car-camera system has drawn controversy. In 
China
, some government compounds and residential neighborhoods have banned s because of concerns about its cameras. In response, Musk said in a virtual talk at a Chinese forum in 2021: 'If  
used cars
 to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.' 
 
Elsewhere, regulators have scrutinized the  system over potential privacy violations. But the privacy cases have tended to focus not on the rights of  owners but of passers-by unaware that they might be being recorded by parked  vehicles. 
 
In February, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, or DPA, said it had concluded an investigation of  over possible privacy violations regarding 'Sentry Mode,' a feature designed to record any suspicious activity when a car is parked and alert the owner. 
 
'People who walked by these vehicles were filmed without knowing it. And the owners of the s could go back and look at these images,' said DPA board member Katja Mur in a statement. 'If a person parked one of these vehicles in front of someone's window, they could spy inside and see everything the other person was doing. That is a serious violation of privacy.' 
 
The watchdog determined it wasn't , but the vehicles' owners, who were legally responsible for their cars' recordings. It said it decided not to fine the company after  said it had made several changes to Sentry Mode, including having a vehicle's headlights pulse to inform passers-by that they may be being recorded. 
 
A DPA spokesperson declined to comment on Reuters findings, but said in an email: 'Personal data must be used for a specific purpose, and sensitive personal data must be protected.' 
 
Replacing human drivers 
 
 calls its automated driving system Autopilot. Introduced in 2015, the system included such advanced features as allowing drivers to change lanes by tapping a turn signal and parallel parking on command. To make the system work,  initially installed sonar sensors, radar and a single front-facing camera at the top of the windshield. A subsequent version, introduced in 2016, included eight cameras all around the car to collect more data and offer more capabilities. 
 
Musk's future vision is eventually to offer a 'Full Self-Driving' mode that would replace a human driver.  began 
rolling
 out an experimental version of that mode in October 2020. Although it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, it currently offers such features as the ability to slow a car down automatically when it approaches stop signs or 
traffic lights
. 
 
In February,  
recalled
 more than 362,000 U.S. vehicles to update their Full Self-Driving software after the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
 said it could allow vehicles to exceed speed limits and potentially cause crashes at intersections. 
 
As with many artificial-intelligence projects, to develop Autopilot,  hired data labelers to identify objects in images and videos to teach the system how to respond when the vehicle was on the road or parked. 
 
 initially outsourced data labeling to a San Francisco-based non-profit then known as Samasource, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The organization had an office in Nairobi, Kenya, and specialized in offering training and employment opportunities to disadvantaged women and youth. 
 
In 2016, Samasource was providing about 400 workers there for , up from about an initial 20, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
 
 
'I saw some scandalous stuff sometimes, you know, like I did see scenes of intimacy but not nudity,' said another. 'And there was just definitely a lot of stuff that like, I wouldn't want anybody to see about my life.' 
 
 
By 2019, however,  was no longer satisfied with the work of Samasource's data labelers. At an event called  AI Day in 2021, Andrej Karpathy, then senior director of AI at , said: 'Unfortunately, we found very quickly that working with a third party to get data sets for something this critical was just not going to cut it … Honestly the quality was not amazing.' 
 
A former  employee said of the Samasource labelers: 'They would highlight fire hydrants as pedestrians … They would miss objects all the time. Their skill level to draw boxes was very low.' 
 
Samasource, now called Sama, declined to comment on its work for . 
 
 decided to bring data labeling in-house. 'Over time, we've grown to more than a 1,000-person data labeling (organization) that is full of professional labelers who are working very closely with the engineers,' Karpathy said in his August 2021 presentation. 
 
Karpathy didn't respond to requests for comment. 
 
's own data labelers initially worked in the San Francisco Bay area, including the office in San Mateo. Groups of data labelers were assigned a variety of different tasks, including labeling street lane lines or emergency vehicles, ex-employees said. 
 
At one point, s on Autopilot were having difficulty backing out of garages and would get confused when encountering shadows or objects such as garden hoses. So some data labelers were asked to identify objects in videos recorded inside garages. The problem eventually was solved. 
 
In interviews, two former employees said in their normal work duties they were sometimes asked to view images of customers in and around their homes, including inside garages. 
 
'I sometimes wondered if these people know that we're seeing that,' said one. 
 
'I saw some scandalous stuff sometimes, you know, like I did see scenes of intimacy but not nudity,' said another.

Tesla Stock Update
 
Tesla 
TSLA
 announced first-quarter deliveries of 422,875 vehicles, which puts the firm in line to meet our 2023 total deliveries forecast of 1.81 million vehicles. Accordingly, we see no reason to change our $225 per share fair value estimate for Tesla. Our narrow-moat rating is also unchanged.
 
At current prices, we view Tesla shares as fairly valued with the stock trading in 3-star territory. While shares are a little more than 10% below our fair value estimate, we recommend investors wait for a larger pullback that would offer a greater margin of safety before considering an entry point.
 
Tesla's first-quarter deliveries were an all-time high for the company, up 36% year on year versus the prior-year quarter. Some of the growth was likely driven by the price cuts implemented at the start of the year. While the lower prices had the desired effect of growing demand, they will reduce the per-vehicle profitability, weighing on margins, partially offset by cost reductions from the continued ramp-up of the two new factories. We expect Tesla's profit margins will contract in 2023. We forecast companywide operating margins will shrink 260 basis points from 16.8% in 2022 to 14.2%.
 
When Tesla reports financial results later this month, we will look for management's plan in response to the U.S. Treasury Department's guidance on the Inflation Reduction Act. Based on the updated results, the least expensive version of the Model 3 will likely be ineligible for the $7,500 tax credit as the battery is produced in China. This has the potential to weigh on Tesla's sales growth in the U.S. as the lack of a credit may turn some consumers away. This will likely keep Tesla's sales volumes toward the lower end of management's 2023 guidance for 1.8-2 million vehicles.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Seth Goldstein",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/ROHC7ZXJXZU7LIKGTTYJTD667I.png,False,@MorningstarInc,7.6962337,ff92aa1ecb058b4f0feff79ea7f78081

The cuts that appeared Friday on Tesla's website ranged from $5,000 per vehicle for Tesla's slower-selling more expensive models, the S large sedan and the X big SUV.
 
The company lopped $2,000 off the price of the Y small SUV, its most popular model, and added a lower-cost dual-motor version priced at $49,990. The 3 small sedan saw a $1,000 price cut.
 
The moves come as Tesla's 
first-quarter sales grew 36%
 but fell short of analysts' expectations. The company said Sunday that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles worldwide from January to March, up from just over 310,000 a year ago. But the increase fell short of analyst estimates of 432,000 for the quarter, according to FactSet. 
 
A message was left Friday seeking comment from the Austin, Texas-based Tesla on why the prices were cut.
 
Guidehouse Research e-Mobility Analyst Sam Abuelsamid said the company needs to sell more vehicles to keep its factories running at full capacity. 'Overhead of underutilized plant eats up (profit) margin extremely quickly,' he said.
 
Tesla has added a huge plant near Austin to its U.S. factory footprint, in addition to its original plant in Fremont, California. The company also has built new plants in Shanghai and near Berlin.

Apparently Tesla cars have cameras inside as well as outside the vehicle, and the video footage is all sent to Tesla.

Employees at Tesla have been exporting these videos and making memes and sharing footage in internal chat rooms. This footage has included naked owners approaching their vehicle on their own property, random people walking by the vehicles, children, the contents of owners' garage, and more.

From the original story:

To report this story, Reuters contacted more than 300 former Tesla employees who had worked at the company over the past nine years and were involved in developing its self-driving system. More than a dozen agreed to answer questions, all speaking on condition of anonymity.

Most Tesla owners are unaware of the privacy issues that come from having such a highly instrumented vehicle.

As someone who once ogled Teslas (because, come on, they are gorgeous looking cars), I'm a big fan of moving away from oil to electric vehicles, and I'm grateful in hindsight that I didn't have the means to acquire a Tesla of my own.

By Reuters
: A federal jury in San Francisco on Monday ordered Tesla Inc to pay about $3.2 million to a Black former employee after he won a racial harassment lawsuit against the electric-vehicle maker, far less than the $15 million he rejected last year in opting for a new trial.
The verdict came after a week-long retrial in the 2017 lawsuit by plaintiff Owen Diaz, who in 2021 was awarded $137 million by a different jury. A judge agreed with that jury that Tesla was liable but said the award was excessive. He ordered a new trial on damages after Diaz declined the reduced $15 million award.

Diaz had accused Tesla of failing to act when he repeatedly complained to managers that employees at the Fremont, California, factory frequently used racist slurs and scrawled swastikas, racist caricatures and epithets on walls and work areas.
The jury on Monday awarded Diaz, who worked as an elevator operator, $175,000 in damages for emotional distress and $3 million in punitive damages designed to punish unlawful conduct and deter it in the future.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a tweet said ""the verdict would've been zero"" if the judge had allowed the company to introduce new evidence in the retrial.




If we had been allowed to introduce new evidence, the verdict would've been zero imo.

Jury did the best they could with the information they had. I respect the decision.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 
April 3, 2023


Musk added: ""Jury did the best they could with the information they had. I respect the decision.""

The company has said it does not tolerate workplace discrimination and takes worker complaints seriously.
Bernard Alexander, a lawyer for Diaz, urged jurors during closing statements on Friday to award him nearly $160 million in damages, and send a message to Tesla and other large companies that they will be held accountable for failing to address discrimination.
'Mr. Diaz's outlook on the world has been permanently changed,' Alexander said. 'That is what happens when you take away a person's safety.'
Tesla's lawyer, Alex Spiro, countered that Diaz was a confrontational worker who had exaggerated his claims of emotional distress, and said his lawyers failed to show any serious, long-lasting damage caused by Tesla.
'They're just throwing numbers up on the screen like this is some kind of game show,' Spiro said.
Lawyers for Diaz did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the verdict.

CASE SEEN 'FAR FROM OVER'
The verdict was surprisingly low considering the egregious conduct for which Tesla was found liable, said Ryan Saba, a Los Angeles-based employment lawyer who was not involved in the case.
But it could be cut even further because punitive damages are typically capped at no more than nine times the amount of damages for emotional distress and other injuries, Saba said. The punitive damages awarded by the jury on Monday were nearly 20 times the damages for emotional distress.
'I expect both sides will appeal,' Saba said. 'This case is far from over.'
Diaz testified last week, tearfully recounting various incidents during the nine months that he worked at the Fremont factory. Diaz said the job made him anxious and strained his relationship with his son, who also worked at the plant.

Lawyers for Tesla highlighted what they said were inconsistencies in Diaz's testimony and repeatedly raised the fact that he did not lodge written complaints to supervisors. Diaz testified that he verbally complained to managers numerous times and discussed his complaints with Tesla human resources officials.
The EV maker is facing similar claims of tolerating race discrimination at the Fremont plant and other workplaces in a pending class action by Black workers, a separate case from a California civil rights agency, and multiple cases involving individual workers. The company has denied wrongdoing in those cases.
Diaz had sued Tesla for violating a California law that prohibits employers from failing to address hostile work environments based on race or other protected traits.
The first jury in 2021 awarded Diaz $7 million in damages for emotional distress and a staggering $130 million in punitive damages. The award was one of the largest in an employment discrimination case in U.S. history.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick last year agreed with the jury that Tesla had broken the law, but said the award was excessive and cut it to $15 million.
Orrick said Diaz had worked at the factory for only nine months and had not alleged any physical injury or illness warranting a higher award.
On Friday, Orrick denied a motion by Diaz's lawyers for a mistrial. They claimed Tesla's legal team violated Orrick's bar on introducing new evidence in the retrial by questioning Diaz and other witnesses about incidents where he allegedly made racist or sexual comments.
Orrick said those questions were related to other incidents discussed in the first trial, and that Diaz's lawyers had not shown that the questioning prejudiced the jury.

The Tesla valve (TV), a valvular conduit invented by Nicola Tesla over a century ago, has recently acquired significant attention and application in various fields because of the growing interest in microfluidics and nanofluidics. The unique architecture of TV characterized by an asymmetrical design and an arc-shaped channel has long been an intriguing yet underrated design for building a passive component in a microfluidic system. While previously regarded as a technology without significant use, TV structures have been implemented in thermal manipulation fluidics, micromixers and micropumps, benefitting the advancement of urgently demanding technology in various areas, such as in biomedical diagnostics through wearable electronics and medical instruments, lab on a chip, chemosensors and in application toward sustainable technology manifested in fuel cell devices. This article presents the first comprehensive review of TV structures in the literature, which has seen significant growth in the last two years. The review discusses typical TV structures, including single-stage TV (STV), multistage TV (MSTV), and TV derivatives (TVD), along with their characteristics and potential applications. The designs of these structures vary based on their intended applications, but all are constructed based on the fundamental principle of the TV structure. Finally, future trends and potential applications of TV structures are summarized and discussed. This topical review provides a valuable reference for students, early-career scientists, and practitioners in fluidic devices, particularly those interested in using TV structures as passive components.

The Tesla valve (TV) is a fascinating invention that has a rich history. It was first patented in 1920 by Nikola Tesla, who was a renowned scientist and inventor in electromagnetic physics [
1
]. Tesla was inspired by his previous invention, the electronic rectifier [
2
], to design a device that could be used as a unidirectional conduit for fluids [
3
]. The valve's structure comprises a series of interconnected channels and obstructions that allow fluid to flow in one direction but restrict it from flowing in the opposite direction. TV has been extensively studied for their potential use in various applications, including fluidic control, energy devices, and biomedical engineering. The TV is unique because it relies solely on an asymmetrical channel design without the use of moving mechanical parts to rectify a fluid flow (
Scheme 1
). Despite their innovative design, TVs were initially overlooked as a technology without significant use and were considered a forgotten technology for many years [
3
,
4
]. However, in recent years, researchers have explored the potential of TVs in various applications, particularly in microfluidics. TVs have been useful in situations where low flow rates are required or in microfluidic devices where moving parts can cause complications or reduce the device's overall efficiency.
Interestingly, the TV phenomenon has also been found in nature. The physical mechanism of the TV has been noted in the spiral intestine of sharks, skates, and rays where its natural design crucially reinforces nutrient absorption because of the higher friction between the dissolved meals and the spiral intestine walls [
5
,
6
]. This natural TV-like geometry in these species significantly provides greater surface area for the process of nutrient absorption and digestion.
Besides the shark's spiral intestine, the TV structure has also been resemblant to the turtle's lung anatomy [
7
,
8
]. The lung is composed of four large lateral chambers and several smaller medical chambers. There is a broad intrapulmonary bronchus that traverses the lung in a zigzag pattern, supporting the total respiratory physiology. The natural occurrence of TV geometry has inspired various microfluidic configurations, aiming to harness the efficiency of a gas or fluidic transport and manipulation for several applications.
Using TV microchannels has been essential in a variety of applications, including as a valve, flow resistance, and micromixer because of their unique asymmetrical flow direction [
9
,
10
,
11
]. One of the key advantages of using a TV channel as a passive component in a microfluidic system is its integration with a channel in a plane dimension. This means that only a single-layer fabrication step is required in soft lithography fabrication, resulting in a simpler and more cost-effective manufacturing process. Another significant advantage of the TV channel is its reliability, as it does not require any moving parts, such as membranes, cantilevers, or spherical balls, which can be prone to mechanical failure [
10
,
12
]. This robustness and durability make the TV channel an attractive option for microfluidic devices, particularly those intended for harsh or demanding environments. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened new opportunities for the optimization and customization of TV microchannels for specific applications. By using algorithms and simulations, researchers can design and optimize TV channels with tailored properties, such as flow resistance and valve function, to meet specific requirements and enhance the overall efficiency of microfluidic devices. This integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and TV technology is expected to lead to further breakthroughs in microfluidics, enabling the development of highly efficient and reliable devices for a wide range of applications.
Besides its advantages over traditional valve designs, the Tesla valve has been found to offer a more comprehensive range of flow rates, with a constant diodicity in higher fluid flow rates [
13
], when compared to other passive valve designs, such as wing arrays. This unique feature of the Tesla valve makes it universally applicable for a wide range of applications, including in fuel cell devices for the gas flow of hydrogen decompression [
14
,
15
]. The diodicity performance of the TV channel can be further optimized by employing different periodicity and curvature designs of the structures [
9
,
16
]. Researchers have explored various design strategies to enhance the performance of the TV channel, such as by altering the spiral angle or introducing modifications to the channel geometry. These modifications can lead to significant improvements in the diodicity performance of the channel, increasing its overall efficiency and effectiveness. 
Figure 1
 displays the characteristics of the TV structure in forward and reverse flow directions, with an initial Reynolds number (
Re
) of 200. The figure highlights the differences in the flow patterns and velocity distributions between the forward and reverse flow directions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the TV channel in rectifying fluid flow. Overall, the unique properties and design flexibility of the TV make it a promising technology for a wide range of microfluidic and macroscopic fluidic applications.
Passive components, such as the TV channel, are acquiring increased attention in microfluidics and nanofluidics as they offer several advantages [
17
,
18
]. These components are cost-effective and can be easily integrated with sensors, making them more attractive for research and development. Passive components have disposable features, which are useful in applications where contamination or cross-contamination can cause issues. Another advantage of passive components is their smaller footprint, making them suitable for micro-scale devices. These components also have a simple control operation, which can help reduce complexity in microfluidic systems [
19
,
20
]. TVs have been studied for their use as passive components in microfluidics because of their straightforward design and effective fluidic control. In microfluidic devices, precise control over fluid flow is essential for numerous applications, including chemical and biological analysis, drug delivery, and microscale energy devices. TVs provide a straightforward and efficient solution for fluidic control as they can regulate flow with no external power or moving parts.
Although the TV has been known for over two decades, its integration into microfluidic devices is still relatively new. The limited number of research articles on TV in microfluidics indicates that the full potential of TV has yet to be explored [
3
]. We are motivated to investigate this gap profoundly and highlight the versatility and potential features of TV toward current technology trends for a wide range of applications, including lab on a chip, biochemical sensors, wearable devices, and green energy. Recent developments in microfluidics and nanofluidics, as the backbone of the miniaturized device, coupled with integrating sensors, have led to increased interest in passive components such as TV because of their cost effectiveness, disposability, and simple control operation of microfluidic devices. Despite the limited research (
Figure 2
), TV has shown promising results in various applications. For example, it can be used as a fluidic diode in a piston-based micropump to avoid flow back and limit the flow rate in particular devices, such as in DNA extraction where unidirectional flow is predominant to capture oligonucleotides in the solid phase membrane. 
Figure 2
 shows the trend of research articles using the TV in their study. In addition, the TV can play a substantial role in the future microfluidics system with complex fluid management, comparable to the role of a diode in complex microelectronic circuits (
Figure 3
) and another electric-like component in the fluid devices [
17
] which greatly fit futuristic applications such as in wearable diagnostic tools and photovoltaic devices development. There is a need for a topical review of TV structures in microfluidics, including the state-of-the art of TV structure, performance parameters, diverse designs, and their derivatives, current trends, emerging applications, challenges of future development, and a summary. This review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential and limitations of TV in microfluidic systems and pave the way for further research in this area.
The flow rate of a TV refers to the amount of fluid that can pass through the valve per unit of time. This parameter is critical in evaluating the valve's performance since it determines the rate of fluid flow and, consequently, the efficiency of the valve. The pressure drop, on the other hand, refers to the decrease in pressure that occurs as fluid flows through the valve. The pressure drop is essential in determining the valve's energy efficiency as it determines the amount of energy required to move fluid through the valve. Finally, diodicity refers to the valve's ability to rectify fluid flow, allowing fluid to flow in one direction while restricting it in the opposite direction. This parameter is crucial in determining the valve's suitability for different applications since some applications require unidirectional flow while others require bidirectional flow. Therefore, by evaluating these parameters, one can determine the effectiveness of the TV and its suitability for different applications.
A TV's flow rate (
F
) refers to the volume of fluid that can pass through it per unit of time. The typical flow rate in a TV depends on numerous factors, such as the valve's dimensions, the fluid properties, and the pressure difference across the valve. However, TVs have been shown to have higher flow rates than traditional check valves, especially at low Reynolds numbers. The flow rate can vary from a few milliliters per minute to several liters per minute, depending on the valve's design and the application. For example, in microfluidic applications, the flow rate may be as low as a few microliters per minute. In contrast, in industrial applications, it can be several liters per minute or even higher. The flow rate of a TV can be measured experimentally using flow sensors or calculated using computational fluid dynamics simulations. It can be expressed:
where 
F
 is the flow rate, 
V
 is the volume that passes the channel, and 
t
 is the time required to pass the volume of the liquid.
The pressure (
P
) drop across a TV refers to the difference in pressure between the inlet and outlet of the valve [
16
,
21
]. Typically, a high-pressure drop will be in the forward flow compared to the reverse flow. TV has been shown to have higher pressure drops than traditional check valves, which makes them suitable for fluidic rectification applications.
The pressure drop in a TV is typically lower than in a check valve, especially at low Reynolds numbers. In a traditional check valve, the pressure drop is primarily caused by the valve disc's weight and the spring tension that keeps it closed. This pressure drop can lead to a significant energy loss, especially in applications that require high flow rates.
On the other hand, TVs rely on the fluid's inherent properties to create the unidirectional flow. They do not have any moving parts, so the pressure drop is mainly because of the fluid's viscosity and the valve's geometric features. This results in a lower pressure drop and a more efficient flow compared to traditional check valves. The asymmetric geometry of the TV leads to a higher-pressure recovery, so the pressure after the valve is close to the inlet pressure compared to a check valve.
One way to define the efficiency in TV is the ratio of the pressure drop across the valve to the pressure drop in an equivalent straight channel. Both channels can be fabricated and connected in a single flow. This ratio is known as the pressure recovery factor (
PRF
) and can be expressed mathematically as:
where 
P
v
 is the pressure drop across the TV and 
P
s
 is the pressure drop in an equivalent straight channel of the same length and cross-sectional area. A higher 
PRF
 indicates better efficiency to reduce pressure drop.
The diodicity factor drives the performance of TV [
9
,
13
,
16
]. Diodicity refers to the directional flow behavior of a TV. When fluid flows in one direction through a TV, it experiences high resistance because of its complex geometry, creating a series of vortex-like flow structures that impede the fluid's progress [
22
]. However, when fluid flows in the opposite direction, it encounters much lower resistance and can easily flow through the valve. This directional flow behavior is like that of a diode in electronics, which allows current to flow in one direction but blocks it in the other. With TVs, this diodicity allows them to be used as passive components in microfluidic devices for controlling flow direction and preventing backflow. For example, TVs have been used as passive flow controllers in microfluidic mixers, where they help to ensure that fluids flow in the correct direction to achieve efficient mixing. They have also been used in microscale pumps",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Agnes Purwidyantri,Briliant Adhi,Briliant Adhi Prabowo,Prabowo,Purwidyantri",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/chemosensors/chemosensors-11-00256/article_deploy/html/images/chemosensors-11-00256-g001-550.jpg?1681980585,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,8.502254,38a60c6b77a0d45c52613ca738498288

356,Tesla's shrinking margins are 'keeping investors up at night',Insider,2023-04-20 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/04/20/tesla-s-shrinking-margins-are-keeping-investors-up-at-night/,autoblog.com,Tesla shares fell after the company turned in smaller margins for its first quarter. Here's what some analysts have to say about the results.,"Getty
 
 
 
Tesla
 shares dropped Thursday as investors zeroed in on declining margins at the 
electric vehicle
 maker, prompting some analysts to reduce price targets and weigh on the company's strategy of cutting prices to uphold demand. 
 
""With no rose-colored glasses: margins are now a delicate issue that are keeping Tesla investors up at night,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients Thursday. 
 
Tesla shares fell 7% to $167.69 during the session. The stock was still up about 36% so far in 2023. 
 
Tesla's 
first-quarter results
 included automotive gross margin excluding federal credits of 19.3%, sliding from 29.1% in the first quarter of 2022. Its operating margin, a profitability gauge, fell to 11.4% from 19.2% in the same period a year ago. 
 
Tesla CEO 
Elon Musk
 indicated the company's priority for now is growth over profit and said the company is  navigating through an ""uncertain'"" macro environment. 
 
""[It's] better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin and subsequently harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy,"" Musk told analysts during Tesla's conference call Wednesday. 
 
Net income dropped by 24% to $2.51 billion from a year ago, partially pressured by Tesla's price cuts. The 
latest round of cuts
 was issued just before the first-quarter results were released late Wednesday. Price tags on some 
Model Y
 units were reduced by $3,000. 
 
Here what some analysts are saying about Tesla's stock and its earnings report: 
 
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives – cut price target to $215 from $225. 
 
""The near-term margin pain for long-term demand/volume gain is a strategy the Street is mostly on board with, however dipping below the magical 20% threshold is a concern,"" said Ives. ""While the bearish 16%-18% gross margin number did not happen and Auto 
GM
 was better than worst-case fears, Tesla is perfectly comfortable going below 20% with Street questions about the trajectory going forward,"" he said. 
 
The company ""walks a tight rope"" between margin pressure versus driving stronger global demand for its Model Y and 
Model 3
 vehicles. Its delivery guidance of 1.8 million is achievable, said Ives. 
 
""In a nutshell, we remain very bullish on the Tesla story, HOWEVER this margin compression and price cut narrative must be carefully managed over the coming quarters as it now emerges as a clear overhang on the stock."" 
 
CFRA senior equity analyst Garrett Nelson – cut 12-month price target to $250 from $275 
 
""With not much in the way of new developments, and the company merely meeting Street expectations instead of beating them despite a modest gross margin miss, we view the stock's decline …. as understandable,"" said Nelson. 
 
""But with Austin and Berlin [factories] continuing to ramp, first deliveries of the Cybertruck, groundbreaking of the Mexico plant expected in the coming months, and a low-priced coupe that we believe will be introduced in '24, we remain at a Strong Buy.""
 
David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs - ""Shares could trade as low as $28"" 
 
""Tesla has grown deliveries at less than the 50% year-over-year (YoY) 'goal' in four straight quarters as well as for the full year 2022. If the company cannot meet its own growth goals, no matter how lofty, then the time has come for bulls to re-evaluate their growth expectations,"" said Trainer in a note from his investment research firm. 
 
""TSLA Has 85%+ Downside Even If Units Sold Grows 3.5x,"" he said. ""If we estimate more reasonable (but still very optimistic) margins and market share achievements for Tesla, the stock is worth just $28/share. Here's the math, assuming Tesla's: 
 
 
Net Operating Profit After Tax margin is 13% in 2023 and falls to 7% (equal to 
Toyota's
 TTM margin) in 2023–2031, • revenue grows at consensus rates in 2023 (26%), 2024 (30%), and 2025 (23%), 
 
revenue grows 10% a year from 2026–2031, and 
 
invested capital grows at a 6% CAGR from 2023-2031, then the stock would be worth just $28/share today – an 85% downside to the current price.""
 
 
Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois -  ""Still looking for a margin floor"" 
 
""Guidance of 1.8 million units maintained but Q1 did not give great confidence on price elasticity or a gross margin floor given priority on volume over near-term profitability,"" he wrote in a note that maintained Jefferies buy rating on Tesla with a $
230
 price target. 
 
""No gross margin guidance into Q2 likely to trigger some downward revisions to consensus, although cost indicators (logistics, commodities at worst point) and clear improvements in lithium cost.""

Tesla Earnings Update
 
We reduce our Tesla 
TSLA
 fair value estimate to $215 per share from $225 to reflect higher near-term margin compression as the company is pursuing a volume-over-unit profit strategy in the near term by cutting prices to spur demand. We reduced our near-term automotive profit margin forecast. Separately, we increased our outlook for the energy generation and storage segment to reflect higher growth as Tesla plans to build a new facility in China.
 
Our narrow moat rating is unchanged as Tesla should still generate excess returns on invested capital even in a lower-price environment.
 
The market reacted negatively to the company's first-quarter results immediately after they were released. Tesla reported automotive gross margins fell 480 basis points sequentially from 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 21.1% this quarter. The market may have reacted to management's cautious commentary that suggests lower margins are likely to remain, at least through 2023.
 
Tesla Stock Undervalued
 
At current prices, we view Tesla shares as undervalued, with the stock trading more than 20% below our updated fair value estimate.
 
While we reduced our near-term outlook, our long-term view is unchanged. We think Tesla's plan to reduce costs will drive long-term profit margin expansion. We continue to forecast roughly 5 million deliveries in 2030 with automotive gross profit margins recovering from the low-20% range this year to 29%, which is in line with the margins generated over the past two years.
 
Part of our view that Tesla will see long-term margin expansion comes from the company's operating leverage as revenue should grow faster than overhead expenses. This held true during the first quarter. Revenue grew 24% versus the prior-year quarter while selling, general, and administrative, and research and development expenses were roughly flat. Over the long term, we expect overhead expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue driving operating margin expansion.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Seth Goldstein",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/ROHC7ZXJXZU7LIKGTTYJTD667I.png,False,@MorningstarInc,8.030581,91652379cc03bbe180c2a8bfc0465ce0

The Austin, Texas-based company marked down each version of its Model Y sport utility vehicle by $3,000. It also cut the cost of the base Model 3 by 4.7 per cent to less than $40,000 for the first time in years.
Tesla's stock fell as much as 2.8 per cent to $179.08 before the start of regular trading Wednesday. The shares are up 50 per cent this year.
This is Tesla's second price cut in the US this month after several quarters of deliveries fell short of some analysts' expectations. The company is in the rare position among EV makers of having profit margins to work with, as incumbents including Ford Motor Co. and newer entrants like Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. struggle to make money at lower volumes.
After several rounds of reductions, the starting prices of Tesla's two high-volume models are substantially lower than they were to start the year. The base Model Y is 29 per cent cheaper, and the Model 3 can be had for 15 per cent less.
Musk has pushed back against media coverage of the cuts. 'We're not ‘starting a price war,'' the chief executive officer tweeted April 15. 'We're just lowering prices to enable affordability at scale.'
Following Tesla's first line-up-wide price cuts in January, Musk said weeks later that orders were running at almost twice the rate of production. But the carmaker was unable to sustain that dynamic – first quarter deliveries rose about 4 per cent from the prior three months, and Tesla produced almost 18,000 more cars than it handed over to customers.
Despite a second set of price cuts for the Model S and X in early March, Tesla delivered just 10,695 of those vehicles in the quarter, the lowest since the third quarter of 2021.
Tesla is due to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday in the US, where investors will focus on the toll that earlier price cuts are taking on profit margins. Another concern is the extent to which legacy manufacturers are ramping up EV production and luring consumers from Musk's limited portfolio of models, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in their preview note. – Bloomberg",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/Air4GHJYcA3B8JhyKJWNNkW7aho=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/QN3PFKYWIPFY7VH6BQAKIWA3QU.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,7.4659014,56d89ce1cf258c6b7db13f8f2f51ee72

The S&P 500 fell 24.73, or 0.6%, to 4,129.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 110.39, or 0.3%, to 33,786.62, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 97.67, or 0.8%, to 12,059.56.
Tesla weighed on the market for a second straight day on worries about how much profit it's making on its electric vehicles. It dropped 9.7% after reporting revenue for the first three months of the year that fell short of analysts' expectations as it repeatedly cut prices on its models.
Tesla's cutting prices ""is good for inflation,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""But for the market, the question has to be: You're cutting prices again, it seems like we're not seeing enough demand on the auto side.""
 
Several banks also dropped after reporting weaker profits and revenue than expected. The spotlight has been on smaller and mid-sized banks amid worries their customers may pull out deposits following the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history last month.
Zions Bancorp fell 4.9% and KeyCorp dropped 2.7%. Truist Financial fell 3.8% after reporting weaker profit than expected.
AT&T sank 10.4%, the worst day for its stock in two decades, after it reported slightly weaker revenue than analysts forecast, though profit squeaked past expectations.

In the bond market, yields fell after a couple reports on the U.S. economy.
Slightly more workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than the week before, a sign the job market might be softening due to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to tamp down inflation. A separate report said manufacturing trends in the mid-Atlantic region weakened by much more than economists expected.
The 10-year Treasury dipped to 3.53% from 3.59% late Wednesday. The two-year yield fell to 4.14% from 4.25%.
Helping to limit Wall Street's losses Thursday were big gains from companies that topped analysts' expectations.
Lam Research was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500 after the semiconductor manufacturing industry supplier rose 7.2%. It reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that beat forecasts.
Steel Dynamics climbed 4.9%, homebuilder D.R. Horton gained 5.6%, casino operator Las Vegas Sands rallied 3.7% and steelmaker Nucor rose 5.5% after reporting stronger-than-expected profit for the latest quarter.
Abroad, Asian stock indexes were mixed after data showed Japan's trade deficit narrowed in March. European stocks also were mixed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. has weathered multiple major financial crises, natural disasters, and dramatic shifts in consumer behaviors. Yet the vast majority of states have managed to grow enough jobs to keep the nation's economy going.
The U.S. has added close to 21 million jobs since 2003, while the population has grown nearly twice that amount. Over that time, more than two dozen states have increased their employment by double-digit percentages.
Swyft Filings
 used 
Bureau of Labor Statistics data
 to rank all 50 states and Washington D.C. by the percentage change in jobs from the second quarter (Q2) 2003 to Q2 2022, breaking ties according to which state had more overall job gains. For additional context about the labor force and earnings, statistics were also gathered from 
BLS data
 on average weekly wages, unemployment, and labor force participation, and state population information from 
Census Bureau data
.
The second quarter of 2022 marked the point at which most states had recovered all of the jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic—the biggest shock to the U.S. workforce and economy since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Some states have seen high-wage jobs grow more quickly than others over the last two years, including North Carolina, Florida, and Texas, according to credit rating agency 
Fitch Ratings
.
Over the two decades studied for this ranking, workers 55 and older became an increasing 
share of the national workforce
, and a far larger proportion than younger workers. In fact, roughly all of the employment growth from 2000 to 2020 was driven by workers 60 years and older, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic and the bullish stock market of 2020-2021 pushed many older workers to 
retire or depart the workforce
. According to a 
study
 from the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, the pandemic added more than one million Americans to the retired population—but retirement was often preceded by a period of unemployment, meaning that many may have chosen to retire when they weren't able to find another job. Older Americans have also suffered the largest share of 
pandemic-related deaths
.
A few states have seen near-stagnant job growth or an overall loss of jobs compared to 20 years ago, including West Virginia, 
Louisiana
, and Michigan. In West Virginia, economists at West Virginia University point to an 
overreliance on the coal export industry
 and low participation rate in the workforce as forces holding back economic growth. Only 1 in 2 adults in the state are working or looking for work.
Continue reading to see how states stack up regarding job increases over the last two decades.

The Elon Musk-led company has cut U.S. prices of its base Model 3 by 11% so far this year and that of its base Model Y by 20%–moves that come as the United States, its largest market, prepares to introduce tougher standards that will limit EV tax credits.

Yet, , earlier this month, reported a 4% sequential rise in deliveries in the first quarter, much less than the 17.8% sequential rise in the fourth quarter.
 
Alongside that, the aggressive price cuts have also raised concerns about the Austin Texas-based company's industry-leading profit margins.

The price bump comes in spite of what the brand's CEO indicated earlier this week when 
Tesla
 missed its first-quarter margin target. The Model S and Model X prices still remain far below what they were at the end of 2022.
 
As of April 21st, 2023, the Model S and Model X both cost between about $2,200 and $2,700 more than they did earlier this week, depending on the trim, with the flagship sedan starting from $85,000 and the crossover from $95,000. However, Tesla added three years of free Supercharging too.
 
Nevertheless, that's a complete reversal of what 
Elon Musk
 said Wednesday during an earnings call with investors. 'We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and a higher margin,' he said.
 
Seemingly as a result of that statement, Tesla stock saw a dive of almost 10 percent the next day. Today, the day after that, 
the Model X
 and Model S cost more. What an interesting coincidence. Analysts point to future profits and a long-term strategy as the reason that Tesla seems so willing to ditch margin at the moment.

Tesla's base models now start from less than US$40,000, as an immediate reaction to the loss of the federal tax credit privilege. Built with Chinese LFP batteries, the RWD versions are ineligible for the full $7,500 subsidy amount, so Tesla cut prices for the sixth time in a short while. 
E-Mobility






Just when other EV makers thought they are getting some breathing space in the price war that Tesla started, the world's largest electric car company slashed its prices yet again, for a sixth time in the span of a few months. It is not the big, up to 
30% cut that happened in January
, but it made a Tesla vehicle cross the symbolic US$40,000 price barrier southwards.


The basic single-motor Tesla Model 3 with rear drive now starts from US$39,990, down two grand, a day after it became 
ineligible for the full $7,500 federal subsidy on account of its CATL batteries
. Tesla also changed the wording of its price savings section to reflect that the Model 3 now qualifies for ""
up to $7,500 tax credit.
"" 


That's ""
$3,750 for Rear-Wheel Drive and $7,500 for Performance
,"" while just the other day all Tesla vehicles qualified for the full amount before the 
Treasury's guidelines for the tax credit implementation were enforced on April 17
. The Model Y price cut is even more significant, with both the LR and Performance Model Y versions now $3,000 cheaper.


As of April 18, there are only 6 electric vehicles in America which will get the $7,500 subsidy:
Ford F-150 Lightning pickup
Cadillac Lyriq
Tesla Model 3 Performance
Tesla Model Y 
Chevrolet Bolt
Chevrolet Bolt EUV
Chevrolet Blazer 
Chevrolet Equinox
 Chevrolet Silverado pickup
The last three haven't even started their sales yet, so the subsidy market is all for Tesla, Chevy Bolt, and the F-150 Lightning now.


With the tax credit, the RWD Model 3 now costs US$36,240 in white, very close to the 
original $35,000 starting price at launch way back in 2019
 when the standard Model 3 only had 220 miles of range. Tesla is preparing to release a 
""Project Highland"" mid-cycle upgrade to the Model 3
 which would trim production costs further. 


This may lead to another round of price cuts, leaving every other EV maker scrambling to adapt. Still, Tesla's stock may take a beating if the price war has significantly affected its margins when it reports Q1 2023 earnings today at 5:30 PM Eastern.

A Tesla customer's 
Model S
 cameras appeared to capture footage of a man setting the car on fire last week.
 
The Tesla owner, J.R. Harriston, 
told KREM2
 that he was visiting a friend in Spokane, Washington when his car was set ablaze overnight. He told the news outlet that Tesla's Sentry Mode recorded the incident, which took place at about 12:40 a.m. Saturday.
 
Harriston shared the video with the news station. It appeared to show a man walking up to the car with two cans and pouring the liquid on the 
electric car
. The footage then flashes bright orange as the car is apparently engulfed in flames.
 
""I can't fathom myself wanting to set fire to anything for any political reason, whatever,"" Harriston told local news. ""I just, I don't get it.""
 
Harriston told the publication that he had owned the Tesla for just over a year and it was his ""dream car."" A motive for the apparent crime has not been reported.
 
The Spokane Police Department did not respond to a request for comment from Insider ahead of publication, but told the local news outlet that it is investigating the incident as a case of arson. Insider was unable to reach Harriston.
 
Tesla and its CEO 
Elon Musk
 have also become increasingly polarizing in recent years. Some Tesla owners told Insider's Tim Levin this year that they planned to ditch their cars because of 
Elon Musk's antics
. A Tesla owner told CNN last year that they felt the electric car was 
""the new MAGA hat.""
 
 
Electric cars have also become targets for opponents of the EV revolution. Vandals have pulled stunts like 
stuffing ground beef
 into EV charging stations 
filling charging stations
 with gas 
trucks
 so that EVs aren't able to recharge — a practice 
known as ICEing.
 
Fortunately for Tesla owners, the vehicles have 
Sentry Mode,
 which records video of the car's surroundings when it detects ""suspicious activity.""  The feature has 
caught Tesla vandals
 in the past.
 
The cameras have sparked privacy concerns, however. Earlier this month, 
Reuters reported
 that Tesla employees had 
shared images
 from customers' footage. Tesla has not commented on the issue, but the report 
sparked a lawsuit.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made the news yet again, but this time for something pretty straightforward — a White House deal that could help countless Americans charge their electric vehicles. 
The Biden administration recently announced that Musk agreed to open a portion of Tesla charging stations to all EV drivers. These stations were previously exclusive to Tesla owners, but by the end of next year, 7,500 of the company's chargers will be available to everyone.

: Elon Musk raked up a storm on Twitter when he removed Blue Ticks from all the legacy verified accounts. Some of the prominent figures who lost their verification badge included Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, Bill Gates among others. Though the Blue Ticks are now back on some accounts, Shaadi.com founder and Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal got a tad cheesed off when his Blue Tick was taken away. He got so annoyed that he even announced that he would not buy the Tesla car he had planned to purchase.
In a tweet, Anupam Mittal expressed his unhappiness over losing his Blue Tick on Twitter. He decided to take revenge on Musk by dropping the idea of buying a Tesla car. Mittal said, 'Am cancelling my planned purchase of a Tesla â€æ ticked off.' His tweet got mixed reactions from the users. 
One of the Twitter users called out Mittal's 'hypocrisy'. He reminded him that even Shaadi.com charges as much as Musk is charging for its premium subscription plan. The user named Devesh Tiwari, who himself is a Twitter Blue subscriber, wrote, 'isn't it hypocrisy? One who charges premium on @ShaadiDotCom for same concept but throws tantrum for $8 per month while being consumer of other platform.'
While others called him out for not being able to pay Rs 560 a month despite running such huge businesses. The user named Mitul Mehra said, ' You can pay for @Tesla but you can't pay 560 bucks for @TwitterBlue .Honestly, you don't deserve one. Some users also suggested the Tiago EV, which is a cheaper electric vehicle available in India. 
Several prominent figures including Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and others lost their Blue Tick. Bachchan even called out Musk for removing his verification badge. However, soon after the chaos on Twitter, the public figures got their Blue Tick back. Musk even volunteered to pay for the subscription plans for his personal favourites including Stephen King and LeBron James. 
However, even then King was not amused. He asked Musk to give his Blue Tick to charity. He wrot, 'I think Mr. Musk should give my blue check to charity. I recommend the Prytula Foundation, which provides lifesaving services in Ukraine. It's only $8, so perhaps Mr. Musk could add a bit more.'

He also said that this is the 'beginning of the end' for Twitter.,"By Divyanshi Sharma
: Twitter recently took away the blue ticks from legacy accounts that had been verified before Elon Musk assumed his role as the company's owner. The move was long anticipated as back in November 2022, Musk had said that Twitter's blue tick would be coming at a price in the future. Presently, anybody can buy the once-precious Blue Tick by paying a monthly fee to subscribe to Twitter Blue. Additionally, accounts that do subscribe to Twitter Blue will have more reach and get access to some exclusive features. 
Musk, in a recent tweet, confirmed that verified accounts are now 'prioritised'. However, he didn't divulge any other details. 
Twitter's Blue Tick chaos
The process of removing blue ticks from legacy accounts started on April 1 and by April 20, the majority of accounts were no longer verified. However, Musk, who had earlier made it clear that nobody would be verified without a Twitter Blue subscription, soon took a U-Turn and began returning the Blue Ticks to accounts with more than a million followers. 
As a result, celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan, Alia Bhatt, Priyanka Chopra and others got their Blue Tick back. Even accounts of celebrities who have passed away were once again verified on Twitter. But there's a catch here. All the accounts that were returned the Blue Tick show that the account is a Twitter Blue subscriber. While in reality, they are not. 
Tesla investor calls Musk a hypocrite
Twitter and Tesla's top investor Ross Gerber has called out Elon Musk on this and says that the Twitter boss is a 'hypocrite' and that all this chaos at Twitter is the 'beginning of an end' for the platform, reports Business Insider.
""Elon went out of his way to insult people with blue checks as being entitled famous people, and implied that the system he was creating was this egalitarian free world where verification was just based off being you — and famous people wouldn't get this free privilege,"" he said. 
The Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management CEO added, ""So when he reversed himself he just looked like a total hypocrite, and then the way he did it was even worse because then he gave it to people with at least one million followers.""
He also talked about the verification badges being returned to accounts of celebrities who have passed away and called it a decision that 'makes no sense'. 
The Blue Tick on Twitter was originally intended to signify authenticity and was only granted to noteworthy individuals who applied for it at no cost. However, some Twitter users are now arguing that the Blue Tick has lost its meaning, as it is now available for purchase by anyone with the means to do so. In their view, the Blue Tick has become more of a symbol of Elon Musk's fan base rather than an indicator of a legitimate account.

This study investigated the ability of T2 mapping to assess the glenoid labrum and to differentiate between healthy labral substances and superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions using arthroscopy as the gold standard. Eighteen patients (mean age: 52.4 ± 14.72 years, 12 men) with shoulder pain were examined using 3-Tesla T2 mapping. All the patients underwent shoulder arthroscopy. Using morphological sequences for correlation, regions of interest covering the entire labral substance were placed in the corresponding T2 maps. The diagnostic cutoff values, sensitivities, and specificities, as well as the inter-reader correlation coefficients (ICCs) determined by two independent radiologists, were calculated. The mean T2 value was 20.8 ± 2.4 ms for the healthy labral substances and 37.7 ± 10.63 ms in the patients with SLAP lesions. The maximum T2 value in normal labrum (21.2 ms) was lower than the minimum T2 value in the patients with SLAP lesions (27.8 ms), leading to sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values of 100% (95% CI 54.1–100.0) for all the cutoff values between 21.2 and 27.8 ms. The ICCs ranged from 0.91 to 0.99. In summary, the data suggest that evaluation and quantification of the labral (ultra)structural integrity using T2 mapping may allow discrimination between arthroscopically confirmed SLAP lesions and a healthy glenoid labrum. T2 mapping may therefore be helpful in diagnosing patients with suspected labral damage.


 










 


Shoulder pain is a significant medical and socioeconomic problem that can lead to the inability to work and perform household or leisure activities. In a systematic review, Luime et al. reported a one-year prevalence of shoulder pain of up to 46.7% and a lifetime prevalence of up to 66.7% [
1
]. In addition, an age-dependent distribution has been reported, with older people being more likely to experience shoulder pain [
1
]. One repeatedly encountered source of shoulder pain affecting all age groups is superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions. The superior labrum plays an important role in the stability of the shoulder joint. Accordingly, SLAP lesions have been documented to cause both anterior and posterior instabilities in overhead athletes [
2
,
3
,
4
]. Microinstability, in turn, can lead to various shoulder injuries, including cartilage defects, and may progress to advanced osteoarthritis (OA) [
5
,
6
]. Despite the increasing understanding of its pathomechanisms and epidemiology, the diagnosis of superior labral lesions remains clinically and radiologically challenging.
Over the last few decades, the incidence of SLAP lesions has increased [
7
,
8
]. A study based on private insurance data from 2003 to 2013 reported a fivefold increase in the incidence of SLAP lesions [
9
]. In the younger population, traumatic shoulder injuries and participation in sports with overhead throwing movements are major causes of superior labral lesions, whereas chronic degeneration seems to play a major role in the development of SLAP lesions in older adults [
10
,
11
]. In 53 asymptomatic middle-aged subjects (45–60 years), non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a prevalence of up to 72% for superior labral tears [
12
]. A similar study found no labral tears but observed an 'abnormal labral signal' in 50% of a symptomatic subgroup in a comparatively younger cohort (25–55 years) [
13
]. However, in neither of these studies was the diagnosis confirmed via arthroscopy. Furthermore, histological post-mortem studies showed marked degenerative changes in the labral substance as well as the more frequent occurrence of labral tears with increasing age [
14
,
15
]. Thus, the continuous transition of age-related degenerative changes into manifest labral tears appears to be a relevant pathomechanism.
Along with the increase in incidence, there has been an increase in the number of surgically treated labral lesions [
7
,
8
,
16
]. While some studies have shown satisfactory postoperative outcomes [
17
,
18
], several recent studies have reported complications and the incomplete regression of symptoms, particularly in middle-aged and older patients, as well as in professional overhead athletes [
8
,
19
,
20
,
21
]. Therefore, timely diagnosis of early and potentially reversible damage to the collagen matrix is desirable to delay or prevent the clinical progression of manifest labral tears.
MRI, which is sometimes supplemented by MR arthrography, is the radiological gold standard for the morphological evaluation of the glenoid labrum [
22
,
23
]. The diagnostic performance of non-contrast MRI in superior labral tears has been studied several times, with variable results in terms of accuracy and sensitivity [
24
,
25
]. While some studies have reported high diagnostic accuracy for MR arthrography, others have demonstrated non-specific as well as non-sensitive results for MRI and MR arthrography in the diagnosis of SLAP lesions [
26
,
27
,
28
]. Early degenerative changes usually cannot be detected with conventional morphological MRI sequences; however, functional sequences such as delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC), T2* mapping, and T2 mapping allow the assessment of the biochemical composition of joint structures [
29
,
30
,
31
]. This enables the detection of damage to the ultrastructural integrity of cartilage or collagen networks. T2 mapping can detect and quantify early degenerative changes in the cartilage of numerous joints, including the wrist, ankle, metacarpophalangeal joints, and knee [
29
,
32
,
33
,
34
]. As high T2 values reflect disruption of the 3D collagen network and an increase in water content, T2 mapping may also be appropriate for fibrocartilaginous or collagenous structures such as the glenoid labrum and menisci, respectively. In knee OA, a correlation between high T2 values and histologically confirmed signs of meniscal degeneration was demonstrated [
35
]. However, the study included patients with severe OA who were scheduled for knee arthroplasty, indicating a high pre-test probability of concomitant meniscal degeneration.
To our knowledge, no studies to date have evaluated the diagnostic performance of T2 mapping for the assessment of the glenoid labrum. In addition, T2 mapping of the shoulder joint in general has hardly ever been studied, and only a few existing studies have validated this technique using arthroscopy.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of T2 mapping to assess the biochemical integrity of the superior labrum and to differentiate between individuals with and without SLAP lesions in patient cohorts with shoulder pain but not high-grade OA, using shoulder arthroscopy as the gold standard. As a secondary study aim, the interrater reliability was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
This study included patients with shoulder pain who were to undergo arthroscopy and were referred to our department for preoperative MRI over a period of 3 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: endoprosthetic replacement of the glenohumeral joint or osteosynthetic material involving the proximal humerus; prior tendinous or ligamentous refixation procedures; advanced OA (Kellgren–Lawrence score > 1); and age less than 18 years. Nineteen consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study initially. As one patient, in whom only a routine MRI protocol without T2 mapping sequences was inadvertently applied, had to be excluded, 18 patients remained for inclusion.
After inclusion into the study, the index test (3-Tesla MRI with T2 mapping) was performed in each subject. After a maximum interval of 6 days (mean interval: 4 days) the reference test (shoulder arthroscopy) was carried out. Subsequently, the subgroups were divided into 'healthy individuals' and 'patients with proven SLAP lesion' depending on the arthroscopy findings. Therefore, this study can be defined as a one-stage, case–control study according to item 5 of the STARD guidelines published by the EQUATOR Network in 2015 [
36
].
The 3-Tesla MRI system used in this study was a Magnetom Verio (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with a 70 cm gantry width and an 18-channel total imaging matrix. To ensure that the shoulder was as close as possible to the magnetic isocenter, all the patients were placed in a supine position with the head first and with the shoulder joint stabilized in external rotation. Proton density-weighted, fat-saturated MRI sequences as well as T1- and T2-weighted sequences without fat saturation were used for morphological assessment of the (fibro)cartilaginous joint structures. Oblique coronal and oblique sagittal sequences were oriented perpendicular and parallel to the glenoidal fossa, respectively. A multi-echo spin-echo sequence for inline T2 mapping provided by the manufacturer (syngo MapIT, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) was used as the study sequence. In this sequence, a pixel-wise, monoexponential, non-negative least squares fit analysis was used to derive the T2 relaxation times from the T2 parameters, which were then used for further analysis. A color-coded map was automatically generated from the quantitative T2 relaxation times. A detailed overview of the in-house shoulder protocol and the T2 mapping study sequence is given in 
Table 1
.
The morphological sequences were evaluated using a picture archiving and communication system (Centricity PACS, v. 4.0; GE Healthcare IT Solutions, Barrington, IL, USA). Two independent musculoskeletal radiologists with 19 (CR) and 6 (FW) years of experience in musculoskeletal MRI evaluated the morphological as well as the color-coded study sequences. Both readers had participated in previous training sessions on the morphological analysis of the glenoid labrum, which included cases beyond the scope of this study. In addition, both readers had experience in the evaluation of quantitative biochemical imaging techniques, particularly for cartilaginous structures. Both radiologists were blinded to the results of the arthroscopy, the clinical data of the patients, and the patients' names. There was no blinding of the study participants, who had been informed about the additional study sequences and who knew that they were scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy. In accordance with the retrospective, one-stage, case–control study design, randomization was not performed.
Both readers set parameters for slice selection, magnification, and windowing. During the reading sessions, the ambient light was reduced to a minimum.
The glenoid labrum was classified as either normal or damaged using morphological proton density-weighted, fat-saturated sequences. Following Snyder et al., irregular labral margins with increased signal intensity, stripping of the superior labrum from the glenoid, and a bucket-handle tear of the superior labrum, with or without extension into the origin of the long biceps tendon, were defined as SLAP lesions [
37
]. If none of these diagnostic criteria was met, the labrum was considered to be normal.
First, we used the proton density-weighted fat-saturated sequences to delineate the superior labrum and determine the optimal position for region of interest (ROI) placement. The first ROI was placed in the midsection of the glenoid fossa, where the labrum had the largest dimension and appeared triangular. To reduce the effect of artifacts or imperfect ROI placement, two additional ROIs were placed, one in the anterior slice and one in the posterior adjacent slice, leaving three sections for ROI placement (
Figure 1
). To provide the most accurate measurement results, the ROIs were first placed in the first echo images acquired from the multi-echo spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, which further supported the morphological delineation of the labral substance. A careful visual comparison with fat-suppressed, proton density-weighted sequences was performed to ensure that the entire labrum was captured. In the next step, the ROIs were copied into the color-coded parametric T2 map. Where necessary, the copied ROIs were adjusted to ensure that the final ROI did not include any artifacts, glenoid cartilage or cortex, joint capsule, supraspinatus muscle, or synovial fluid. The average T2 relaxation times of the three adjacent ROIs were used for further evaluation.
The presence or absence of SLAP lesions in the morphological proton density fat-saturated (PDfs) sequences did not influence the placement of the ROIs, as the whole dimension of the labrum was always analyzed and compared with the arthroscopy. However, we also assessed the presence or absence of SLAP lesions in the morphological PDfs sequences and compared the findings with those of the arthroscopy.
Shoulder arthroscopy was performed by one of the two experienced orthopedic surgeons. According to the in-house standard, the arthroscopies were performed under general intravenous anesthesia, with all the patients placed in the beach-chair position. A posterior approach was selected for diagnostic inspection of the glenoid joint. The glenoid labrum, glenoid cartilage, and intra-articular portion of the long biceps tendon were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. The labral lesions were classified according to the method described by Snyder et al. [
37

375,Is Tesla Stock a Buy After Earnings?,Seth Goldstein,2023-05-03 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1154643/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-after-earnings,morningstar.com,Cost reductions could result in higher profit margins for long-term investors.,"Tesla 
TSLA
 released its first quarter earnings report on April 19 after the close of trading. Here's Morningstar's take on what to think of Tesla's earnings and stock.
 
Key Morningstar Metrics for Tesla
 
Fair Value Estimate for Tesla
 
With its 4-star rating, we believe Tesla stock is undervalued when compared with our fair value estimate.
 
Our fair value estimate for Tesla stock is $215 per share. In the near term, we forecast that Tesla increases its annual total vehicle delivery volume to a little over 1.8 million in 2023, or roughly 37% versus 2022. However, because of price cuts far exceeding cost savings, we forecast automotive gross margin contraction in 2023 to 22% from the 29% achieved in 2022. Longer term, we assume Tesla delivers around 5 million vehicles per year in 2030. This includes fleet sales, an expanding opportunity for Tesla. We think Tesla will be successful in continuing to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per vehicle basis. Additionally, we assume Tesla's overhead expenses continue to decline as a percentage of sales as the company benefits from operating leverage as deliveries increase.
 
Read more about Tesla's fair value estimate.
 
 
 
What We Thought of Tesla's Q1 Earnings
 
Tesla's gross margin and operating margin declined further than what the market was expecting as price cuts weighed heavily on profits. The stock fell on the earnings report as a result.
We view the profit margin decline as temporary. While Tesla will likely see lower margins over the next couple of years, eventually the cost reductions that Tesla laid out at its investor day in March will reduce the unit production costs, boosting long-term profit margins.
Market sentiment may weigh on Tesla in the near term, but we still see strong profit growth over the long term, which should drive shares closer to our $215 per share fair value estimate.
 
 
 
Economic Moat Rating
 
We award Tesla a narrow moat rating. Tesla's moat stems from two of our five moat sources: intangible assets and cost advantage.
 
Intangible Assets:
 Tesla's brand cachet is not likely to be impaired anytime soon as other automakers move into the battery electric vehicle space because we expect the company to keep innovating to stay ahead of startup and established competitors. Tesla has a more high-tech vehicle with the ability to do drivetrain updates and other updates via Wi-Fi or a cellular connection, and customers do not have to visit a store for many service needs. Tesla's proprietary technology contributes to its intangible asset-driven competitive advantage.
Cost Advantage: 
We think Tesla benefits from a cost advantage in electric vehicle production thanks to its manufacturing scale. Tesla's total vehicle volume has grown from just over 100,000 in 2017 to over 1.3 million deliveries in 2022. We think Tesla's combination of intangible assets and cost advantage will persist in the future and allow the firm to generate excess returns on capital.
 
Read more about Tesla's moat rating.
 
Risk and Uncertainty
 
We assign Tesla an Uncertainty Rating of Very High as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company. The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As new lower-priced EVs begin selling, Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices, reducing the firm's industry-leading profits. Tesla faces environmental, social, and governance risks. As an automaker, Tesla is subject to potential product defects that could result in recalls, including its autonomous driving software. Another risk involves employee retention. If Tesla is unable to retain key employees, such as CEO Elon Musk, its favorable brand image could decline. Additional ESG risks include potential patent litigation as the company relies on new technology to improve its EVs and energy storage systems.
 
Read more about Tesla's risk and uncertainty.
 
TSLA Bulls Say
 
Tesla has the potential to disrupt the automotive and power generation industries with its technology for EVs, autonomous vehicles, batteries, and solar generation systems.
Tesla will see higher profit margins as it reduces unit production costs over the next several years.
Through the combination of its industry-leading technology and unique supercharger network, Tesla offers the best function of any EV on the market, which should result in its maintaining its market leader status as EV adoption increases.
 
TSLA Bears Say
 
Traditional automakers and new entrants are investing heavily in EV development, which will result in Tesla seeing a deceleration in sales growth and being forced to cut prices due to increased competition, eroding profit margins.
Tesla's reliance on batteries made in China for its lower-priced Model 3 vehicles will hurt sales as these autos will not qualify for U.S. subsidies.
Solar panel and battery prices will decline faster than Tesla can reduce costs, resulting in little to no profits for the energy generation and storage business.

The facility will push Tesla outside its core focus of building automobiles and into the complex area of lithium refining and processing, a step Musk said was necessary if the auto giant was to meet its ambitious EV sales targets.
""As we look ahead a few years, a fundamental choke point in the advancement of electric vehicles is the availability of battery grade lithium,"" Musk said at the ground-breaking ceremony on Monday, with dozers and other earth-moving equipment operating in the background. Musk said Tesla aimed to finish construction of the factory next year and then reach full production about a year later.
The move will make Tesla the only major automaker in North America that will refine its own lithium. Currently, China dominates the processing of many critical minerals, including lithium. ""Texas wants to be able to be self-reliant, not dependent upon any foreign hostile nation for what we need. We need lithium,"" Texas Governor Greg Abbott said at the ceremony.
Musk did not specify the volume of lithium the facility would process each year, although he said the automaker would continue to buy the metal from its vendors, which include Albemarle Corp and Livent Corp. ""We intend to continue to use suppliers of lithium, so it's not that Tesla will do all of it,"" Musk said.
Albemarle plans to build a lithium processing facility in South Carolina that will refine 100,000 tons of the metal each year, with construction slated to begin next year and the facility coming online sometime later this decade. Musk did not say where Tesla will source the rough form of lithium known as spodumene concentrate that will be processed at the facility, although Tesla has supply deals with Piedmont Lithium Inc and others.

Tesla said it would eschew the lithium industry's conventional refining process, which relies on sulfuric acid and other strong chemicals, in favor of materials that were less harsh on the environment, such as soda ash.
""You could live right in the middle of the refinery and not suffer any ill effect. So they're very clean operations,"" Musk said, although local media reports said some environmental advocates had raised concerns over the facility.
Monday's announcement was not the first time that Tesla has attempted to venture into lithium production. Musk in 2020 told shareholders that Tesla had secured rights to 10,000 acres in Nevada where it aimed to produce lithium from clay deposits, which had never been done before on a commercial scale.
While Musk boasted that the company had developed a proprietary process to sustainably produce lithium from those Nevada clay deposits, Tesla has not yet deployed the process. Musk has urged entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business, saying it is like ""minting money."" 
""We're begging you. We don't want to do it. Can someone please?"" he said during a conference call last month. Tesla said last month a recent plunge in prices of lithium and other commodities would aid Tesla's bruised margins in the second half of the year.

385,"Tesla Should Analyze Impact to Investors if Elon Musk Leaves, Morningstar Sustainalytics Says",Leslie Norton,2023-05-12 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1157391/tesla-should-analyze-impact-to-investors-if-elon-musk-leaves-morningstar-sustainalytics-says,morningstar.com,What's key-person risk? Here's why Sustainalytics supports a key-person risk proxy proposal at Tesla.,"Tesla's 
TSLA 
board should analyze the impact on investors if CEO Elon Musk or other key officials leave the company, a shareholder is proposing. Morningstar Sustainalytics, in a report, is advising investors to support the proposal at Tesla's May 16 annual meeting.
 
The shareholder 
proposal
 asks the board to prepare and disclose a report on Tesla's so-called key-person risk. That means the board would identify key persons, like Musk, on whom the company is overly reliant—and whose absence or behavior would affect the firm's value. In addition, it says the report should have procedures for dealing with key-person risk. They include identifying the key persons, training successors, and mitigating the financial impact of the loss of a key person. The proposal was made by Karen Robertsdottir, a shareholder in Reykjavik, Iceland.
 
Some Examples of Key-Person Risk
 
Key-person risk isn't unfamiliar in the corporate sector. Consider Berkshire Hathaway 
BRK.A
 and its founder, Warren Buffett, widely considered to be one of the 
greatest investors
 of all time. Berkshire investors 
expect
 shares to come under pressure if and when Buffett dies or if he becomes mentally incapacitated. Berkshire is a prime example of key-person risk: After all, ratings agencies have 
downgraded
 Berkshire in the past precisely because of it.
 
Sometimes, key-person risk arises from CEO misconduct. Consider the 
case
 of Carlos Ghosn, the chair of Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors, who was accused of underreporting his compensation. Ghosn is now a fugitive in Lebanon.
 
And the fortunes of companies, like Tesla, can be
 overly tied
 to a CEO's actions. Tesla's shares fell sharply in April 2022 as news emerged that Musk was interested in buying Twitter. Since then, Musk has become Twitter's CEO, and reportedly 
pulled 
dozens of Tesla engineers to reshape Twitter. News that Musk found a new CEO to replace him at Twitter 
lifted
 Tesla shares.
 
 
 
Underperformance Can Follow Key-Person Risk
 
Indeed, underperformance often accompanies key-person risk. Shareholder Robertsdottir cited a 2018 Morgan Stanley report that found that in 2017 59 S&P 500 CEOs left their companies. These companies then underperformed the market by 11% in the subsequent 12 months.
 
'In light of widespread concerns that Tesla's board does not exercise effective oversight of its CEO and, as a consequence, the significant key person risk that Tesla's shareholders face, we recommend a vote in support of this resolution,' Sustainalytics wrote.
 
In an interview, Jackie Cook, the author of the Sustainalytics report and director of stewardship at Sustainalytics, said the proposal 'succinctly summarizes some of the core governance problems at the company.'
 
Tesla opposes the shareholder proposal. It says the board and company management are best equipped to carry out succession planning and handling day-to-day hiring, promotion, and termination decisions. It also says that adopting the proposal would cause competitive harm to Tesla.
 
Nevertheless, in its most recent 10-K report, Tesla identifies key-person risk and says, 'In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.'
 
Other Tesla Shareholders Recommend Voting Against New Board Nominee
 
Separately, a group of Tesla investors are recommending that shareholders vote against a new board nominee, J.B. Straubel, arguing that Straubel is a company insider who wouldn't increase board independence. Straubel is a Tesla co-founder and former chief technology officer who is CEO of privately held battery company Redwood Materials.
 
In an SEC 
filing
, the group says Tesla's board already 'has strong ties to CEO Elon Musk, with his brother, Kimbal Musk, and Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch, who count themselves as his personal friends, serving as directors.' The group said the board's current weakness allowed it to rubber-stamp a $56 billion pay package to Musk in 2018, which the Delaware Court of Chancery said should be regarded with 'heightened judicial suspicion' owing to the conflict of interest between the approval of the pay package and Musk's status as a controlling shareholder.
 
The group includes Nordea Asset Management, Pension Danmark, NIA Impact Capital, SOC Investment Group, and others.
 
Musk's Twitter Adventure Shows Key-Person Risk
 
The proposal 'might have a good chance to pass,' Morningstar strategist Seth Goldstein said in an interview. 'If Musk stepped down operationally, I think it's a risk for the stock.' For example, Goldstein relates, when Musk purchased Twitter, Tesla's stock fell. When Musk made politically charged tweets, Tesla's stock also fell on worries that his tweets would drive away consumers, the analyst continues. Currently, Goldstein
 rates
 Tesla as undervalued.
 
In the past, Tesla has 
responded 
to some shareholder proposals. For example, after Calvert Research & Management, a unit of Morgan Stanley, was supported by a majority of shareholders on a proposal asking Tesla to provide more data about its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, Tesla provided detailed EEO-1 data from its filings with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
 
Even for non-Tesla investors, Tesla's annual meeting is 'the most interesting' of the season, partly because of the key-person risk proposal as well as Tesla's decision to change the date of its annual meeting by several weeks, making it difficult for shareholders to file other proposals, Cook of Sustainalytics says.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,Leslie Norton,https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/PAH5JTBS5FELPK2CHNTA5BTTYU.jpg,False,@MorningstarInc,7.169892,68151862697f53a42872b73c03887254

Tesla may have found a potential successor to Elon Musk after all, according to a 
recent report from The Wall Street Journal.
 
Board members have considered making the company's chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, the next CEO of Tesla, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the issue. The publication said that Kirkhorn's name was mentioned before a 
trial last year
 over Musk's $44 billion Tesla pay package. 
 
The lawsuit from a Tesla shareholder 
claimed
 that Musk's 2018 compensation plan was ""beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment"" and alleged that the funds had enabled the billionaire to focus on his other companies — including his recent Twitter acquisition, which has 
spurred concern
 from other Tesla investors. The lawsuit has yet to be resolved.
 
During the trial, Tesla board member James Murdoch said that Musk had 
identified a potential successor
 within the months leading up to the trial, but the board member did not specify who Musk had suggested.
 
The Journal compared Musk's relationship with Kirkhorn to the connection between Apple cofounder Steve Jobs and the company's current CEO, Tim Cook, inasmuch as both Jobs and Musk have been willing to take ""risky bets"" in order to build their companies, while Cook and Kirkhorn appear to have taken a more cautious approach and have helped keep the companies in balance. 
 
Tesla staff who worked with Kirkhorn told the Journal that the CFO is adept at responding to Musk's requests and taking on the role as a mediator between the billionaire and other workers. In the past, former executives have said the billionaire can be a difficult person to work for, prone to 
bouts of anger
 and even instances of 
rage-firing employees
 — allegations Musk has adamantly denied, calling them  
""false"" on Twitter
 and 
saying he gives ""clear and frank"" feedback
 to employees. Former SpaceX executive Jim Cantrell 
previously told Insider
 that Musk can be ""vicious"" when his expectations aren't met.
 
Tesla cofounder J. B. Straubel told the publication that Kirkhorn works well with Musk because he is careful to ""share the bad news even louder and faster than the good news."" Straubel was 
nominated
 to Tesla's board in April.
 
Kurt Kelty, a former senior director of 
battery
 technology at Tesla, told the Journal that the CFO ""doesn't take the limelight from Elon.""
 
Over the years Musk's persona has become virtually synonymous with Tesla's brand. Tesla cofounder Martin Eberhard 
previously told Insider
 that his relationship with Musk went sour when he became the face of Tesla in its early days, adding that Musk would call him and 
""scream"" at him
 when he wasn't mentioned in a news article about the company.
 
Some former executives told the publication that Kirkhorn addresses many everyday operations even outside of company finances. Meanwhile, the executive has kept a low profile on social media and in the news.
 
Musk and Kirkhorn did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. A spokesperson for Tesla also did not respond to a request for comment.
 
Kirkhorn has worked at Tesla for over a decade. He first started out at as senior analyst at the car company in 2010, per his LinkedIn profile. He took over as CFO from Deepak Ahuja in 2019 and over the past four years Tesla's value has surged. Prior to joining Tesla he worked as an analyst at McKinsey & Company, as well as interned at Microsoft, his profile shows. 
 
Kirkhorn is not the only Tesla executive who is 
rumored
 to be a potential successor to Musk. Earlier this year, several news outlets 
speculated
 that the carmaker's chief in 
China
, Tom Zhu, could be Musk's successor after he took over leadership of Tesla's US assembly plants and sales in both North America and Europe in January, per a 
report from Reuters.

Autopilot
 because the cars can't drive themselves, the top U.S. transportation official says. 
 
Transportation Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg
 says he's concerned about Tesla's marketing of the system, which is under investigation by his department in connection with crashes that have caused at least 14 deaths.
 
'I don't think that something should be called, for example, an Autopilot, when the fine print says you need to have your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road at all times,' Buttigieg said in an interview with The Associated Press.
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an agency within Buttigieg's department, 
has sent investigative teams to more than 30 crashes
 since 2016 in which Teslas suspected of operating on Autopilot or its more sophisticated automated Full Self-Driving system have struck pedestrians, motorcyclists, semi trailers and parked emergency vehicles.
 
The probes are part of 
a larger investigation by the NHTSA
 into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. The NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.
 
Tesla, based in Austin, Texas, didn't immediately return messages left Thursday by the AP seeking comment.
 
Autopilot can keep a car in its lane and away from vehicles in front of it, while Full Self-Driving can take on most driving tasks. But in each case, Tesla tells owners they must be ready to intervene at all times. 
 
Buttigieg said the Transportation Department will hold Tesla or any other company accountable for complying with federal safety standards. 'We call balls and strikes,' he said. ""I view it as something where it's very important to be very objective. But anytime a company does something wrong or a vehicle needs to be recalled or a design isn't safe, we're going to be there.""
 
In the Wednesday interview, Buttigieg said that self-driving vehicles have enormous potential to reduce the nearly 40,000 U.S. roadway deaths that happen each year, a level that he called unacceptable. But he said the technology has not been proved yet. 'It's far from automatic that it's going to meet that potential,"" he said. 'That's what we're trying to shape here at the Department of Transportation.'
 
The NHTSA also is looking at Tesla's Full Self-Driving system. In February, the agency pressured Tesla into 
recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles
 with the software because the system can break traffic laws. The problem was to be fixed with an online software update.
 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he 
expects to have fully autonomous vehicles this year
, a pledge he has made for several years. 'The trend is very clearly toward full self-driving,' Musk said in April. 'And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year.'
 
The system is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners. But the NHTSA said in documents that the system can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to speed limit changes.
 
The NHTSA also has opened investigations during the past three years into Teslas braking suddenly for no reason, suspension problems and other issues.
 
Buttigieg wouldn't comment specifically on the pending investigations. 'Both outside bodies, states and other regulatory entities on the marketing side, and us from a vehicle safety perspective, are always paying attention,' he said. 
 
No vehicle on sale today can drive itself, he stressed, saying that drivers must pay attention in all cases. 
 
The Justice Department 
also has asked Tesla for documents
 about Full Self-Driving and Autopilot.

: Electric carmaker Tesla has proposed setting up a factory in India to build its electric vehicles for domestic sale and export, reported news agency Reuters.
Quoting a source with direct knowledge, the news agency said the carmaker has expressed interest to build a factory in India and build electric vehicles locally.
The move could be a game changer for the Indian EV market, which still makes up a fraction of the total vehicles manufactured in the country.
However, the company did not discuss lowering import taxes on electric cars. This was the reason why Tesla had earlier put its plan to 
sell its vehicles in India on hold

If Tesla successfully sets up a factory in India to build EVs, it is likely to drastically bring the prices of its expensive electric vehicles.
Senior Tesla executives are in India this week to meet the government and discuss local sourcing of parts and other issues.
Nearly one year ago, Tesla had put on hold its plans to sell cars in India after failing to secure lower import taxes, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk said were among the highest in the world.
It may be noted that Tesla cars come with a high price tag and high import duty would have put it out of reach for most Indians.
However, Tesla's proposal for local manufacturing and sourcing of parts could make a major difference, and make its electric vehicles much more affordable.
If the plan works out, it will be a win-win situation for both India and Tesla, with the former focused on becoming the manufacturing hub of the world and the latter looking to expand its supply chain beyond China.

392,State Supreme Court overturns judge's ruling prohibiting Tesla dealership in Delaware,Associated Press,2023-05-15 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/05/15/state-supreme-court-overturns-judges-ruling-prohibiting-tesla-dealership-in-delaware,ny1.com,Delaware's Supreme Court has overturned a judge's ruling upholding a decision by state officials to prohibit electric vehicle maker Tesla from selling its cars directly to customers,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — 
 
Delaware's Supreme Court on Monday overturned a judge's ruling upholding a decision by state officials to prohibit electric vehicle maker Tesla from selling its cars directly to customers.
 
In a ruling last year, a Superior Court judge determined that Delaware's Motor Vehicle Franchising Practices Act prohibited Tesla, as a manufacturer, from selling its electric cars directly to customers in Delaware.
 
The Supreme Court reversed that decision and sent the case back to Superior Court, noting that the franchise act was enacted to address the disparity in bargaining power that permitted automobile manufacturers to exert economic pressure over their franchises. The justices said the law's definitions exclude Tesla because the company sells its vehicles directly to consumers without using independent franchise dealers.
 
'It bears repeating that the Franchise Act regulates the business relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer,' wrote Chief Justice Collins Seitz Jr., adding that nothing in the law or its legislative history supports DMV's interpretation that the Franchise Act is intended to prohibit the direct sales model.
 
The court ruling noted that Tesla has fought similar battles in several other states.
 
Tesla filed an application with the Delaware DMV for a dealer license in 2019. The DMV subsequently permitted Tesla to open a new car gallery in a shopping mall. The gallery allows customers to view Tesla vehicles, but Tesla cannot sell its cars from an in-state store. 
 
Tesla submitted a second application for a dealer license in 2020. The DMV's Chief of Compliance and Investigation denied it, noting that Delaware's Licensing Act for automobile dealers requires that an applicant comply with state law before an application can be granted. The DMV official said Tesla's application did not comply with the law because the Franchise Act prohibits a vehicle manufacturer from directly or indirectly owning an interest in a dealership or from acting as a dealer. Despite determining that Tesla and its direct-to-consumer sales model did not meet the definition of a 'new motor vehicle dealer' under the franchise law, the official concluded that Tesla was still a 'manufacturer' under the law.
 
An administrative hearing officer later agreed that, as a manufacturer, Tesla could not sell new vehicles directly to Delaware consumers. 
 
Tesla then appealed to the Superior Court, where it lost again. The judge ruled against Tesla even though he agreed that its business model was likely not contemplated by the franchise law. He also found that a Tesla cannot be defined as a 'new motor vehicle' because that term applies to a vehicle that has been sold to a dealer. The judge also concluded that Tesla is not a 'new motor vehicle dealer' because it does not enter into franchise agreements with third parties.
 
'When the definitions are read together, a ‘manufacturer' under the Franchise Act manufactures or assembles ‘new motor vehicles' that have been sold to a ‘new motor vehicle dealer,'' Seitz wrote. '… Tesla's electric cars will not be sold to a dealer that holds a valid sales contract by Tesla, and therefore it is not a ‘manufacturer.''

. 
Tim Levin/Insider
 
 
 
A man in New York is suing 
Tesla
 after he says one of their vehicles ""suddenly and automatically"" accelerated, causing him to crash it in order to stop it and avoid hitting people nearby.
 
The lawsuit, filed this week in 
New York State Supreme Court
, says Akm Shamsuzzaman showed up for work at Revel Transit, where he was employed as a driver, on January 29 and was assigned to drive a Tesla that day. But things went south after he started the Tesla, the lawsuit claims.
 
""He had his foot on the 
brake
. He put the car into drive, took his foot off the brake, and then the car jumped forward,"" Daniel Shimko, Shamsuzzaman's attorney, told Insider, adding Shamsuzzaman went through the normal routine for starting a Tesla. 
 
Shimko explained that as soon as Shamsuzzaman took his foot off the brake, he lost control of the 
Tesla
. Even after he put his foot back on the break, the car would not stop, Shimko added. Shamsuzzaman also tried putting the car back into park but that didn't work either.
 
""He had to crash the car to get it to stop,"" Shimko said, adding that Shamsuzzaman was able to crash the Tesla into another open parking space and avoid hitting anyone else.
 
Shimko said Shamsuzzaman was not severely injured in the incident. He is seeking undetermined damages.
 
Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
 
Tesla
 has previously denied that its vehicles experienced ""unintended acceleration.""
 
The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
 conducted an investigation into reports of accelerating Teslas, looking into more than 200 crash incidents, and concluded it was user error. Specifically, the 
NHTSA
 found Tesla drivers were mistaking the accelerator for the brake.
 
However, last week 
Tesla said it was recalling
 more than 1 million of its vehicles sold in China, citing an issue with their regenerative braking system that Chinese regulators said could cause unintended acceleration.
 
In February, 
Tesla
 recalled more than 326,000 cars due to a software issue that could cause the vehicles to act ""unsafe"" in intersections.

The summary order by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan was released just days after a three-judge panel heard lawyers' arguments in the case.
 
Musk had challenged a lower court judge's ruling last year requiring him to abide by the deal on the grounds that circumstances have changed and because the decree contains a 'prior restraint' that Musk contends violates the First Amendment.
 
The settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission required that his tweets be approved first by a Tesla attorney. It also called for Musk and Tesla to pay civil fines over the tweets in which Musk said he had 'funding secured' to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
 
The funding wasn't secured and Tesla remains public.
 
In its ruling, the 2nd Circuit said it saw 'no evidence to support Musk's contention that the SEC has used the consent decree to conduct bad-faith, harassing investigations of his protected speech.'
 
Instead, it said, the SEC had opened 'just three inquiries into Musk's tweets since 2018' and each challenged tweet 'plausibly violated the terms of the consent decree.'
 
The appeals court also rejected Musk's prior restraint argument, saying parties entering consent decrees may voluntarily waive their First Amendment and other rights.
 
Lawyers in the case did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
 
The SEC was investigating whether the Tesla CEO's November 2021 tweets asking Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock violated an October 2018 settlement that Musk signed after the SEC brought an enforcement action against him alleging that his tweets about going private violated antifraud provisions of securities laws.
 
In a written ruling in April 2022, Judge Lewis Limon said Musk sent the tweets without getting pre-approval.
 
Musk's deal with the SEC called for Musk and Tesla to each pay $20 million in fines over Musk's tweets about having secured funding to take Tesla private. The funding was not secured but Tesla's stock price jumped in response to the tweets and trading in the shares was subsequently halted.

: Twitter CEO Elon Musk does not support the idea of passing down wealth to children who are not deserving of it. According to Musk, executives should not transfer their shares to their children if they lack the interest or inclination to manage the companies. Instead, he believes it is better to hand over the reins to deserving individuals within the company rather than simply giving shares to children who may not have a strong inclination towards the business. While Musk may have made mistakes in the past, his viewpoint on giving power to capable individuals rather than heirs makes a lot of sense.
In a recent interview at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council, the billionaire shared that he has already identified individuals capable of taking over his companies if he were unable to do so himself. However, he firmly believes that it is not right for executives to simply hand over their businesses or voting shares to their children.
""I am definitely not of the school of automatically giving my kids some share of the companies, even if they have no interest or inclination or ability to manage the company,"" Musk said. ""I think that's a mistake.""
Musk is known to have nine children, with the oldest being 19 years old. He frequently brings his 3-year-old son, X AE A-XII, to various events and even gave him his own special Twitter badge. However, no all children get along with Musk. Infact, his oldest daughter requested a name change, as she no longer wishes to associated with her father. The daughter identifies as a transgender.The 18-year-old stated that she no longer wished to be ""related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.""
The 18-year-old expressed her desire to completely sever ties with her biological father. In legal documents filed in a California court, she cited ""gender identity"" as another reason for changing her name. The teenager wants to be officially recognized as a female and go by her new name, which was not disclosed in the court documents, as reported by Reuters.Musk is known to be homophobic, he once poked fun at people who mention he/him on their bio. He has time and again made often of people belonging to the LGBTQ community.

: Reliance Jio is said to be in discussions with Tesla to build a private 5G network setup for the company's manufacturing plant. Reportedly, the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle manufacturer is trying to get the green signal to set up its first manufacturing base in India. Amidst all the talks, it is now said that Jio has offered to set up a private 5G network for Tesla's proposed manufacturing plant in India. The private 5G network would handle essential operations around the manufacturing plant at high speeds and support connected car solutions and automated production processes. 
A report by Financial Express suggests that the Mukesh Ambani-headed telco is in early talks with Tesla for the setup of the private network, and further progress will only happen if Tesla finalizes its plans to set up a manufacturing plant in the country. ""The talks between Jio and Tesla are at a preliminary stage, and any further developments are expected only when the latter firms up its plans for setting up a manufacturing unit in India,"" an unnamed industry source revealed to the publication. 
The report suggests that Jio is also reaching out to firms across automobile, healthcare, manufacturing, and other industries with possible use cases of 5G, offering to build and manage their private networks. The captive private 5G network setup from the telco will help these firms achieve high data speed and data carrying capacity within their premises, which is not possible if they depend on public networks. Notably, the private 5G solutions will also help industries benefit from the next technological advancement - Industry 4.0 - a new technology wave that is said to revolutionize the way companies manufacture, improve, and distribute their products. 
Well, Jio is not the first telco seeking opportunities with companies to build private 5G network setups. Earlier, in December 2022, Jio's rival Airtel announced its partnership with Tech Mahindra to set up 5G for the enterprise solution at Mahindra and Mahindra's Chakan facility. With this collaboration, the Chakan facility became the first 5G-enabled auto manufacturing unit in India. 
Now, with Jio trying to seize the opportunity to set up a private 5G network for Tesla, there will be intense momentum in the race among telcos and companies themselves to set up private networks to improve their operations. 
However, Jio's plans related to Tesla are currently awaiting Tesla's confirmation of its plans for establishing a manufacturing unit in the country. A report by Reuters revealed that Tesla officials recently visited India to discuss the plan regarding setting up manufacturing in India with Indian officials. The officials discussed the incentives for car and battery manufacturing with the Indian officials. 
It is worth noting that companies are not dependable on big telecom players for private network establishment. The government allows companies to buy spectrum and set up their own Wi-Fi and data network instead of relying on telecom services to get the network. Through this, the companies have more flexibility and control over their networks. However, telcos are not pleased with the flexibility and are opposing it. They say this will give technology companies an unfair advantage and make it difficult for telecom companies to compete.

It's poised to be the Hummer of the 2020s.,"The 
Tesla
 Cybertruck is going to change the 
electric pickup truck
 game. 
Tesla
 
 
 
Tesla is finally ready to enter the most lucrative vehicle segment in the 
US: pickup trucks
.
 
The long-awaited Cybertruck, which was 
revealed to much fanfare and with a shattered window in 2019
, is finally 
heading to production this year
. The Cybertruck's arrival is expected to shake up the electric pickup truck market – and the entire stalwart truck market – with its arresting design and high-tech features.
 
In the years since the Cybertruck reveal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has slowly dripped out details on the truck. He has previously claimed that the Cybertruck will be able to ""serve briefly as a boat,"" and feature rear-wheel steering. It's unclear how many of these promised features will reach final production, but experts say that it's always safe to say Tesla will push the boundaries on what their cars can do.
 
""This is a vehicle that competes against everybody and nobody,"" said Ivan Drury, an automotive analyst for car-shopping website Edmunds. ""If the Cybertruck comes to fruition looking like it did at the debut, that should be more than enough – everything else from tech and features is just icing on the cake.""
 
Earlier this week, Musk confirmed that the 
Cybertruck is slated to go on sale later this year
. It will be Tesla's first completely new product in three years, coming at a time when both Tesla and the pickup truck market writ large desperately need an injection of excitement and new ideas.
 
""This is an imperative move for Tesla to turn around the growing image that they're becoming a very traditional automaker,"" Drury said. From 
stale designs
 to 
discounts and incentives
, Tesla's critics have accused the company of losing its disruptor luster in the last year.
 
Cybertruck will be the Hummer of the 2020s
 
The boxy and futuristic design of the Cybertruck is unlike anything the automotive industry has ever seen, experts say. It's designed to appeal to a very specific type of status-seeker – video game enthusiasts, tech nerds, people who love 80s movies – as well as any drivers who want to turn heads on the street.
 
Creating a crazy-looking car for a new set of buyers is similar to what Hummer did for SUVs in the 90s, Drury said. 
 
Hummer was a giant, impractical vehicle with a tank-like design that became a status symbol. It turned a previously utilitarian SUV segment into a space where car companies could still attract enthusiasts and luxury-minded buyers.
 
""The Cybertruck is going to be the Hummer of the 2020s,"" Drury said. ""It's a car that's going to let people live out a new, bizarre dream of what their vehicle can be.""
 
Why rivals should both fear and revere the Cybertruck
 
If Tesla is about to redefine what a pickup truck can look like, and who it can appeal to, that's going to be huge for the pickup truck market. For years, this extremely lucrative market has played by strict rules for design, capability, and features in order to placate an extremely loyal buyer base. 
 
Only a disruptor like Tesla could change that playbook, said Karl Brauer, executive analyst for iSeeCars. 
 
""This is going to be an extremely disruptive moment for what is normally a very stable and conservative segment of the automotive market,"" Brauer said. ""This is going to be Tesla's take on the pickup truck, which is enough on its own, and competitors should be very wary of that.""
 
At the same time, he said, Tesla is likely to create entirely new truck buyers, attracting rabid Tesla fans who have never owned a pickup truck before as well as flashy buyers who want to be seen in a truck as unique as the Cybertruck, Brauer said. 
 
That is good for Tesla in the short term, as it guarantees buyers for this crucial product, but also a boon to the entire truck market. Shopping for a Cybertruck could turn a customer who never even considered buying a truck into someone who ends up test driving or buying an 
F-150
 Lightning, Brauer said.
 
""There's going to be a lot of reconsideration for people on these cars when the Cybertruck hits,"" he said.

The way drivers interact with self-driving systems such as Tesla's Autopilot system was a cause for concern, Pete Buttigieg said. 
 
""There is a real concern that's not limited to the technology, itself but the interaction between the technology and the driver,"" the Transportation Secretary said about investigations into Tesla's software at a 
news conference Tuesday
.
 
""The question is not are they absolutely free of problems or a thousand percent foolproof,"" Buttigieg added. ""The question is: how can we be sure that they will lead to a better set of safety outcomes?""
 
While self-driving technology had ""a lot of promise,"" he warned: ""We just have to make sure it unfolds in a responsible fashion.""
 
Tesla's Autopilot function is intended for use on highways, while Full Self-Driving mode can operate in urban settings and allows the vehicle to change lanes, recognize stop signs and 
traffic lights
, as well as park.
 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously said that the software would eventually be able to operate entirely autonomously and be 
safer than human drivers
. He's argued that 
fully self-driving cars
 represent Tesla's future.
 
The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
 has been 
looking into numerous crashes
 involving Tesla's advanced driver-assistance systems since 2021. In March 
the safety agency
 opened another investigation following reports that the steering wheel on 
Tesla's Model Y
 could fall off while being driven.
 
The 
NHTSA
 is also 
examining
 whether the driver of a Tesla that struck a high school student in April was using the assisted driving technology at the time. 
 
The NHTSA, Tesla, and Buttigieg's office didn't respond to requests for comment from Insider.

Elon Musk discussed everything from dogecoin and aliens to artificial intelligence and China-Taiwan tensions during the Wall Street Journal's 
CEO Council
 on Tuesday.
 
The centibillionaire CEO of Tesla, Twitter, and SpaceX hinted that he plans to challenge Microsoft and Google in the AI sphere, and complained about inertia in companies. He also shared his hopes for the next US president, warned humanity is getting cocky, and noted his children won't necessarily inherit stakes in his companies.
 
Here are Musk's 12 best quotes, lightly edited for length and clarity:
 
1. ""Sanity and stability will be prime requirements for traveling to Mars. You don't want someone going nuts and opening the airlock in the middle of the night.""
 
2. ""I frequently get asked, 'Have I seen any evidence of aliens?' and I have not — apart from the fact that I did at one point have an alien registration card when I was getting my green card.""
 
3. ""My preference, and what I think would be the preference of most Americans, is really to have someone fairly normal in office. I think we'd all be quite happy with that actually.""
 
4. ""We 
generally
 operate with too much of an assumption that civilization is robust, and nothing could really take it down — a sentiment that has been common throughout history among empires shortly before they crumbled. There's a little bit of late-stage empire vibes going on right now.""
 
5. ""I'm not advising anyone to buy a crypto, or bet the farm on dogecoin, or anything like that. Maybe you should, but let me advise you that would be perhaps unwise. Dogecoin is my favorite cryptocurrency because it has the best humor and has dogs.""
 
6. ""At any given company, there are people who help move things forward, and people who try to slam the 
brakes
. Twitter was in a situation where you'd have a meeting of 10 people — one person with an accelerator and nine with a set of brakes. So you didn't go very far.""
 
7. ""We've got OpenAI and Microsoft, Google DeepMind, and probably there should be a third horse in the race."" (Musk teased there will be more on that front from Tesla soon.)
 
8. ""It's very much a double-edged sword. If you have a genie that can grant you anything, that can also do anything, that necessarily presents a danger. I expect the first government uses of AI to be weapons technology."" (Musk was discussing the consequences of developing artificial superintelligence.)
 
9. ""There's a non-zero chance of it going Terminator. It's a small likelihood of of annihilating humanity. Or assuming control for the safety of all the humans, and taking over all the computing systems and weapon systems of Earth, and effectively being like some sort of uber nanny.""
 
10. ""There's a good chance push will come to shove. I dread to think what would happen, the results for the global economy would be absolutely catastrophic. 
China
 and Taiwan are like conjoined twins with the rest of the world from an economic standpoint. The separation is going to be dire indeed if it happens.""
 
11. ""Succession is one of the toughest, age-old problems. It's plagued countries, kings, prime ministers, presidents, and CEOs since the dawn of history. There is no obvious solution.""
 
12. ""I'm definitely not of the school of automatically giving my kids some share of the companies, even if they have no interest or inclination or ability to manage the companies. I think that's a mistake.""

High current rate charging causes inevitable severe heat generation, thermal inconsistency, and even thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries. Concerning this, a liquid cooling plate comprising a multi-stage Tesla valve (MSTV) configuration with high recognition in microfluidic applications was proposed to provide a safer temperature range for a prismatic-type lithium-ion battery. Meanwhile, a surrogate model with the objectives of the cooling performance and energy cost was constructed, and the impact of some influential design parameters was explored through the robustness analysis of the model. On this basis, the multi-objective optimization design of the neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm (NCGA) was carried out. The obtained results demonstrated that if the MSTV channel was four channels, the valve-to-valve distance was 14.79 mm, and the thickness was 0.94 mm, the cold plate had the most effective cooling performance and a lower pumping power consumption. Finally, the optimization results were verified by a numerical simulation and an experiment, and the performance evaluation was compared with the traditional serpentine channel. The results reported that the optimized design reduced the maximum temperature and standard surface standard deviation of the cold plate by 26% and 35%, respectively. The additional pump power consumption was 17.3%. This research guides the design of battery thermal management systems to improve efficiency and energy costs, especially under the high current rate charging conditions of lithium-ion batteries.


 










 


In recent years, there has been global energy reduction and environmental protection requirements to improve the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs). Among many kinds of power batteries, the lithium-ion battery has attracted increasingly more attention because of its advantages, such as high energy density, low self-discharge rate, and long cycle life. However, the heat generated in the charging and discharging process of lithium-ion batteries will affect the working performance of the battery. Too high a temperature will shorten the service life of the battery and may cause the battery to have thermal runaway or even an explosion [
1
]. This is also one of the problems that must be solved in the design and manufacture of EVs. Generally, the ideal operating temperature range of lithium-ion batteries is 20–45 °C, and the local surface standard deviation between the battery pack should generally be less than 5 °C [
2
]. Therefore, building a battery thermal management system (BTMS) with excellent performance and ensuring that lithium-ion batteries work in a proper temperature range is a prerequisite for ensuring the power performance and safety of EVs [
3
].
Currently, the research on battery thermal management systems is mainly focused on heat dissipation. The common cooling methods include forced air cooling, liquid cooling, phase change material (PCM) cooling, and heat pipe cooling [
4
]. The active indirect liquid cooling, as the mainstream battery thermal management system cooling solution, relies on the flow of coolant (e.g., water or water/glycol) into metal plates (internal flow channels called cold plates) to remove heat from the battery. Since the cold plate structure parameters have a large impact on the efficiency of the whole cooling system, the existing literature review reports mainly focus on many studies on different structures of cold plates using numerical analysis or algorithmic optimization design. Guo et al. [
5
] used numerical simulation and an orthogonal test of multiple indexes to optimize the structural parameters and flow rates of the parallel-spiral serpentine channel liquid cooling plate. The result indicates that the flow rate is the main factor affecting the maximum temperature as well as the temperature distribution, while the channel height has a strong influence on the pressure drop. Huang et al. [
6
] carried out numerical analysis on the cooling plate structure adopted when an actual battery module is undertaken and verified this by comparison with the experiment. On the basis of the thermal characteristics of the battery pack, three structural design schemes for the cooling plate were proposed and analyzed. Compared to the original design, the maximum field synergy angle was reduced by 7.25%, while the cooling efficiency factor was increased by 10.82% for the uneven heating condition of the battery pack. Xie et al. [
7
] proposed a simple cooling structure with a precisely tailored liquid cooling plate for the thermal management of a large battery module. When there is an aluminum plate thickness of 4 mm and an inlet velocity of 0.275 m∙s
−1
, the maximum temperature and maximum temperature difference of the battery module can be controlled below 31.80 and 3.70 °C, respectively. Li et al. [
8
] used the response surface methodology (RSM) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization of a mini U-channel cold plate with SiO
2
 nanofluid to obtain the best performance. According to the Pareto optimal solution, the optimal objective functions were

 = 2.66 K, and ΔP = 436.19 Pa. Zhai et al. [
9
] proposed a novel flow arrangement of staggered flow (the fluid staggers flow along each layer) to remove higher heat flux and obtain a more uniform bottom temperature in double-layered microchannel heat sinks. Compared to the counter flow, the heat transfer performance of two types of staggered flow was studied numerically. The distribution of total temperature, average bottom temperature, maximum temperature difference, and thermal resistance were presented for different flow arrangements under similar pumping power.
Obviously, the current main literature reports focus on the total thermal resistance and surface standard deviation as the two indexes of optimization of cold plate evaluation. The total thermal resistance indicates how much heat a radiator can carry away at a given surface standard deviation. However, it cannot evaluate the temperature uniformity of the battery. In addition, pump power usually increases when thermal resistance decreases. However, high inlet speed or high flow rate is a great challenge to drive pump loss [
10
]. This shows that it can only improve the heat transfer performance without considering the flow rate of the coolant, thus reducing the driving coolant pump dissipation efficiency and seriously affecting the temperature consistency of the battery module.
However, with the development of microelectronic heat dissipation components towards miniaturization and integration, their weight and size have always been a concern. Among them, the thermal conductive components with microchannel low flow resistance enhanced temperature control function are also widely used, and their thermal performance and pumping power consumption effect is far more than the level of conventional cooling means can achieve. Compared to the previous analysis of the current state of research, being based on Murray's law [
11
] and Bejan et al.'s [
12
] construction theory, the cold plate with microchannel structure was found to have a lower flow resistance and a more uniform temperature distribution on the heat dissipation surface, requiring less pumping energy. Moreover, similar design methods have been used in the battery thermal management system to promote a uniform temperature distribution in the battery module, thus avoiding thermal stress concentration and ensuring the efficiency of the overall battery module. He et al. [
13
] proposed a double-layered I-shaped liquid cooling plate to optimize the operating temperature of a 40Ah LiFePO
4
 battery using the design idea of construction theory. The optimized I-shaped liquid cooling plate can reduce the maximum temperature from 307.02 to 303.94 K and the standard deviation of surface temperature from 0.80 K to 0.25 K. In addition, the pressure drop was reduced by 73.36% compared to that in the serpentine channel. Qi et al. [
14
] proposed a Swiss-roll-type liquid cooling micro-channel to cope with the use of battery modules under high-rate discharge conditions. Compared with the serpentine flow channel BTMS optimized by other researchers, the maximum temperature and temperature difference of the Swiss roll battery module and the height of the cooling belt were reduced by 1.2 K and 0.2 K, respectively. Wu et al. [
15
] designed a microchannel flat-tube-assisted composite silica gel (CSG-LC) to improve the thermal uniformity and thermal stability performance of traditional cooling plates. It was found that the maximum temperature and maximum temperature difference could be controlled below 44.5 and 4.5 °C at a 3 C discharge rate, respectively.
On the basis of the above literature review, micro- or sub-micro-channels were used in the context of BTMS [
16
]. It has been widely reported that heat sinks with microchannels are commonly used to enhance the cooling of high heat flow regions [
17
]. To further challenge the heat transfer capacity of microchannels and the resulting pressure drop loss [
18
], new or refining existing microchannel design features are often used. Among them, the traditional Tesla valve is a typical improved fluid control system used to increase the mass transmission or heat transfer capacity of the system [
19
]. For instance, Sun et al. [
20
] designed microchannel heat sinks imitating the Tesla valve (MCTV), mounted with a sector bump (MCSB) and diamond bump (MCDB). The results show that the Nu of MCTV, MCSB, and MCDB were increased by 102.3%, 111.2%, and 94.8%, while the f of these structures were increased by 3.21 times, 3.14 times, and 2.81 times with a 
Re
 of 800, respectively. Bao et al. [
21
] proposed two improved parameters (relative pressure drop ratio and absolute pressure drop ratio) in order to make up for defect of diodicity. In addition, a novel Tesla valve with a special tapering/widening structure was designed, analyzed, and compared with other types of Tesla valves, showing a superior absolute pressure drop ratio. At the same time, the heat transfer performance of the Tesla valve was fully investigated, and the maximum temperature difference between forward and reverse flows can be 12.10 K, which has the potential to realize a new way for real-time thermal management. Li et al. [
22
] designed a 3D Tesla valve manifold two-phase cold plate for a SiC power device module. Through the cold plate top surface temperature distribution measurements, the temperature uniformity of each SiC diode on the Tesla valve cold plate could be maintained at ±5 °C.
Considering the aforementioned research works, it is understandable that most of the literature focuses on improving the existing channel layout and modifying the design features. Conversely, the temperature gradient is still greater than 5 °C as there exists a limitation in heat transfer coefficient enhancement. Unlike the formerly employed channel designs, the present work suggests a novel liquid cooling channel plate by utilizing the Tesla valve design that has grown to prominence in microfluidics, micro-pumps, microelectronics, fuel cell, and heat pipe systems. In addition, on the basis of our previous studies [
23
] on the flow direction of the Tesla valve, the heat transfer enhancement capability of the reverse flow is mainly caused by pressure duality caused by flow bifurcation, stagnation, and mixing mechanisms [
24
].
Therefore, this work aimed to design a new cold plate with the MSTV channel, relying on the heat transfer characteristics of the reverse flow of the Tesla valve channel. A high-precision battery thermal model was established through thermal characteristic experiments to provide a reference for the research of cooling system. Secondly, the performance optimization of MSTV-BTMS was carried out using the DoE, Kriging, and NCGA optimization algorithm framework. Factors affecting cell temperature such as coolant volume fraction and valve distance of MSTV channels and coolant inlet velocity, as well as the required pumping power of the cold plate, were included. A liquid cooling system with low temperature and low energy consumption was developed. Finally, the optimization results were verified by a combination of prot",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Fan,Fowler,Fraser,Panchal,Satyam Panchal,Wang,Xiao Xiong,Xiong,Yiwei Fan,Zhaohui Wang",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/processes/processes-11-01618/article_deploy/html/images/processes-11-01618-g001-550.jpg?1685024215,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,5.8074827,250a690e2a0fe7a7897a4f86ae7fad78

 to be specific, in white. The only option I selected was the white interior, which matches quite well with the slightly pearlescent exterior hue in my humble opinion. Now, before I go any further, I'd just like to point out that this is a product, not a statement. I bought a car, not a set of values. A means of transportation, not an announcement of my ideals. If you can't separate those two things, well, you probably already hold a steadfast opinion on the topic, and you may as well stop reading now.
 
Still with us? Alrighty then. I bought a 

 because it was the right choice for my family. I did not buy it because I like 
Elon Musk
 (more on that coming). I did not buy it because I believe Tesla is the segment leader in self-driving tech (I don't believe it is). I did not buy it because I believe everyone who 
buys a car
 powered by gasoline in 2023 is a bad person (they aren't).
 
First, it should be noted that this is primarily a car for my wife. In addition to being her primary set of wheels, it will also very likely displace the vast majority of trips taken in my primary car, a GMC 
Suburban
. 
Two cars for two drivers
, with the more efficient option being the one we'll choose to drive when shopping, visiting friends and family in the area, and for 
general
 around-town appointments and meanderings. The big-block 4x4 will be reserved for me when my wife has taken the Tesla already, or when we need to travel particularly long distances, and finally when we need to put half of our worldly possessions in a vehicle for any number of reasons (camping and vacationing in general being prime candidates).
 
After years of testing them, I knew an 
electric car
 would work very well for my family. We've discussed buying an EV several times in the past, and finally decided it was time to pull the trigger. I actually tried desperately to buy a Ford Lightning pickup 
truck
, but local dealers literally laughed at me when I asked how long I'd have to wait to get one at its sticker price. I called every dealer I could locate within 200 miles and not a single one I spoke with was willing to honor the MSRP. And then Ford jacked up the price. And then Ford jacked up the price again. The Lightning was now out of the running entirely.
 
As useful as a pickup truck may be
, I didn't need one. I have a very large SUV already, and trailers are easy to rent. So, why not choose a much more efficient sedan or hatchback design instead? I resisted considering a Tesla at first, for a wide variety of reasons that I'll discuss as this article goes on. 
 
Why didn't I want a Tesla to begin with?
 
First, I am not a fan of the way Elon Musk manages the company. I offer a hearty applause for Musk's contributions toward making Tesla the first successfully launched American car company in many, many decades. Past his role at the helm of Tesla, I find Musk at best a bore and at worst a nuisance. I don't find him humorous. I don't appreciate his constant meme-driven Twitter feed, his constant need to make his opinions publicly broadcast or his controversial rhetoric.
 
From his insistent childishness – always focusing on the numbers 420 and 69; using S, 3, X and Y as model names that spell SEXY; painting over the ‘w' on Twitter's HQ so it instead reads ‘Titter', using terms like ""pedo guy"" ... the list goes on – to the brazenness and morally questionable decision to sell (at a very high cost) 'Beta' self-driving software that operates on public roads alongside human beings who were not offered a choice to 'opt-in' as part of the test, I'm quite comfortable saying Elon Musk was a major detraction for me and my family when considering a new vehicle. 
Not that he cares
. I also wish Tesla at least occasionally hit a production target date or price point.
 
Expanding on Tesla's self-driving ambitions, I feel very strongly that it's morally irresponsible to use public roads as grounds to refine software. It's one thing for me or another human being to decide they are fine with beta testing untested software. It's another thing entirely to test that software out in the real world alongside people who weren't given the same choice. I will never use Tesla's Full Self Driving technology package as long as it's in Beta form, and I certainly will not pay the current $15,000 asking price for the privilege. The $6,000 Enhanced Autopilot package is much more reasonable, and it can be added at any time even after delivery.
 
Moving on to the car itself, I don't think the bare-bones aesthetic of the Model 3's interior is a positive. I'm particularly irritated by the centrally located touchscreen. Not only is it necessary to use the screen for just about everything, its also placed in a spot that sometimes interferes with my knee space while driving.
 
 
Why did I end up buying a  anyway?
 
For starters it was the 
best deal
, by far. Once Tesla started knocking thousands of dollars off the car's starting price, competitors like the 
Kia EV6
, Hyundai Ioniq 5, 
Ford Mustang Mach-E
 and 
Volkswagen ID.4
 started to look a wee bit expensive. I paid extra for the white interior, but pretty much everything a modern car needs to have comes standard. We also considered every available plug-in hybrid but ruled every one of them out 
either because of price
 or because 
they'd still end up spending too much time running on gasoline
, thereby defeating the purpose of our decision to buy an EV. 
 
After much deliberation, we had very nearly decided to buy a very low-mileage 
BMW i3
 REX with a 
certified pre-owned
 warranty. 
I wanted the sportier S trim
, and in this lone instance the small gasoline-fueled generator was a bonus, not a drawback. We cast a very wide net, finally found the perfect 
i3
 about five hours away and made plans to go look at it. And then I remembered that the Model 3's price, brand new, had been dropped into the same bracket as the used BMW. At today's prices, 
the Model 3 I bought costs $42,880
 including all ordering and destination fees. The Tesla would have a longer warranty, more range and sportier dynamics. It would also have access to the Supercharger network. So we decided to make a trip to the Tesla showroom about 30 minutes away to take a look.
 
The Model 3 drives very well
, feels quite solid and offers a firm but comfortable ride. Acceleration from the electric drivetrain is good – Tesla quotes a 5.8-second 0-60 run and a top speed of 140 miles per hour – and 272 miles of range is plenty for the type of driving we bought it for. The 3's heated seats are clad in a soft faux leather, the glass roof lends an airy feeling to the cabin, and outward visibility is very good. All the desirable safety stuff is included in the base price, and crash tests prove the car to be sturdily designed and built. Storage space is solid, and the back seat, even though we don't often use it, is relatively roomy and comfortable. I also was happy to find that the base Model 3 uses a cobalt-free lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry. 
 
I was very concerned about build quality, but those concerns proved premature. The Model 3 I ordered and received is screwed and glued together just as well as any other new car I've driven, with reasonable body gaps and no discernible squeaks or rattles. We took it on an in-state 
road trip
 a week after purchasing it and found the range estimate to be reassuringly accurate. The car is quiet on the road, boasts a sporty driving position and surefooted handling to match. I also think the Model 3 is attractive (to my eyes, the design doesn't translate nearly as well to the more bulbous 
Model Y
).
 
 
The benefits of Tesla's Supercharger network cannot be overlooked. There are lots of 
chargers
 in my general vicinity, and even though over 90% of my charging needs are covered at home, the speed and ease of use compared to EVGo or Electrifiy America makes Tesla's charging solutions vastly superior to anything else on the market. Pull up to the charger, plug it in and, presto, you're charging. Payment is automatically made through an app. It really couldn't be easier, and it's a massive advantage that Tesla currently enjoys.
 
The  is a product, and it's a good one. It was the right choice for my family, so a shiny white EV now sits in my driveway. I also don't like the way Apple runs its business or many of the decisions Google makes that hurt the publishers the search giant relies on for content. And yet I'm typing this on a MacBook and use Google search in a Chrome browser daily.
 
Not everyone will agree, but for me and my family, we decided that it's possible to buy a Tesla without drinking the Kool-Aid.",autoblog.com,1835,news,GB,en,Jeremy Korzeniewski,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2023/05/31092953/tesla-model-3-white-white.jpg,False,@therealautoblog,9.168723,45208a84c7bfafd97c07df4fc1fa0e52

SHANGHAI -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk paid an early morning visit to the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory on Thursday during his trip in China, and lauded the plant for its production efficiency and quality.
 
Musk congratulated the Chinese team for their amazing work and the ""positive energy of getting things done."" ""It's been incredibly impressive how you have been able to overcome so many difficulties and so many challenges,"" he said.
 
""Throughout the world, the cars we produce here are not just the most efficient reproduction, but also the highest quality,"" Musk added.
 
Shanghai Gigafactory was viewed as a ""role model"" for Tesla's other factories across the world, as Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas, which were opened last year, are ""replicating"" its efficiency and industrial influence on a global scale.
 
Tesla's Shanghai plant delivered 710,000 vehicles in 2022, an increase of 48 percent from 2021.
 
Established in 2019, the Tesla Gigafactory in Shanghai is the carmaker's first Gigafactory outside the United States.
 
The US carmaker announced in April that it will build a new mega factory in Shanghai, which will be dedicated to manufacturing the company's energy-storage product Megapack.
 
The new plant is scheduled to break ground in the third quarter of this year and start production in the second quarter of 2024.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202306/02/6479767ea3107584e5948388.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,8.700917,63d76daf448f336024e4c9ef06016f51

Tesla's price war in China
 is hitting one EV tycoon's fortune hard. 
 
He Xiaopeng, the 45-year-old billionaire cofounder, chairman, and CEO of China's electric vehicle maker Xpeng, is now worth $1.4 billion after his wealth tanked by 75% from its 2021 peak, according to 
Forbes.
 
Forbes did not specifically state how it 
calculated
 He's wealth. The tycoon owns 20.5% of Xpeng class A shares as of December 31, 2022, per a 
regulatory filing
 made public in February. 
 
Despite the wealth wipeout, He is still the 2,048th richest person in the world — although his net worth is now just a quarter of his $5.5 billion wealth in 2021, per Forbes.
 
Xpeng shares have seen massive swings this year, last coming under pressure after the company released disappointing 
first-quarter earnings last Wednesday
 — the company's revenues dropped 50% from a year ago to 4.03 billion Chinese yuan, or $569 million.
 
The Alibaba-backed company's first-quarter net loss also widened to 2.34 billion yuan from 1.7 billion yuan a year ago.
 
The Xpeng P7 
sports sedan
 is the company's bestseller to date, according to a 
Wired report in February.
 The EV maker launched its first mass-produced model, the 
G3
, in 2018.

Xpeng's results came amid an intense price war in China's EV sector 
triggered by Tesla.
 
Yale Zhang, a Shanghai-based managing director at consultancy Automotive Foresight, told 
Forbes
 that 
Tesla's
 30,000 yuan price cut in China ratcheted the EV war in China, particularly for domestic brands.
 
Xpeng followed suit, but its price cuts did not appeal to buyers who prefer to 
buy cars
 made by Tesla or Warren Buffet-backed 
BYD
 as they are more popular, Wang Hanyang, a Shanghai-based analyst at 
86
 , told 
Forbes.
 
China is Tesla's second-largest market after the US and important one for the American EV maker. Tesla CEO 
Elon Musk
 is set to visit China this week for the first time in three years, 
Reuters
 reported on Monday. It's not clear who he would meet and what they will discuss, per Reuters.
 
Xpeng still has big plans ahead. It 
rolled
 out a 
new electric SUV
 in April and has been expanding aggressively in Europe, starting with 
Norway in December 2020.
 
Xpeng co-president Brian Gu told 
CNBC in November 2021
 that it eventually wants to ship half its vehicles to countries outside China. He did not provide a time frame for the goal.
 
""As a company that focuses on global opportunities, we want to be balanced with our contribution of delivery — half from China, half from outside China — in the long run,"" Gu told the network.
 
The New York Stock Exchange-listed Xpeng stock closed 2.4% higher at $8.20 on Friday. They are 18% lower so far this year and down 64% from a year ago. 
 
The US markets were closed on Monday for a public holiday.
 
Xpeng's shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are up 0.2% on Tuesday at midday. They are down 19% this year.
 
Xpeng did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

China
 was the biggest market for 
Tesla's Model Y
 electric 
sport utility vehicles
, helping it become the world's top selling vehicle in the first quarter of this year, according to data from market research firm JATO shared with Reuters.
 
Elon Musk
 on Tuesday visited China for the first time in three years, highlighting the importance of the world's biggest electric market.
 
Tesla
 sold 267,171 Model Ys in the first quarter of this year, of which 94,469 were sold in China, higher than 83,664 in the United States and 71,114 in Europe, according the data. Overall, the United States was the biggest market for Tesla, which does not provide regional breakdown of its global sales.
 
Model Y
 ranked first in global sales, followed by the 
Toyota Corolla
, 
Toyota
 Hilux, Toyota Rav4 and 
Toyota Camry
, according to the data. Model Y is the only pure 
electric car
 in the list.
 
Musk recently told CNBC that growing tensions between China and the United States ""should be a concern for everyone."" Tesla also recently held talks with Indian officials about building a new factory in India.
 
JATO Senior Analyst Felipe Munoz expects the Model Y will be the world's top-seller by the year-end in 2023 because of price cuts that enable the model to access the benefits of public incentives for EVs.
 
More production from Tesla's new plants in Texas and Berlin and easing supply chain issues, as well as increasing EV demand in the developed economies, should also buoy Model Y sales, he said.
 
Unlike many automakers, Tesla has a limited number of models and their variants, which helped the Model Y become the biggest seller.
 
Barclays analyst Dan Levy said there are concerns about Tesla being too reliant on just two models, Model Y and 
Model 3
, adding Tesla may need more models and variants to expand its market.
 
Tesla this year aggressively cut prices, underscoring intense competition especially in the SUV segment, where Tesla's aging Model Y faces a range of newer rivals, according to 
Ford
 CEO Jim Farley.

(Image source: Tesla)
Professional driver Misha Charoudin has put the Tesla Model S Plain through its paces on the Nürburgring and found the car lacking. Charoudin dubbed Tesla's sports car ""Dangerously fast and unstable,"" on account of its incredible power output paired with less-than-adequate suspension and braking hardware. The very nature of an electric vehicle drivetrain means these criticisms are likely applicable to many performance EVs currently on the market. 
E-Mobility
 
Review Snippet






Misha Charoudin's Tesla Model S Plaid 
review
 on the Nürburgring has brought up some concerning issues with Tesla's flagship performance vehicle. The performance issues in question, although very clear in the case of the Model S, are likely pervasive throughout the electric vehicle market. 


Charoudin raises concerns about the vehicle's stability and handling, especially under acceleration, claiming the vehicle behaved unpredictably and dangerously under hard acceleration. Not only does the vehicle struggle to accelerate and corner confidently and predictably, thanks to the soft stock suspension lightening the steering excessively, the stock brakes are also ill-advised in a track setting outside a test lap or two. 


The complaints don't stop at the vehicle's undercarriage hardware, though, with Tesla's infamous yoke taking heat for being uncomfortable and too wide to steer safely. He also noted that the seats, while comfortable, aren't exactly what you'd want for the track. 


While these issues are certainly relevant to any Model S Plaid owner, it's worth noting that they are of most concern for those looking to do long track days with the Model S Plaid, and owners of many premium electric vehicles at this point. Electric vehicles are notoriously 
heavier
 than their ICE counterparts — with even the Nissan Leaf coming in at a weighty 3,516 - 3,934 lbs, or around 1,000 lbs more than a Honda Civic — meaning they're inevitably going to be more difficult to stop and require more grip to steer in high-speed scenarios, given the road-oriented suspension and brakes on most EVs. 


While it's true that anyone looking to take a car to a track for any extended periods of time should look into aftermarket brakes and suspension, the argument for doing such is even stronger for EV owners, especially considering the readily-available power of an electric motor. 


Charoudin is hopeful that the 
Tesla Model S Plaid Track Package
, with its upgraded brake system, wheels, and tires, will improve the track performance, but the Track Package notably doesn't address the vehicle's suspension components or steering.

Cercospora leaf spot disease is a serious problem for lettuce cultivation worldwide. 
Cercospora lactucae-sativa,
 the causative agent of leaf spot disease on lettuce, was treated with non-thermal atmospheric pressure gliding arc (GA), tesla coil (TC) and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas for the in vitro fungal inactivation of both mycelial growth and conidial germination. The fungus was exposed to the three plasmas individually for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min. The results showed that DBD plasma inactivated fungal growth during all exposure periods, and the highest inhibitory effect was caused by exposure to DBD plasma for 20 min, at 93.33% inhibition. The germination of fungal conidia was completely inactivated after exposure to all three non-thermal plasmas for 5 min, as observed 4 and 24 h after incubation. The pathogenesis of 
C. lactucae-sativa
 on lettuce after plasma treatments for 5 min was examined by spraying an inoculation of the treated conidia on lettuce. The results showed that all three plasmas reduced the disease incidence and severity compared to the non-treated control. Therefore, the non-thermal atmospheric pressure GA, TC and DBD plasmas have antifungal potential for the inactivation of 
C. lactucae-sativa
, making them an interesting novel technology for plant disease control.


 










 


Lettuce (
Lactuca sativa
 L.) is one of the most economically important vegetable plants worldwide, and it is the most popular salad vegetable in Thailand [
1
]. The cultivation and production of lettuce are often obstructed by a leaf spot disease caused by 
Cercospora lactucae-sativa
 [
1
,
2
]. Leaf spot disease is a common and destructive disease of lettuce that occurs mostly during the rainy season and leads to high yield losses of up to 80% [
3
]. Infection begins on the lower, older leaves and progresses to the younger leaves through the penetration of the fungal hyphae via leaf stomata. The lesions are light to dark brown and further characterized by light ash to white-colored spots and, later, holes in the leaves, a symptom unique to 
C. lactucae-sativa
 on lettuce [
4
]. 
C. lactucae-sativae
 is a slow-growing hemibiotrophic fungus with a narrow host range restricted to brassicaceae plants [
4
,
5
].
To control leaf spot disease, fungicides are routinely used. However, fungicide usage has harmful effects and leaves residues on plants, humans and the environment [
6
]. Recently, non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology usage has expanded to new biological areas of application for the inactivation of harmful microorganisms, the preparation of ready-to-eat food and biofilm degradation, or in healthcare, the treatment of cancer cells, the initiation of apoptosis, prion inactivation, the prevention of nosocomial infections and the therapy of infected wounds [
7
,
8
].
Plasma is an ionized gas, referred to as the fourth state of matter [
7
]. Plasma is a neutrally charged collection of ions, electrons, photons and atoms in their fundamental or excited states [
9
]. The plasma state can be produced by applying a high electric voltage to gas. Then, reactive species consisting of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), charged species, UV radiation, free electrons and an electric field are generated in the plasma state, and these components can greatly affect biological processes [
10
].
Plasmas can be classified according to their temperature into two large groups: thermal plasmas and cold plasmas [
11
]. More specifically, low-temperature plasma can be distinguished into thermal plasma and non-thermal plasma (NTP) based on thermodynamic equilibrium [
7
]. NTP can be generated by different discharge configurators, such as atmospheric uniform glow, corona, dielectric barrier discharge, gliding arc, micro- hollow cathode, plasma jet and needle, by passing gases through electric fields [
12
]. The lethality of NTP depends on various processing variables, including input power (voltage and frequency), treatment time, gas type, flow rate and exposure mode. Higher frequencies and input voltages have been related to greater inactivation efficacy of NTP [
13
].
Gliding arc (GA) plasma is a hybrid plasma in which discharge takes place and is carried out between two divergent horn-like electrodes. Gliding arc plasma is produced as a low-impedance heat arc discharge at the narrow gap; it is then prolonged by the gas flow and quenched into a non-thermal plasma. The plasma cools down at the wide gap because no further discharge can take place. Accordingly, the primary plasma column disappears, and the travel cycle for the new plasma column is repeated [
14
].
Tesla coil (TC) is a self-resonance, self-breakdown discharge. The sharp electrode end generates a series of brief, transient pulses of electrical discharge to the surrounding gas; this is a short-lived phenomenon with a continuous cycle. Typically, it is much more efficient in gas dissociation with transient plasmas than with homogeneous plasmas [
15
].
Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma at atmospheric pressure is generally a nonuniform filamentary discharge. The formation and development of electric streamers arise from separated local sites of the dielectric barrier. Each streamer represents a so-called microdischarge, which is distributed in the gap and is unstable, moving around erratically [
16
].
NTPs in atmospheric pressure have been used for agricultural applications such as decontamination or inactivation of microorganisms in seeds, postharvest products, the plant tissue culture process, pork cuts and chicken meat, and the decontamination of pesticide residues [
17
,
18
,
19
,
20
,
21
]. The antimicrobial activity of NTP is associated with the generation of high concentrations of ROS during the discharge process; these ROS consist of superoxide (O
2
•
), hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
) which are toxic to microbial cells and cause oxidation of their macromolecules, thereby resulting in cell death [
22
]. In this study, we applied and compared three non-thermal plasmas, GA, TC and DBD, for the inactivation of 
C. lactucae-sativa
 in laboratory conditions and observed the resulting fungal pathogenicity after plasma treatments.
C. lactucae-sativa
 (GenBank accession no. OQ566288) was isolated from infected green oak lettuce collected from the cultivation area in Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand, using a single-spore isolation method on a potato dextrose agar (PDA). To identify fungal species, fungal DNA was extracted from mycelia using a Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (blood/cultured cell/fungus) (column-based) (Bio-Helix, New Taipei City, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to amplify the transition elongation factor 1-alpha (
TEF-1α
) gene [
23
] using 2X PCR SuperMix (Bio-Helix, New Taipei City, Taiwan). The PCR product was purified using a PCR Clean Up and Gel Extraction Kit (Bio-Helix, New Taipei City, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequence was directly analyzed using fluorescent dye terminator sequencing on ABI PrismTM 3730xI DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The obtained sequence was analyzed and aligned using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and deposited into the GenBank database.
To induce fungal sporulation, the mycelial discs were inoculated by placing them on lettuce leaves, followed by incubation in the growth chamber at 25 °C, 80% relative humidity (RH), and a photoperiod of 12 h in the light and 12 h in the dark for 14 days. The conidia were collected from the inoculated leaves by scraping the conidia produced on the leaves into autoclaved distilled water and counting the conidial concentration using a haemacytometer.
Ambient air reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) were generated using GA, TC and DBD plasmas in a semi-closure frame, as shown in 
Figure 1
.
The GA and TC plasmas were individually driven by a 20 W RF self-resonance power supply. The driver can supply a sinusoidal AC output with a peak voltage (Vp) of 6–10 kV at a frequency of 700–900 kHz. Meanwhile, the DBD plasma was driven by a continuous 18 W AC high-voltage source of 7.6 kVpp with a repetition rate of 18.2 kHz. The planar mesh-powered electrode was configured on an alumina ceramic sheet of a 1.0 mm thickness with lateral dimensions of 5.3 cm × 11.3 cm.
Thus, the ambient air molecules (N
2
 and O
2
) were ionized and dissociated by these strong electric fields, which induced the RONS with high-energy electrons in the plasma phase. The ionization and dissociation equation could be found in the reaction below (Equation (1)). However, the direct electron impact dissociation of N
2
 is much slower than that of O
2
, and so the major intermediate product is the atomic oxygen O
∙
. The electron collision with N
2
 leads preferentially to the formation of various excited N
2
* molecules, while the generation of RONS follows in the plasma propagation phase (Equations (2)–(7)) [
24
]. In humid air, electron impact can also produce atomic oxygen (O) and OH through dissociative excitation (Equation (8)). Both O and OH are transient chemical species that have very strong oxidative properties compared to neutral oxidant molecules such as ozone.

The spread plate method was applied for conducting in vitro inactivation instead of using mycelial discs due to the very slow growth rate of 
C. lactucae-sativa
 [
4
]. A total of 5 mycelial discs were added to a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of autoclaved distilled water; they were mixed by vortexing and then incubated at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C) overnight to increase fungal mass. The spread plate method was applied using 200 µL of fungal suspension, and the PDA plates were exposed to GA, TC and DBD plasmas for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min, after which the plates were incubated at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C) for 7 days. Each treatment contained three replicates, and the experiment was repeated 3 times. The diameter of the clear zone was recorded. The percent inhibition of mycelial growth was calculated according to the modified formula of [
25
] (Equation (9)), as follows:
where 
dc
 is the colony diameter of the non-treated control (9 cm) and 
dt
 is the value of the fungal growing area (9 cm clear zone (cm)) in each plasma-treated case.
To study the effect of GA, TC and DBD plasmas on the inactivation of conidial germination, the conidia of 
C. lactucae-sativa
 were collected from inoculated lettuce leaves and adjusted to a concentration of 10
6
 conidia/mL using a hemacytometer under a compound microscope. Some 100 µL of conidial suspension was dropped onto a slide culture before exposure to the GA, TC and DBD plasmas for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min. The slide culture was incubated at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C). Conidial germination was observed at 4 and 24 h after incubation. The non-treated conidia were used as a positive control. Each treatment contained three replicates (20 conidia/replicate), and the experiment was repeated three times. The percent inhibition of conidial germination was calculated according to the formula of [
26
] (Equation (10)), as follows:
where 
gc
 is the number of germinated conidia in the non-treated control and 
gt
 is the number of germinated conidia in each plasma-treated case.
To evaluate the antifungal efficacy of non-thermal atmospheric pressure GA, TC and DBD plasmas on the inactivation of 
C. lactucae-sativa
 pathogenesis, conidia were prepared, as previously described in 
Section 2.4
, and exposed to all plasmas for 5 min. Green oak lettuce (
Lactuca sativa
) was grown in a 5-inch pot containing approximately 200 g peat moss as a growing medium. The plasma-treated conidia were sprayed on all the lettuce leaves at the age of 14 days (5 mL/plant). The plants were covered with plastic bags and kept in a growth chamber at 25 °C, 80% RH, and underwent a photoperiod of 12 h in the light and 12 h in the dark for 14 days. Each treatment contained nine replications (plants). The disease incidence was recorded and calculated according to [
27
] (Equation (11)), as follows:
Disease severity was assessed after 14 days of inoculation using the scale reported by [
27
] as follows: 0 = no spots; 1 = 1–20% spots; 2 = 21–40% spots; 3 = 41–60% spots; 4 = 61–80% spots; and 5 = 81–100% spots. The disease severity index was then determined using the formula from [
27
] (Equation (12)), as follows:
All data in the present study were analyzed using Statistix version 8 (Analytical Software, Tallahassee, FL, USA). Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a least significant difference (LSD) test (
p
 < 0.05). Each treatment had three biological replicates. All data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD).
A 3-in-1 plasma device, composed of GA, TC and DBD plasmas, was devised (
Figure 1
a–d). Optical emission spectra with an acquisition time of 100 ms were used to identify the aforementioned species inside the plasmas, GA, TC and DBD, respectively. Groups of NO A–X were found in the ultraviolet range between 200 and 300 nm and OH at 308.98 nm, N
2
 at 336.61 nm, 357.17 nm (second positive band) and 379.99 nm (first negative band). Comparing the types of plasma, TC produced the highest concentration of air plasma radicals followed by a gliding arc and a dielectric barrier discharge. The difference in the intensity of plasma-generated species is clearly notable in the GA and TC over the DBD as the first two types are point sources, whereas DBD is a planar source (

The valveless micropump based on dual synthetic jets is a potential fluid pumping device that has the ability to transport fluid continuously. In order to improve the performance of this device, a novel valveless continuous micropump based on dual synthetic jets with a Tesla structure was proposed by combining a double Tesla symmetrical nozzle and a dual synthetic jets actuator. The mechanism of the novel micropump and its flow field characteristics were analyzed, combined with numerical simulation and a PIV experiment. The performance of the novel micropump was compared with that of a dual synthetic jet micropump based on a traditional shrinking nozzle. The novel micropump achieved continuous flow with a larger and more stable flow rate in one cycle. The maximum pump flow speed reached 12 m/s. Compared with the traditional type, the pump flow rate was increased by 5.27% and the pump flow pulsation was reduced by 214.93%. The backflow and vortex inside the nozzle were prevented and inhibited effectively by the Tesla structure. The velocity and influence range of the pump flow increased with the intensification of driving voltage in a certain range.

SHANGHAI - Tesla's Shanghai plant delivered 77,695 vehicles in May, soaring 142 percent year-on-year, said the company.
 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk paid a visit to the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory earlier this month during his trip to China, and lauded the plant for its production efficiency and quality.
 
Established in 2019, the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory in East China is the carmaker's first Gigafactory outside the United States.
 
In April 2023, the US carmaker announced another big investment in Shanghai -- the construction of a new mega factory dedicated to manufacturing the company's energy-storage product Megapack.
 
The new factory will initially produce 10,000 Megapack units every year, equal to approximately 40 GWh of energy storage. Its products are expected to be sold worldwide, said the company.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,王俊伟,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202306/05/647df388a31033ad342a774c.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,7.9982004,9200129a8fdecec19ed98003017285c5
423,Tesla stock jumps on EV charging tie-up with GM,Reuters,2023-06-09 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/06/09/tesla-stock-jumps-on-ev-charging-tie-up-with-gm/,autoblog.com,Tesla shares jumped on expectations that its charging system would become an industry standard after GM agreed to use the Tesla Supercharger network.,"shares jumped 5% on Friday on expectations that its electric-vehicle charging system would become an industry standard after 
General Motors joined
 cross-town 
rival Ford
 in agreeing to use the  Supercharger network. 
 
The Elon Musk-led automaker was on course for its eleventh straight session of gains, which would mark its longest winning streak in 2-1/2 years, if premarket gains hold.  was also the third-most traded U.S. stock across exchanges. 
 
Already the world's most valuable automaker,  was set to increase its market value by more than $30 billion to about $780 billion. 
 
Shares of 
General Motors
, whose valuation is much lower at $49.8 billion but sells millions more vehicles annually, rose 3.5%. 
 
The rare partnership among the automakers ensures that nearly 70% of the U.S. EV market will now be on 's North American Charging Standard, which is expected to put pressure on other companies to ditch the current industry-standard CCS and build out their networks using 's system. 
 
""We estimate 
Ford
 and 
GM
 combined could add another $3 billion to services EV charging revenue for  over the next few years in another accretive poker move by Musk & Co,"" said analysts at Wedbush Securities, raising their price target on 's shares to $300. 
 
That is nearly 30% higher than 's last close. The stock's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 60.46, compared with GM's 5.29 and Ford's 7.94. 
 
The brokerage added that the move will also ""aid GM's objective to expand charging access to more than 134,000 
chargers
 available to GM EV drivers today through the company's Ultium Charge 360 initiative and mobile apps"".

424,GM's electric vehicles will gain access to Tesla's vast charging network,Tom Krisher,2023-06-09 00:00:00,date,https://www.dailyherald.com/business/20230609/gms-electric-vehicles-will-gain-access-to-teslas-vast-charging-network,dailyherald.com,Electric vehicles made by General Motors will be able to use much of Tesla's extensive charging network beginning early next year.,"DETROIT -- Electric vehicles made by General Motors will be able to use much of Tesla's extensive charging network beginning early next year.
 
In addition, GM will adopt Tesla's connector, the plug that links an electric vehicle to a charging station.
 
GM joins Ford in shifting its electric vehicles to work with about 12,000 of Tesla's roughly 17,000 chargers, and both Detroit automakers are pushing to make Tesla's connector the industry standard. GM CEO Mary Barra and her Tesla counterpart, Elon Musk, made the announcement Thursday during a Twitter Spaces conversation.
 
Their discussion comes two weeks after Ford CEO Jim Farley joined Musk to announce that Ford's electric vehicles would gain access to much of Tesla's EV-charging network, the largest in the nation. Farley also said Ford would switch to Tesla's connector rather than go with the connector used by the rest of the industry.
 
Before the opening bell Friday, shares of Tesla Inc. jumped 6% and appeared headed for a new high for the year. General Motors Co. rose 4%, and Ford Motor Co. rose more than 1%.
 
At first, GM and Ford EV owners will need an adapter to hook into the Tesla stations, which have their own connector. But both GM and Ford will switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard connector starting with new EVs produced in 2025.
 
 
 
 
by signing up you agree to our 
terms of service
 
 
 
 
Tesla has about 17,000 Supercharger stations in the U.S. There are about 54,000 public charging stations in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy, but many charge much more slowly than the Tesla stations.
 
""Like Ford, we see this as an opportunity to expand access to charging,"" Barra said, adding that GM hopes the rest of the industry will move to the Tesla charging connector, which is different from the CCS connector used on most other EVs.
 
Musk said that GM and Tesla vehicles would have an even playing field at the charging stations.
 
""We will provide support equally to both,"" he said. ""The most important thing is we advance the electric vehicle revolution.""
 
Financial details of the agreement between the two companies were not released Thursday, but GM spokesman Darryll Harrison said GM isn't paying Tesla.
 
""Tesla will get better utilization of their network and all the new charging revenue, which will help them expand the network further,"" Harrison said. ""There are other opportunities both companies can take advantage of as a result of the agreement.""
 
Details of how customers would gain access are still being worked out. GM EV owners may have to pay a monthly charge to access Tesla's charging network, or they could pay for each use. Current GM owners probably will need to buy the adapter, Harrison said.
 
Tesla's supercharger network is a huge competitive advantage for the company based in Austin, Texas, which sells more EVs than anyone else in the U.S. Chargers often are located near freeways to enable long trips, where most fast-charging plugs are needed, and generally they're more reliable than other networks.
 
But opening access to EVs from GM and Ford, which rank a distant second and third in U.S. EV sales, will make it easier for those owners to charge while traveling. It also could rankle some Tesla owners who already are jockeying for space at some of the busier Supercharger stations, largely in California.
 
Barra said joining Tesla's network would almost double the number of chargers available to GM electric vehicle owners.
 
""At the end of the day, we're looking at what's best for our customers,"" Barra said. ""We aren't the only company that comes up with good ideas.""
 
Mike Austin, an electric vehicles analyst for Guidehouse Insights, said GM joining the Tesla network is a huge step toward making Tesla's connector the industrywide standard.
 
""It seems like there's a lot of momentum going the way of the North American Charging Standard, for sure,"" he said.
 
If other large EV makers such as Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen and Nissan, also switch connectors, Tesla would get a large amount of revenue from its chargers, Austin said.
 
Still, Tesla appears to be holding back at least part of its network for use only by Tesla owners, he said. The risk, he said, is that Tesla owners could have to wait for access to a plug.
 
""Tesla owners are used to not having to wait,"" he said.
 
The Tesla connector and cord are much lighter and easier to handle than the CCS system used by the rest of the auto industry, Austin said.
 
Earlier this year, the White House announced that at least 7,500 chargers from Tesla's Supercharger and Destination Charger network would be available to non-Tesla electric vehicles by the end of 2024.

SAN FRANCISCO — The school bus was displaying its stop sign and flashing red warning lights, a police report said, when Tillman Mitchell, 17, stepped off one afternoon in March. Then a Tesla Model Y approached on North Carolina Highway 561.
 
The car - allegedly in Autopilot mode - never slowed down.
 
It struck Mitchell at 45 mph. The teenager was thrown into the windshield, flew into the air and landed face down in the road, according to his great-aunt, Dorothy Lynch. Mitchell's father heard the crash and rushed from his porch to find his son lying in the middle of the road.
 
'If it had been a smaller child,' Lynch said, 'the child would be dead.'
 
The crash in North Carolina's Halifax County, where a futuristic technology came barreling down a rural highway with devastating consequences, was one of 736  crashes since 2019 involving Teslas in Autopilot mode - far more than previously reported, according to a Washington Post analysis of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data. The number of such crashes has surged over the past four years, the data shows, reflecting the hazards associated with increasingly widespread use of Tesla's futuristic driver-assistance technology as well as the growing presence of the cars on the nation's roadways.
 
The number of deaths and serious injuries associated with Autopilot also has grown significantly, the data shows. When authorities first released a partial accounting of accidents involving Autopilot in June 2022, they counted only three deaths definitively linked to the technology. The most recent data includes at least 17 fatal incidents, 11 of them since last May, and five serious injuries.
 
Mitchell survived the March crash but suffered a fractured neck and a broken leg and had to be placed on a ventilator. He still suffers from memory problems and has trouble walking. His great-aunt said the incident should serve as a warning about the dangers of the technology.
 
'I pray that this is a learning process,' Lynch said. 'People are too trusting when it comes to a piece of machinery.'
 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that cars operating in Tesla's Autopilot mode are safer than those piloted solely by human drivers, citing crash rates when the modes of driving are compared. He has pushed the carmaker to develop and deploy features programmed to maneuver the roads - navigating stopped school buses, fire engines, stop signs and pedestrians - arguing that the technology will usher in a safer, virtually accident-free future. While it's impossible to say how many crashes may have been averted, the data shows clear flaws in the technology being tested in real time on America's highways.
 
Tesla's 17 fatal crashes reveal distinct patterns, The Post found: Four involved a motorcycle. Another involved an emergency vehicle. Meanwhile, some of Musk's decisions - such as widely expanding the availability of the features and stripping the vehicles of radar sensors - appear to have contributed to the reported uptick in incidents, according to experts who spoke with The Post.
 
Tesla and Elon Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
 
NHTSA said a report of a crash involving driver-assistance does not itself imply that the technology was the cause. 'NHTSA has an active investigation into Tesla Autopilot, including Full-Self Driving,' spokeswoman Veronica Morales said, noting the agency doesn't comment on open investigations. 'NHTSA reminds the public that all advanced driver assistance systems require the human driver to be in control and fully engaged in the driving task at all times. Accordingly, all state laws hold the human driver responsible for the operation of their vehicles.'
 
Musk has repeatedly defended his decision to push driver-assistance technologies to Tesla owners, arguing that the benefit outweighs the harm.
 
'At the point of which you believe that adding autonomy reduces injury and death, I think you have a moral obligation to deploy it even though you're going to get sued and blamed by a lot of people,' Musk said last year. 'Because the people whose lives you saved don't know that their lives were saved. And the people who do occasionally die or get injured, they definitely know - or their state does.'
 
Former NHTSA senior safety adviser Missy Cummings, a professor at George Mason University's College of Engineering and Computing, said the surge in Tesla crashes is troubling.
 
'Tesla is having more severe - and fatal - crashes than people in a normal data set,' she said in response to the figures analyzed by The Post. One likely cause, she said, is the expanded rollout over the past year and a half of Full Self-Driving, which brings driver-assistance to city and residential streets. 'The fact that . . . anybody and everybody can have it. . . . Is it reasonable to expect that might be leading to increased accident rates? Sure, absolutely.'
 
Cummings said the number of fatalities compared to overall crashes was also a concern.
 
It is unclear whether the data captures every crash involving Tesla's driver-assistance systems. NHTSA's data includes some incidents where it is 'unknown' whether Autopilot or Full Self-Driving was in use. Those include three fatalities, including one last year.
 
NHTSA, the nation's top auto safety regulator, began collecting the data after a federal order in 2021 required automakers to disclose crashes involving driver-assistance technology. The total number of crashes involving the technology is minuscule compared with all road incidents; NHTSA estimates that more than 40,000 people died in wrecks of all kinds last year.
 
Since the reporting requirements were introduced, the vast majority of the 807 automation-related crashes have involved Tesla, the data show. Tesla - which has experimented more aggressively with automation than other automakers - also is linked to almost all of the deaths.
 
Subaru ranks second with 23 reported crashes since 2019. The enormous gulf probably reflects wider deployment and use of automation across Tesla's fleet of vehicles, as well as the wider range of circumstances in which Tesla drivers are encouraged to use Autopilot.
 
Autopilot, which Tesla introduced in 2014, is a suite of features that enable the car to maneuver itself from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, maintaining speed and distance behind other vehicles and following lane lines. Tesla offers it as a standard feature on its vehicles, of which more than 800,000 are equipped with Autopilot on  roads, though advanced iterations come at a cost.
 
Full Self-Driving, an experimental feature that customers must purchase, allows Teslas to maneuver from point A to B by following turn-by-turn directions along a route, halting for stop signs and traffic lights, making turns and lane changes, and responding to hazards along the way. With either system, Tesla says drivers must monitor the road and intervene when necessary.
 
The uptick in crashes coincides with Tesla's aggressive rollout of Full Self-Driving, which has expanded from around 12,000 users to nearly 400,000 in a little more than a year. Nearly two-thirds of all driver-assistance crashes that Tesla has reported to NHTSA occurred in the past year.
 
Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has conducted research on autonomous vehicle safety for 25 years, said the prevalence of Teslas in the data raises crucial questions.
 
'A significantly higher number certainly is a cause for concern,' he said. 'We need to understand if it's due to actually worse crashes or if there's some other factor such as a dramatically larger number of miles being driven with Autopilot on.'
 
In February, Tesla issued a recall of more than 360,000 vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving over concerns that the software prompted its vehicles to disobey traffic lights, stop signs and speed limits.
 
The flouting of traffic laws, documents posted by the safety agency said, 'could increase the risk of a collision if the driver does not intervene.' Tesla said it remedied the issues with an over-the-air software update, remotely addressing the risk.
 
While Tesla constantly tweaked its driver-assistance software, it also took the unprecedented step of eliminating its radar sensors from new cars and disabling them from vehicles already on the road - depriving them of a critical sensor as Musk pushed a simpler hardware set amid the global computer chip shortage. Musk said last year, 'Only very high resolution radar is relevant.'
 
It has recently taken steps to reintroduce radar sensors, according to government filings first reported by Electrek.
 
In a March presentation, Tesla claimed Full Self-Driving crashes at a rate at least five times lower than vehicles in normal driving, in a comparison of miles driven per collision. That claim, and Musk's characterization of Autopilot as 'unequivocally safer,' is impossible to test without access to the detailed data that Tesla possesses.
 
Autopilot, largely a highway system, operates in a less complex environment than the range of situations experienced by a typical road user.
 
It is unclear which of the systems was in use in the fatal crashes: Tesla has asked NHTSA not to disclose that information. In the section of the NHTSA data specifying the software version, Tesla's incidents read - in all capital letters - 'redacted, may contain confidential business information.'
 
Both Autopilot and Full Self-Driving have come under scrutiny in recent years. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told the Associated Press last month that Autopilot is not an appropriate name 'when the fine print says you need to have your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road at all times.'
 
NHTSA has opened multiple probes into Tesla's crashes and other problems with its driver-assistance software. One has focused on 'phantom braking,' a phenomenon in which vehicles abruptly slow down for imagined hazards.
 
In one case last year, detailed by The Intercept, a Tesla Model S allegedly using driver-assistance suddenly braked in traffic on the San Francisco Bay Bridge, resulting in an eight-vehicle pileup that left nine people injured, including a 2-year-old.
 
In other complaints filed with NHTSA, owners say the cars slammed on the brakes when encountering semi-trucks in oncoming lanes.
 
Many crashes involve similar settings and conditions. NHTSA has received more than a dozen reports of Teslas slamming into parked emergency vehicles while in Autopilot, for example. Last year, NHTSA upgraded its investigation of those incidents to an 'engineering analysis.'
 
Also last year, NHTSA opened two consecutive special investigations into fatal crashes involving Tesla vehicles and motorcyclists. One occurred in Utah, when a motorcyclist on a Harley-Davidson was traveling in a high-occupancy lane on Interstate 15 outside Salt Lake City, shortly after 1 a.m., according to authorities. A Tesla in Autopilot struck the bike from behind.
 
'The driver of the Tesla did not see the motorcyclist and collided with the back of the motorcycle, which threw the rider from the bike,' the Utah Department of Public Safety said. The motorcyclist died at the scene, Utah authorities said.
 
'It's very dangerous for motorcycles to be around Teslas,' Cummings said.
 
Of hundreds of Tesla driver-assistance crashes, NHTSA has focused on about 40 Tesla incidents for further analysis, hoping to gain deeper insight into how the technology operates. Among them was the North Carolina crash involving Mitchell, the student disembarking from the school bus.
 
Afterward, Mitchell awoke in the hospital with no recollection of what happened. He still doesn't grasp the seriousness of it, his aunt said. His memory problems are hampering him as he tries to catch up in school. Local outlet WRAL reported that the impact of the crash shattered the Tesla's windshield.
 
The Tesla driver, Howard G. Yee, was charged with multiple offenses in the crash, including reckless driving, passing a stopped school bus and striking a person, a class I felony, according to North Carolina State Highway Patrol Sgt. Marcus Bethea.
 
Authorities said Yee had fixed weights to the steering wheel to trick Autopilot into registering the presence of a driver's hands: Autopilot disables the functions if steering pressure is not applied after an extended amount of time. Yee directed a reporter to his attorney, who did not respond to The Post's request for comment.
 
NHTSA is still investigating the crash, and an agency spokeswoman declined to offer further details, citing the ongoing investigation. Tesla asked the agency to exclude the company's summary of the incident from public view, saying it 'may contain confidential business information.'
 
Lynch said her family has kept Yee in their thoughts, and regards his actions as a mistake prompted by excessive trust in the technology, what experts call 'automation complacency.'
 
'We don't want his life to be ruined over this stupid accident,' she said.
 
But when asked about Musk, Lynch had sharper words.
 
'I think they need to ban automated driving,' she said. 'I think it should be banned.'",stripes.com,3181,news,US,en,,https://www.stripes.com/incoming/wtssbk-tesla-autopilot-1stld-writethru_006c7402-078a-11ee-9f09-eb8af716c033.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/tesla-autopilot-1stld-writethru_006c7402-078a-11ee-9f09-eb8af716c033.jpg,False,@starsandstripes,7.5909686,f980fa99e25770b95b2a8582537e4fbc

The Edmonton Police Service says officers were called to a serious collision in the city's southeast in the area of Ellerslie Road and 17 Street at around 1 a.m.

They say a 2023 Tesla with six adults was reportedly speeding east on Ellerslie when it lost control and rolled several times.

Two men and one woman were pronounced dead at the scene.

Paramedics treated and transported two additional men to hospital in critical condition, as well as a woman whose condition was described as serious but stable.

Investigators believe speed to be a significant factor in the collision, and they're asking anyone who has information or dash cam video of the incident to contact them.

Speed is t...,"The electric car market is speeding up as consumer interest in EVs grows and a steady stream of new models arrive to fill different niches. Speed is the operative word when it comes to describing the 2023 Kia EV6 GT and Tesla Model Y Performance. These vehicles blend the acceleration and agility of a sports car with the packaging of an electric SUV. They also maintain a practical side thanks to their roomy second rows and a long roster of tech features. The automotive experts at Edmunds put these performance-themed EVs to the test to determine which is the better buy.

PERFORMANCE

The Tesla Model Y Performance name provides an obvious hint that speed won't be in short supply. The Performance trim sits above the base and Long Range versions of Tesla's most popular model.

Tesla doesn't provide official horsepower ratings for the Model Y but the output is certainly prodigious. At Edmunds' test track, the all-wheel-drive Model Y Performance needed only 3.7 seconds to zing its way from zero to 60 mph. That's fast for a purebred sports car, much less a small SUV with an optional third row of seats. Keep your foot in it and the Model Y will clear the quarter mile in 11.8 seconds.

Sitting atop the EV6 lineup, the all-wheel-drive GT boasts 576 horsepower, making it the fastest and most powerful production vehicle ever produced by the South Korean automaker. The EV6 GT was marginally quicker than the Tesla — 0-60 mph in 3.6 seconds and the quarter mile in 11.7 seconds — but these two SUVs equally satisfy your need for speed.

Winner: tie

COMFORT

Important differences emerge when the road turns bumpy. The Model Y's handling is responsive and accurate, but over imperfect pavement, the Tesla's firm ride becomes rough and jittery. On a long trip, it can get tiring. In contrast, the EV6 GT rides much more smoothly. In addition, the EV6 GT's front seats are more comfortable and supportive than the Model Y's.

Winner: EV6

RANGE

Dynamically it's close, but that's not the case with driving range. The Model Y Performance can go an EPA-estimated 303 miles on a single charge. In the EV6 GT, you have a measly 206 miles. Edmunds also performed its own independent range tests and found the difference isn't quite as stark in real-world driving, but the Model Y still has the edge. Access to Tesla's extensive network of Supercharger charging stations further makes the Model Y a more viable option for long-distance drives.

Winner: Model Y

INTERIOR DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY

The cabin of the Tesla Model Y can be considered wildly futuristic or annoyingly austere, depending on your perspective. Nearly all vehicle functions are handled via the 15-inch touchscreen positioned in the center of the dashboard. The icons are large and feature sharp graphics, but the overreliance on touch controls can be distracting. Additionally, the system is not compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone connectivity.

Kia opted for a less cutting-edge interior, but it has a more user-friendly layout and an intuitive 12.3-inch touchscreen with standard smartphone connectivity. It's not avant-garde like the Model Y, but based on our testing, it's the more appealing of the two interiors. The same goes for advanced driver aids. Tesla offers more distinctive features, such as vehicle summoning and hands-free driving, but we prefer the everyday functionality of the EV6 GT's aids.

Winner: EV6 GT

PRICING AND VALUE

Both SUVs come loaded with nearly every available comfort feature available. However, the Model Y offers nearly 10 cubic feet more of cargo space behind the rear seats, giving it more utility than the EV6 GT. Due to significant price reductions earlier this year, the Tesla Model Y Performance has a current starting price of $55,880, including destination. The base price of the Kia EV6 GT is significantly more: $62,925. Additionally, the Model Y qualifies for a $7,500 federal tax credit. The EV6 GT does not, though Kia is currently trying to compensate by offering $7,500 off EV6 leasing for well-qualified lessees. Kia does offer a longer warranty but the Model Y Performance's significantly lower price can't be ignored.

Winner: Model Y

EDMUNDS SAYS: The Kia EV6 GT is extremely quick and is more comfortable and refined than the Tesla. Subjectively, it's a more enjoyable EV to drive. But for most shoppers, the Model Y's longer range and less expensive price make it the better value buy overall.

Tesla owners probably won't be very happy that the EV maker is opening up its Supercharger network to outsiders. 
 
In May, 
Ford and Tesla announced a partnership
 allowing the Detroit automaker to use Tesla 
chargers
 starting in 2024. And last week, it was also announced that 
GM would gain access next year. 
 
While the partnership among rivals benefits 
Tesla from a revenue standpoint
, it may cause some tension with its car owners. 
 
""So nothing is going to irritate a Tesla owner more than lining up behind a bunch of vehicles from 
Ford
 and 
General Motors
,"" said Craig Irwin, a senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners, on 
Yahoo Finance Friday
. 
 
""I mean, imagine a big 
Hummer
. It's going to take a charger for an hour in front of you while you've got to go and do your errands and get your groceries. It's not going to be something where people are going to say, 'Oh great, that car has General Motors badge on it. But the charger says Tesla. I paid for that. What's up with that?'""
 
Irwin isn't the only one who is worried about how these charging deals may affect its relationship with Tesla's customers. 
 
Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, 
said on CNBC Friday
 that it's possible Tesla owners will be frustrated by the change, as it could lead to longer wait times. 
 
Tesla's Supercharger network is comprised of some 7,000 locations in North America, 
according to the Department of Energy
. It has long been considered one of the company's most notable advantages over the competition. This is because range anxiety is a top concern among consumers shopping for an EV. Tesla knew this, so it started building out its network about a decade ago to address the issue. 
 
Earlier this year after Tesla first said it intended
 to open up to the public
, some owners 
told Insider they were upset by the move
 because exclusive access to the Supercharging network was part of the reason they bought a Tesla. But some said that it was a good move that would help accelerate EV adoption, while also putting pressure on other rival charging companies to improve their service. 
 
But allowing other car owners to use the network may also eventually benefit Tesla owners, too. 
 
Tesla could use the revenue 
generated
 by new customers to invest in expanding its charging network, meaning more access for everyone, said Cathie Wood, Ark Invest CEO, during a 
CNBC interview on Friday.
 
""What's interesting about this is it does help Tesla underwrite the charging station expense,"" Wood, who has a $2,000 price target on Tesla stock by 2027, said. ""Because if you look at Tesla sales they are highly concentrated on the coasts. Now, it's going to make a lot more sense for Tesla to 
roll
 out charging stations that much faster throughout the country.""

Investors shouldn't be surprised if Tesla were to soon launch its own full-scale financing arm as part of the company's efforts to pull more customers and grab more share of the 
electric vehicle
 market, Morgan Stanley said.
 
""For years Tesla could 
sell a car
 for cash or minimal 
leasing
. But as Tesla looks to 'acquire' the next 5 to 10mn, customers require new solutions in a market where 90% are bought on monthly payment,"" the bank's analysts said in a note this week. ""We think the time for full-line Tesla Finco has arrived.""
 
Many auto makers already have a so-called captive financing unit – or a subsidiary financial company that offers loans for retail sales – with firms like 
Toyota
, 
Honda
, and 
Ford
 using their respective financing arms to offer financing for prospective buyers.
 
That's something Tesla needs to incorporate into its business, especially if it plans on capturing more of the EV market, the analysts said. Financing is now the ""norm"" in the auto industry. Though most of Tesla's early sales were done in cash, it's matured as a company and now has the cash flow to support a finco, the note added. 
 
Tesla has been waging a pricing war with its rivals, having 
slashed prices on key models repeatedly
 in the past year to stay competitive. While that's propped up demand, the cuts have 
eaten into Tesla's profit margins
, causing its stock to slip after its first-quarter earnings call. 
 
Other commentators remain bullish on the flagship EV-stock, particularly as 
Tesla strikes deals with other auto makers to open up its charging network
. Tesla shares traded at $254.50 on Wednesday, up 136% from the start of the year.

China will play an indispensable role in Tesla accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy, Grace Tao, vice-president of Tesla, said in an interview on Wednesday.
 
The vision, Tao said, goes beyond a mere slogan — it resonates within the minds of every Tesla employee. The company is devoted to making this vision a reality by measures including manufacturing zero-emission electric vehicles and working toward replacing conventional power grids with sustainable energy sources.
 
Tesla's commitment to sustainability closely aligns with China's dual carbon goals, forming an ideal partnership, Tao said. With a shared commitment to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions, Tesla has reaffirmed its resolute investment in the Chinese market, she added.
 
Having entered the Chinese market a decade ago, the United States-based company has made significant strides in expanding its footprint in China. The crowning achievement among these endeavors is the establishment of the Shanghai Gigafactory, serving as Tesla's inaugural manufacturing facility outside the US.
 
The Shanghai Gigafactory demonstrates high energy efficiency and production effectiveness, Tao said, with a Tesla vehicle rolling off the production line in less than 40 seconds.
 
In 2022, the Shanghai plant delivered more than 710,000 vehicles, accounting for more than half of Tesla's global deliveries.
 
The factory also serves as an export hub, using China's supply chain and manufacturing capabilities to produce high-quality intelligent EVs, such as the Model 3 and Model Y. These vehicles are sold in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere.
 
In April, Tesla announced another big investment in Shanghai — the construction of a new megafactory dedicated to manufacturing the company's energy-storage product, Megapack.
 
The factory will initially produce 10,000 Megapack units every year, equal to approximately 40 gigawatt-hours of energy storage. Its products are expected to be sold worldwide.
 
Furthermore, Tesla opened its first overseas research and development center in Shanghai in 2021, dedicated to vehicle development. The Shanghai Gigafactory Data Center was established that same year to securely store data generated by Tesla's operations in China and customer information.
 
Tesla has also demonstrated its involvement in major exhibitions in China, including the China International Fair for Trade in Services. Since 2016, Tesla has been a participant in this event, showcasing its cutting-edge products and technologies.
 
At this year's fair, to be held on Sept 2-6, Tesla plans to showcase advancements including EV models, energy storage facilities and others, Tao said.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202306/19/648f9862a31033ad342b3e09.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,8.326236,df771aacdc6c5c2b4797e36f37d7d600

The Tesla Supercharger network could remove the last barrier to EV ownership.
 
Tesla has spent the last several weeks preparing to open access to its previously exclusive Supercharger network, forging partnerships with 
Ford
, 
GM
, and 
Rivian
 since the end of May.
 
Long-standing barriers to EV ownership like 
battery
 range and price are finally being addressed, leaving one last obstacle for many would-be EV-owners: access to public fast-charging stations. 
 
""Infrastructure is at least 50% of the battle for making the switch,"" Karl Brauer, automotive analyst for iSeeCars, told Insider. ""We've got to get people confident that the cars will work for them when they need them.""
 
As more 
electric cars
 have hit the road in the last several years, terms like ""range anxiety"" have crept into the lexicon, defining the experience of driving a plug-in car more than the zippy instant torque or quiet ride.
 
Tesla has the largest fast-charging network in North America, with about 
20,000 Superchargers
 that previously only connected to Tesla vehicles. Non-Tesla EV owners have long relied on an inconsistent patchwork of public 
chargers
, which can be difficult to find and are often not well-maintained. 
 
Providing more drivers with access to Tesla's vast and reliable Supercharger network may be enough to sway some EV-curious shoppers, according to Brauer.
 
""Some people might find that the number of chargers they have access to in their area goes from 6 to 25,"" he said. ""That person could have their mind changed quickly.""
 
Superchargers are not a magic solution
 
Still, Brauer said, access to a Supercharger network alone will not solve the industry's charging infrastructure problem – nor will it cure range anxiety.
 
A recent study of EV infrastructure
 done by iSeeCars found that of the 150,000 EV chargers in the U.S., only about 30,000 are fast chargers (including the Tesla Supercharger network). Only about 11,000 of those fast chargers are non-Tesla chargers so opening up the Supercharger network does make a difference – but doesn't solve the problem.
 
More access to Superchargers could also create a new problem: long lines.
 
Tesla drivers covet their exclusive access to the Supercharger network, and drivers from other brands flooding to their stations 
could create some friction,
 Brauer said.
 
Giving up an advantage
 
Allowing other car companies to use the Supercharger network 
takes away Tesla's last advantage over its competitors
, who in the last several years have 
caught up to Tesla on range and driver-assist technologies
.
 
Tesla recognizes its Supercharger advantage. In addition to price cuts this year, Tesla has dangled free Supercharger miles to lure in more customers.
 
Still, the deals with 
Ford
, 
GM
, and Rivian also create a steady stream of revenue for Tesla at a time when the company is rapidly ramping up production against the headwinds of a slowing car market.
 
Wall Street has reacted well, reversing a nearly two-week slide in the stock price late last week.
 
""We believe 'what has changed' for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM Supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.

""It hasn't necessarily been tested and certified for other auto manufacturers, so we want to make sure it's going to work but we are planning to require NACS at our state funded and federally funded sites in the future.""

Buell said the decision is about 'future proofing' the state's investments.
Buell said state officials are still trying to determine the right mix of NACS chargers based on current federal requirements.

The plan by Washington may add pressure on other states and the federal government to adopt Tesla's NACS.

— Troy Teslike (@TroyTeslike) June 21, 2023

There have been some concerns about consumer demand for Tesla vehicles in the US lately. That's not because there isn't massive demand for Tesla vehicles. It's just that Tesla production and sales have risen so high that there are questions and concerns about whether they can stay at this level, or even grow from here. Furthermore, a refreshed/new version of the Model 3 is expected to be coming out soon, which logically slows down sales of the current version of the Model 3.

Concerns have been raised recently due to Tesla cutting prices and offering buyer incentives, like free Supercharging for a few months. Also, inventory levels have been fairly high … until the last few days.

Graph courtesy of Tesla Inventory Tracker.

This website tracks Tesla inventory data, as listed by Tesla on its own site, and then also graphs it by model. What you can see (screenshot above) is that Model X inventory spiked in early April, and inventory of all of the models climbed a bit for different periods of time. But in the past couple of days, inventory of all 4 models has dropped like a rock.

Another way to visualize the data is as a stacked bar chart. That looks perhaps even more dramatic. See here:

Chart courtesy of Tesla Inventory Tracker.

And, a third and final graphic is the line graph below showing total Tesla inventory in the US for the same time period.

That last one does help to show that inventory right now is very similar to what it was at the end of February and beginning of March.

The big question is: what has caused Tesla inventory to drop so much in the last day or two? Perhaps it is that recently produced Tesla vehicles are being shipped elsewhere now, draining inventory. Though, that doesn't seem super likely since Tesla has historically focused on nearby, US shipments with vehicles produced at the end of quarters.

Perhaps the 3 months of free Supercharging is getting more vehicles out the door. That seems unlikely, though, since the monetary value of that is quite low.

Perhaps the change in US policy giving the base Model 3 the full $7,500 tax credit (instead of half of that, $3,750) is showing up in these numbers. That change was made a couple of weeks ago. This is around the time that might start kicking in when looking at inventory numbers. Maybe.

Tesla also started offering discounts (up to $2,410 off, as Chris Boylan found) a couple of weeks ago. That may be the biggest factor of all. Who isn't a bit inspired to buy when a car they want drops in price by a couple thousand dollars, or by more than $5,000 if you can take advantage of the full US EV tax credit and take that into account? Heck, I'm not even in the market for a Model 3 (I have one) and that looks tempting.

But how do last last two matters explain inventory of the other models dropping? Well, there have also been price cuts of other models (even if not as much in the case of the Model Y), and if you look again at that first line graph, the bulk of the drop has come from Model 3 inventory dropping.

, and that the authorities here are ready to support the company and its ventures and provide the necessary facilities.
Tesla said earlier this week that it is looking to make a significant investment in India.

After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US, Tesla chief Elon Musk said he saw India as holding more promise than any other large country around the globe. He said he plans to pay a visit to the country in 2024.

 and 
Elon Musk
 got into a bit of a spat between billionaires on Monday via Twitter. The owner of the 
Dallas Mavericks
 then proved why he is one of the greatest minds in business.
Joe Rogan
 was responsible for starting the beef that resulted in a genius promo for Cuban's pharmaceutical company. The incident started over vaccines and quickly turned into something else.
Elon Musk savagely booed on stage by thousands of people at Dave Chapelle gig
Rogan, 55, challenged vaccines expert 
Peter Hotez
 to debate anti-vaxxer and presidential candidate
 Robert F. Kennedy Jr
. on The Joe Rogan Experience in exchange for 
$100,000 to the charity of his choice
.
Hotez, 65, has already appeared on Rogan's podcast several times in the past and is willing to do so again, but not to debate RFK, which he says would be like an episode of 
Jerry Springer
.
Musk, 51, then entered the conversation and poked fun at Hotez for not wanting to debate Kennedy, but then softened the blow by saying he is vaccinated.
Mark Cuban is always closing
Cuban, 64, came to the defense of Hotez by calling Rogan a bully and saying he and Musk are just as bad as mainstream media. The tweet also served as a promo for his new company that sells medication at much lower prices.
""Way to talk in generalities, Joe. Not saying there aren't a lot of fucked up things about pharma. That's why we created 
Costplusdrugs.com
,"" Cuban tweeted. ""But to ignore that the same industry has saved who knows how many lives is bullshit and you know it. It's also disrespectful to all the doctors, researchers and medical professionals that dedicate their lives to saving lives, like Dr. Hotez and the 800k plus doctors in the country that believe vaccines save lives.
""You aren't trying to find the ground truth on vaccines. If you were, you would bring on someone who focused on debating the issue, like '
The Real Truther
.' Trying to bully Dr. Hotez is ridiculous. You have producers that will prepare you and you get to control the conversation. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also has a staff ready to prepare him and these topics are what he talks about in every speech. You both do this on a daily basis. Dr. Hotez works every day to try to find ways to help people.
""Joe, you and Elon Musk's Twitter are the mainstream online media and your platforms have become everything supposedly wrong with mainstream media. You are driven by self interest. Just like the MSM always has been accused of. And you both have earned that right. You busted your asses to be great at what you do and earned all you have accomplished. But don't lie to yourselves and all of us and tell us you are different. You aren't.""
Elon Musk buys what Mark Cuban is selling
Musk seemingly took offense to the tweet and when one Twitter user asked Cuban why his company doesn't offer the drug 
Ivermectin
, he wrote, ""good question.
Cuban explained the reason and was evidently more than enough for Musk to buy into the marketing scheme.
""I'm sorry, I didn't see you enter the discussion, Elon Musk,"" Cuban tweeted. ""The price we were able to get was much higher than other available sources. We are trying to get a better price. We do sell HCQ. Our mission is to be the low cost provider of every med we are allowed to sell. You should have your employees use us. It will save them and Twitter a f--- ton of money.""
Cuban is clearly 
always closing
 and did so once again. Musk told him he would have 
Tesla 
and 
Space X
 inquire further. What a sell.","(c)  2023, Unidad Editorial, S.A.",2023,sport,ES,en,,https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/443cc79f7bab8bddd950ee9b10b5ce38/resize/1200/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/06/21/16873036279025.jpg,False,@MarcainEnglish,7.077277,ddb6148c2310463969dfcfbe13038aec

Electric vehicle maker Rivian says it will follow General Motors and Ford and join Tesla's charging network next year. The startup truck, SUV and delivery van maker said Tuesday that it will include ports with Tesla's connector on future Rivian vehicles starting in 2025. Associated Press/Feb. 8, 2023

DETROIT -- Electric vehicle maker Rivian says it will follow General Motors and Ford and join Tesla's charging network next year.

The startup truck, SUV and delivery van maker says Tuesday that like GM and Ford, it will include ports with Tesla's connector on future Rivian vehicles starting in 2025. It also will offer an adapter for owners of current Rivian EVs.

It is another domino to fall as the auto industry considers switching to Tesla's connector, which it calls the North American Charging Standard. At present, nearly all automakers other than Tesla use what is called a CCS connector developed with the Society of Automotive Engineers.

Tesla has more direct current fast-charging plugs in the U.S. than any other network, and its stations are in prime locations along freeway travel corridors.

Other automakers also are looking into the switch. On Monday, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said his company's U.S. teams are studying the change and will make a decision in a few weeks.

""We right now are evaluating that possibility,"" Tavares said in a brief interview with The Associated Press. ""It can have good things and bad things.""

He said the good things are being evaluated, and the bad things include dependence on Tesla.

Currently Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, has no fully electric vehicles on sale in the U.S., but it does sell three plug-in gas-electric hybrids that can go short distances on battery power. The company plans to sell an electric commercial van this year, followed by an electric Ram pickup and other vehicles.

Rivian is a relatively small player in the U.S. automotive market, selling just under 30,000 vehicles from 2021 through the first quarter of this year. But the Irvine, California, company is viewed as a key Tesla competitor.

Like GM and Ford, Rivian owners will get access to more than 12,000 Tesla Supercharger plugs. In the U.S., Tesla has 1,797 Supercharger stations and more than 19,000 plugs, according to the Department of Energy.

Since the stations are direct current fast-chargers, they can charge EVs relatively quickly as people travel.

ChargePoint has the biggest charging network in the U.S. with more than 32,000 stations and 55,000 plugs, but most of them are Level 2 chargers that can take up to eight hours to get a battery up to a full charge.

The Energy Department says there are about 54,000 public charging stations nationwide with more than 136,000 plugs. While most are slower Level 2 chargers, the network of DC fast chargers is growing.

Still, industry analysts say there is growing momentum to switch to Tesla's connector to become the standard in the U.S., although vehicles likely will need to be able to use both connectors for a while.

GM and Ford say they're not paying Tesla anything for access to the network, but owners will pay Tesla to charge just like any other charging system.

Rivian said in a statement that in addition to joining Tesla's network, it will continue to expand its own charging system, where it will incorporate Tesla's connector.

Shares of Rivian and Tesla both rose about 4% in midday Tuesday afternoon trading. Tesla stock is up about 40% since Ford first announced it would join the charging network on May 25.

The Tesla valve is a non-moving check valve used in various industries to control fluid flow. It is a passive flow control device that does not require external power to operate. Due to its unique geometry, it causes more pressure drop in the reverse direction than in the forward direction. This device's optimal performance in heat transfer applications has led to the use of Tesla valve designs in heat sinks and heat exchangers. This study investigated a Tesla valve with unconventional geometry through numerical analysis. Two geometrical parameters and inlet velocity were selected as input variables. Also, the pressure drop ratio (PDR) and temperature difference ratio (TDR) parameters were chosen as the investigated responses. By leveraging numerical data, artificial neural networks were trained to construct precise prediction models for responses. The optimal designs of the Tesla valve for different conditions were then reported using the genetic algorithm method and prediction models. The results indicated that the coefficient of determination for both prediction models was above 0.99, demonstrating high accuracy. The most optimal PDR value was 4.581, indicating that the pressure drop in the reverse flow direction is 358.1% higher than in the forward flow direction. The best TDR response value was found to be 1.862.

Index gains have been largely driven by the 'surging seven' – Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet. 
Stocktake has covered this theme repeatedly of late, but breadth finally appears to be improving. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which weighs each component stock equally, has been strong lately, suggesting more stocks are participating in the rally. 
The percentage of stocks above their 50-day (62 per cent) and 200-day average (60 per cent) is rising. Hi Mount Research's Willie Delwiche, who has been concerned by weak breadth this year, is encouraged by the fact the number of stocks hitting new highs is now exceeding the number of new lows. Markets have been more 'balanced' in June, says Bespoke Investment. 
At the end of May, just three of the S&P 500′s 11 sectors had outperformed the index. However, every sector is up in June, with the number of outperformers 'much more evenly split'. 
Market breadth still isn't great but buying is no longer confined to technology stocks, says Barclays, which may be 'a prelude to a sustained breakout from the recent trading range'.",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,Proinsias O'Mahony,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/WWiSC2Pl_WqHRYeEqbsCYc70HEo=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/5WJLWWDLZBCO5PNZQTDITQNFDI.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,6.4563093,dc1d00580226d348de5f8d4a69f45a01

Ford CEO Jim Farley dismissed concerns that Tesla's Cybertruck could pose a threat to the automaker's F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck 
during an interview
 with CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday.
 
""The reality is, America loves an underdog — and we are the market leader for EV 
trucks
 and vans, and we know those customers better than anyone,"" Farley said. '""And if he wants to design a Cybertruck for Silicon Valley people, fine.""
 
The Cybertruck will be Tesla's first 
electric pickup truck
. Up until recently, Ford has been one of few automakers to produce an EV 
pickup truck
. Last year, Ford said it 
delivered
 over 13,000 electric 
F-150
 trucks as the company worked to ramp up production and fulfill about 
200,000 reservations.
 Tesla has the majority of 
the overall EV market
 in the US, but the market for pickup trucks is 
one of the most lucrative in the country
.
 
Farley went on to describe Tesla's pickup truck as ""like a cool high-end product parked in front of a hotel.""
 
""I don't make trucks like that,"" Farley said. ""I make trucks for real people who do real work, and that's a different kind of truck.""
 
A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Insider.
 
Tesla has yet to provide official pricing for the futuristic truck, but 
Kelley Blue Book
 places the starting price at around $50,000 — about $10,000 shy of the 
price
 for the 2023 
F-150 Lightning.
 
Tesla CEO 
Elon Musk
 has said the carmaker plans to release its Cybertruck later this year and 
confirmed
 during Tesla's quarterly earnings call in April that he expects to commence deliveries by the end of the year. The billionaire has changed the delivery date — which is 
two years later
 than he initially predicted — several times since he 
first announced
 the truck in 2019.
 
It's unclear whether the Cybertruck will have the same functionality as a 
Ford pickup
. In May, a 
leaked Tesla report
 showed that the vehicle had some design flaws, including issues with suspension, handling, and 
braking
, Wired reported. In 2019, 
MotorTrend reported
 that the Cybertruck wouldn't market well to working professionals like contractors and plumbers due to its design.
 
Insider's Nora Naughton previously reported
 that the Cybertruck could be ""the 
Hummer
 of the 2020s"" and redefine what a pickup truck can look like. Last year, the EV blog Electrek 
reported
 Tesla had over 1.5 million pre-orders for the Cybertruck. The pre-orders only require a $100 deposit.
 
Farley's interview comes only a few weeks after Ford 
announced
 that it plans to adopt Tesla's charging standard and begin using a portion of the company's Supercharging network — one of 
Tesla's key advantages
 in the EV race.
 
The Ford CEO told CNBC that he didn't hesitate on the partnership because it's ""good for customers.""

Tesla's chief designer Franz von Holzhausen showed off the automaker's 
highly anticipated Cybertruck
 at Petersen Automotive Museum in California on Sunday.
 
Videos on Twitter from the 
Electrified Cars & Coffee
 event highlighted some of the latest updates to the 
electric pickup truck
, which is expected to hit the market later this year — including the electronic cover on its bed and how to get into the vehicle.
 
One video from the event showed more of 
Tesla's Cybertruck ""vault
,"" also known as the truck's bed. The electric pickup truck has a electrified tonneau cover that slides opened or closed at the touch of a button, covering the 6.5 feet truck bed smoothly.

Another video from an attendee takes an even closer look at the bed of the truck and what appears to be a charge port along the side of the EV.

Von Holzhausen showed how to open the stainless steel doors manually, which can be opened by pushing in on a small button near the edge of the window or on the vehicle's C-pillar. Otherwise, the truck does not have a door handle.
 
Earlier prototypes of the vehicle 
appeared
 to have a door handle along the side of the car that would pop out similar to the 
Model S
 door handles. But, Tesla CEO Elon Musk first announced the vehicle wouldn't have door handles in 2021.
 
""Car recognizes you & opens door,"" he 
said on Twitter.
 
The front window can also 
roll
 all the way down, according to the video of Von Holzhausen driving off the in the vehicle.
 
The design boss 
demonstrated the car's
 rear wheel steering and mobility in a parking garage. In 2021, Musk 
said on Twitter
 that the car will be ""amazing for nimble handling & tight turns!""
 
 —Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) 
June 25, 2023
 
 
Not everything on the vehicle was as sleek as its stainless steel doors. Photos from the event show that the Cybertruck still seems to have a noticeably clunky 
windshield wiper
. 
Insider previously reported
 that previous photos of the Cybertruck showed the massive windshield wiper leaves much to be desired.
 
In the past, Musk has said there's ""no easy solution"" to the vehicle's massive windshield and the 
initial 2019 design
 for the Cybertruck didn't even include windshield wipers.
 
The Tesla CEO has said the carmaker plans to release its Cybertruck later this year and

Electric car giant Tesla is set to realise fully autonomous vehicles ""later this year"", CEO Elon Musk said Thursday, in the billionaire's latest forecast for the long-anticipated milestone.

""In terms of where Tesla is at this stage, I think we are very close to achieving full self-driving without human supervision,"" Musk said via video link at the opening ceremony of an artificial intelligence conference in Shanghai.

""This is only speculation, but I think we'll achieve full self-driving, maybe what you would call four or five, I think later this year,"" the billionaire added, referring to two of the most advanced levels of autonomous driving technology.

The mercurial entrepreneur and Twitter owner admitted that he had been wrong in previous predictions on this timeline, but added: ""I feel like we're closer to it than we ever have been.""

Musk has missed his own deadlines for a fully autonomous vehicle -- and Tesla's driver-assistance technology has provoked regulatory probes in the United States.

China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market and Tesla announced in April it would build a second massive factory in Shanghai.

His appearance at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai marks his latest effort to maintain close links to China, following a visit to the country in May.

Electric vehicles make up a quarter of car sales in China, the world's largest car market, and dozens of new models from domestic and Western brands were unveiled in April at the country's first auto show since Covid restrictions were lifted.

BCG added additional context on several companies in its report, including Germany's 
Bosch (37th)
. According to BCG, the engineering and technology company has a global R&D organization of 84,800 employees across 130 locations. Bosch has also maintained R&D spending (as a share of sales) at between 7.6% and 8.2% from 2018 through 2021.
Another highlight was 
Samsung (7th)
, which spent over $17 billion (9% of annual sales) on R&D in 2021, making the South Korean conglomerate one of the world's largest spenders on innovation. Samsung was also granted 6,300 U.S. patents in 2022, the most out of any company.
As this ranking shows, innovative companies aren't just tech companies. 
McDonald's (34th)
 is considered by BCG as the 'restaurant industry frontrunner in technology innovation and investment'.
For example, McDonald's recently acquired 
Apprente
, a startup that develops voice-based technologies, and 
Dynamic Yield
, a firm specializing in creating customizable online experiences. McDonald's aims to leverage these technologies to improve ordering times and offer customers better choices.
Companies by Nationality
Now let's examine the ranking through a different lens—nationality. The following chart compares the country breakdowns of the 2013 and 2023 rankings.
The U.S. and China are the only two countries that have increased their share from 2013, pushing out firms from European countries like Germany, the UK, and Italy. We can also see significant declines in Japanese and South Korean representation.
Given China's 
economic growth
, it's likely that Chinese firms will continue to represent more of BCG's ranking in the future. So far, the country's strongest innovator is

Sometimes the stock mar,"Sometimes the stock market can really make you scratch your head. As investors, we're used to being always told to follow a trend, buy into a good thing, don't catch the falling knife. This is why the recent run of downgrades to tesla inc's (nasdaq:tsla) stock is so perplexing.



Key Points



Three downgrades to a Neutral rating in the past two weeks have checked the stock's momentum.



However, shares have already shrugged off the selling and resumed their upward trend.



Even the analysts admit the long-term potential remains intact.

If you're ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now .

For context, shares of the electric vehicle (EV) king have been having their best first half of a year since 2020. They've rallied as much as 170%

from the first week of January, in a move that has seen them reclaim much of the territory they lost last year. But that hasn't stopped analysts from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanely, and Barclays all lowering their rating on the stock in the past week or two.



We here at MarketBeat haven't been shy about our feelings toward Tesla this year. In January, we pointed out how its shares were starting to gain upside momentum; in April, we saw through the poor headlines what was actually a decent report , and earlier this month,

we put a $300 price target

on the stock.

And with shares having had their momentum clipped as a result of these recent downgrades, we're still in the bull camp. That's not to say it will be all plain sailing, however. Let's dive into the recent analyst comments and address them.



First up are those from the guys over at Barclays, who lowered their rating from Equal Weight to Overweight last week on the expectation that Tesla shares need to cool off from their hot first half of the year.

According to analyst Dan Levy and his team, the moment has arrived for investors to lock in their gains from this stage of the rally, one that they feel has become overheated after the recent AI-driven surge and the hype surrounding their Supercharger network.

It's a strange move in that, at the same time, they still went out of their way to name Tesla the long-term winner in the EV world. However, they expect the excitement to build again in late 2024-2025 as its low-cost Model 2 starts to come online.



This was followed by similar comments from the Morgan Stanley team, who made the same Overweight to Equal Weight move. They also flagged the effect the

hype around ai

has had on the stock and saw this as an opportune time to take profits off the table as shares approach fair value. They're also bearish on the company's upcoming earnings report, due next month, where they're looking for EPS of $3.03 versus the wider consensus of $3.33.



This week, Goldman Sachs added their name to the list of cautious Tesla analysts, with the same move and similar comments. Understandably, shares lost some of that momentum which had them up at their highest level since last September, but already the selling has stopped, and heading into the weekend, they're on track to log their fourth up day.



Our take on it? Sure, no one ever went broke taking profits, but investors in Tesla aren't looking for a quick buck, nor are they looking for a low-volatility stock. They have a first-mover advantage, the best economies of scale in the industry, and effectively

no competition even close

to them. Any headwinds that they are facing, for example, higher borrowing costs, are industry-wide, while at the same time, their annual revenue has never been higher.



The stock's rsi is at a healthily bullish 66, far from an overbought reading of over 70, and even while they urged caution, the analysts still gave themselves an out just in case Tesla keeps being Tesla. Morgan Stanley raised its bull case valuation

to $450 from $390 , while Goldman echoed Barclays in remaining bullish on the EV industry and Tesla's leading role in it in the long term. We see Tesla remaining that stock that everyone wants a piece of, and any pullback from here is

an entry opportunity

that investors shouldn't ignore.

454,Tesla Stock Only Worth $20 Based On Gaap Earnings Shortseller,MENAFN,2023-07-03 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106548578/Tesla-Stock-Only-Worth-20-Based-On-Gaap-Earnings-Shortseller,menafn.com,learn the insider secrets of what the top hedge funds are doing today to maximize their upside and gains. Stanphyl Capital's comm,"Stanphyl Capital's commentary for the month ended June 30, 2023, discussing their short position in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Tesla recently announced that it will open its U.S. charging stations to cars from multiple other manufacturers which, in turn, will adopt Tesla's connector and charging protocol. Seeing as many people only buy a Tesla instead of a competing EV in order to access those chargers, and seeing as all the competing charging networks will also adopt this protocol while paying Tesla nothing (Tesla open-sourced it), this will cost Tesla far more in lost auto sale profits than the pennies per share it may gain from charging profits.

Thus any increase in tesla's stock price that can be attributed to this is as ridiculous as the increase attributed to its'AI' that regularly sends Teslas crashing into other vehicles, people, trees and buildings. Speaking of which...

In late-May documents leaked to German publication Handelsblatt revealed that tesla has conducted an egregious, multi-year cover-up of deadly safety problems caused by its (so-called)'Autopilot/Full Self-Driving' system and sudden unintended acceleration, and in June the Washington Post wrote a separate expose about Autopilot & FSD's myriad dangers.

I believe this will finally force regulators to demand a massive, multi-billion-dollar recall and, as importantly, destroy whatever goodwill remains towards this sleazily run company (except, of course, from the diminishing number of hardcore cult members who will deservedly go down with the ship).

Meanwhile, during Q2 Tesla implemented even more worldwide margin-slashing price cuts on top of the massive, margin-destroying cuts it made in Q1. (And those cuts were on top of large cuts made in Q4 2022.)

Yet despite all those cuts, Tesla is only expected to deliver only around 5% more cars in Q2 than it did in Q1, and due to the aforementioned price slashing its earnings will likely again be atrocious-despite booking a massive amount of emission credit revenue, in Q1 they were down 23% vs. Q1 2022 and 32% sequentially and Q1 revenue was also down sequentially.

And as I believe those earnings are artificially high because Tesla deceptively under-amortizes its factories , we should also look at free cash flow, which in Q1 dropped to just $400 million and may soon be wiped out completely.

In other words, Tesla is no longer a'growth' company unless you define'growth' as declining earnings, declining revenue and declining free cash flow!

Most disturbingly for Tesla bulls, despite the massive price cuts vs. Q4 2022, at 1.8 million units the company is only guiding to 11% more delivery volume than Q4's 405,000 annualized run-rate of 1.62 million (and in June cut shifts & workers from its vastly underutilized new German factory).

It's also only guiding to 2% more production than Q4's annualized rate of 1.76 million, so where will the'volume savings' to support price cuts come from? And what will Tesla do for its next'growth trick'? Sell cars at a loss? sell a tiny subcompact beginning in 2025 with an even smaller margin?

Meanwhile the incumbent auto companies can better afford (earnings-wise) to slash prices on their EVs, as those prices can be cross-subsidized by their 95% of volume that comes from highly-profitable ICE vehicles, while Tesla now has nothing that's'highly profitable.'

So while Tesla may'win' an EV price war against other pureplay EV makers, it will lose that war against the incumbent oems . Goodbye'story-stock tech company' and hello'low-margin, cyclical car company' in an industry with single-digit PE ratios, and for Tesla that could mean as little as 8x $2.50/share in 2023 GAAP earnings = a stock price of $20/share vs. June's close of $261.77.

(And please don't lecture me about Tesla's'energy business,' which in Q1 accounted for just 6.5% of revenue and had just an 11% gross margin and likely nets in the low single digits as it's an extremely competitive, low-margin industry.)

Meanwhile, Tesla has objectively lost its'product edge,' with many competing cars now offering comparable or better real-world range , better interiors, similar or faster charging speeds and much better quality. Tesla ranks near the bottom of both consumer reports' reliability survey and the 2023 jd power survey :

In fact, Tesla is likely now the second, third or fourth choice for many EV buyers, and only maintains its volume lead though a short-lived edge in production capacity that will disappear over the next 12 to 36 months as competitors rapidly increase the ability to produce their superior EVs.

Tesla's poorly-built model y faces competition from the much better made (and often just better) electric hyundai ioniq 5 , kia ev6 , ford mustang mach e , cadillac lyriq , nissan ariya , audi q4 e-tron , bmw ix3 , mercedes eqb , chevrolet blazer ev & equinox ev , volvo xc-40 recharge and polestar 3 . And Tesla's Model 3 now has terrific direct'sedan competition' from Volvo's beautiful polestar 2 , bmw's i4 , hyundai's ioniq 6 and volkswagen's id.7 , as well as multiple local competitors in China.

And in the high-end electric car segment worldwide the porsche taycan outsells the Model S, while the spectacular new bmw i7 , mercedes eqs and eqe , audi e-tron gt and lucid air make the Tesla look like a fast Yugo, while the extremely well reviewed new bmw ix , mercedes eqs suv and audi q8 etron (as well as multiple new Chinese models) do the same to the Model X.

And oh, the joke of a'pickup truck' Tesla first previewed in 2019 (and still hasn't shown in production-ready form) won't be much of'growth engine' either, as by the time it's in meaningful mass-production in 2024 it will enter a dogfight of a market vs. Ford's hot-selling all-electric f-150 lightning and GM's fantastic 2023 electric silverado (which already has nearly 200,000 reservations ), while Rivian's pick-up has gotten excellent reviews and Ram will also be out with a great electric truck in 2024.

Indeed, for years I've said'Tesla is Blackberry' – the maker of a first-generation version of a product that – once the market was proven – would be supplanted into niche obscurity by newer, better versions, and now it's finally happening. I believe Musk knows this (hence his recent'Twitter buying distraction'), with VW Group, Hyundai/Kia, Ford, GM, Stellantis, BMW, Mercedes, BYD & other Chinese competitors and, in a few years, Toyota & Honda, stealing Tesla's share and pounding its stock price into the low double-digits, where it will be valued as'just another car company.'

Meanwhile, the NHTSA has initiated the first of what will likely be multiple recalls of Tesla's fraudulently named'Full Self Driving' (even before the aforementioned safety cover-up revealed by Handelsblatt), and in January it was revealed that elon musk personally directed its fake, fraudulent promotional video (something extremely similar to what Theranos did with its blood machines and nikola with its truck ), and that the doj is investigating him for it and so is the sec .

The refund liability potential for Tesla for this is in the billions of dollars, and possibly even the tens of billions if a class action lawsuit proves that the cars involved were purchased solely due to the (fallacious) promise of'full self-driving.'

And, of course, there will be a massive'valuation reappraisal' for Tesla's stock as the world wakes up to the fact that its so-called'autonomy technology' is deadly, trailing-edge garbage that consumer reports now ranks just seventh vs. competitors' systems (behind Ford, GM, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota and Volkswagen) and guidehouse insights now rates dead last :

Meanwhile, the NHTSA continues to report a slew of Autopilot-related deaths (which, as noted earlier, Tesla has been doing its best to hid), yet Tesla has sold this trashy software for over six years now:

...and still promotes it on its website via the aforementioned completely fraudulent video ! (For all Tesla-related deaths cited in the media – which is likely only a small fraction of those that have occurred – please see tesladeaths.com .)

Want to see another Elon Musk/Tesla deception summarized in a simple bar graph ? In this recent Consumer Reports test, note which of these cars never comes close-in any environmental conditions-to meeting its claimed EPA range:

Another favorite Tesla hype story has been built around so-called'proprietary battery technology.' In fact though, Tesla has nothing proprietary there-it doesn't make them, it buys them from panasonic , catl and lg , and it's the biggest liar in the industry regarding the real-world range of its cars. And if new-format 4680 cells enter the market, even if Tesla makes some of its own,

other manufacturers will gladly sell them to anyone , and BMW has already announced it will buy them from CATL and EVE.

The article presents the predictive capabilities of a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation system that operates on the basis of a non-fuzzy neural approach, but also one that is capable of implementing a learning paradigm and working with vague concepts. Within this context, the necessary elements of fuzzy logic are identified and the algebraic formulation of the fuzzy system is presented. It is with the help of the aforementioned that the task of predicting the short-term trend and price of the Tesla share is solved. The functioning of a fuzzy system and fuzzy neural network in the field of time series value prediction is discussed. The authors are inclined to the opinion that, despite the fact that a fuzzy neural network reacts in terms of applicability and effectiveness when solving prediction problems in relation to input data with a faster output than a fuzzy system, and is more 'user friendly', a sufficiently knowledgeable and experienced solver/expert could, by using a fuzzy system, achieve a higher speed of convergence in the learning process than a fuzzy neural network using the minimum range of input data carrying the necessary information. A fuzzy system could therefore be a possible alternative to a fuzzy neural network from the point of view of prediction.

Tesla is looking for test drivers for a three-month stint to capture data and help improve its cars.,"Tesla
 is offering to pay people to drive its EVs this summer.

Tesla is hiring a slew of seasonal employees to drive its cars this summer.
 
The electric-car company said it's looking for people to capture ""high quality data that will contribute to the improvement of our vehicles performance"" for a three-month stint, according to a series of 
job postings
 on its careers website that have gone up over the past two weeks. The position includes day and nighttime shifts.
 
Tesla has 
hired
 for test drivers in the past. Though, the wave of new job listings could indicate the EV company is looking to rely more on internal testing rather than data from Tesla owners, which it has relied on to help test software, including its beta Full Self-Driving program, in realtime.
 
Tesla uses some test drivers to improve is Autopilot driver-assist feature and beta Full Self-Driving software. Test drivers for the company typically drive Teslas that have been outfitted with a series of sensors, John Bernal,  a former test driver for the automaker, previously told Insider. The drivers often repeatedly enact scenarios that could confuse Tesla's Full Self-Driving software, like left-hand turns or unusual intersections, Bernal said. The data is then reviewed and labeled by 
data labelers at Tesla
 plants.
 
The position doesn't require a degree, but does stipulate that applicants must have ""a clean driving record, safe driving habits, and a minimum of 4 years of licensed driving experiences,"" according to the job listing.
 
Tesla has roles listed in over a dozen cities, including Austin, Texas, Denver, Colorado, and Brooklyn, New York.
 
The role pays between $18 to $48 per hour and includes benefits, according to the LinkedIn 
job posting
 for the Brooklyn role. New York state law requires companies 
post salary expectations
 in any 
advertisement
 for a role.
 
Tesla has come under fire in the past for data it has allegedly collected from its EV owners. Earlier this year, the company was 
hit by a class-action lawsuit
 from Tesla owners after 
Reuters reported
 Tesla employees had access to photos and videos captured by cameras used for Tesla's driving assistance programs, and 
sometimes shared and joked
 about the footage internally. Tesla did not comment on the issue.

He views owning Twitter as a way to be in control and have a prominent presence.,"By Ankita Chakravarti
: It is hard to keep Elon Musk away from Twitter but once, a Tesla board member took an extreme step to keep him away from tweeting. He snatched his phone locked it inside the cupboard. 
According to Elon Musk's biographer, some of his friends have taken extreme measures to stop him from tweeting late at night. One of his close friends, Tesla board member Antonio Gracias, once took away Musk's phone and locked it in a hotel safe. Gracias even punched in the code himself to ensure that Musk couldn't retrieve it and start tweeting again at 3 a.m. However, Musk eventually convinced hotel security to open the safe so he could resume tweeting, Business Insider reported.
The biographer mentioned that Musk seems almost addicted to the excitement that comes with Twitter. He views owning Twitter as a way to be in control and have a prominent presence. Despite efforts from friends, including his brother Kimbal Musk, to dissuade him from buying Twitter, Musk is strongly drawn to the platform. Gracias and Musk did not provide any comments on the matter.
It's unclear when Gracias attempted to secure Musk's phone, but it's worth noting that Musk has faced controversies due to his tweets in the past. In 2018, an investor advised him to avoid tweeting when he's upset. Musk faced backlash when he called a British cave diver who helped rescue trapped boys a derogatory term on Twitter. He later apologized, and the incident led to a defamation lawsuit, which Musk ultimately won.
During a trial related to his tweet about having ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private, evidence of an email exchange was revealed. In the email, the investor advised Musk to refrain from using Twitter as an outlet for his frustrations. Although Musk won the trial, both he and Tesla paid a $20 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018.
Even Twitter's new CEO has advised Musk against late-night tweeting, and Musk himself admitted that he should probably stop tweeting at 3 a.m. He acknowledged that he has made mistakes in the past and suggested saving controversial tweets as drafts and reviewing them the next day before deciding whether to post them.
Musk is known for his unfiltered nature, often displaying a juvenile sense of humor on Twitter. His tweets cover a wide range of topics, from crude humor and marijuana jokes to discussions about life on Mars and engaging in public feuds with figures like Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. These days he has been targeting Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg a lot. Musk is unhappy with him because he rolled out Twitter rival, Threads. Reacting to the new app, Musk tweeted, 'Competetion is fine, cheating is not'.

458,Tesla's Autopilot driver-assist system gets closer look as US seeks details on recent changes,Tom Krisher,2023-07-06 00:00:00,date,https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20230706/teslas-autopilot-driver-assist-system-gets-closer-look-as-us-seeks-details-on-recent-changes,dailyherald.com,"U.S. automobile safety regulators are zeroing in on changes that Tesla has made to its Autopilot partially automated driving system, including how it makes sure drivers pay attention and how it…","DETROIT U.S. automobile safety regulators are zeroing in on changes that Tesla has made to its Autopilot partially automated driving system, including how it makes sure drivers pay attention and how it detects and responds to objects.
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked for details of changes made to all versions of the system including dates and detailed descriptions, according to a post on its site Thursday.
 
The request is part of a larger investigation into why Teslas operating on Autopilot have struck emergency vehicles that are stopped along highways while they are responding to other incidents. It covers all versions of automated driving system including ""Full Self-Driving,"" which is being tested on public roads by Tesla owners.
 
The agency has been investigating crashes involving Teslas using the system since August of 2021. Investigators have sent teams to probe more than 30 crashes since 2016 that have caused at least 14 deaths.
 
In a letter dated July 3 and posted on the agency's website Thursday, NHTSA asks Tesla to describe all changes to the systems in the ""design, material composition, manufacture, quality control, supply, function, or installation of the subject system, from the start of production to date.""
 
Tesla must respond to the request by July 19, or it could face civil penalties, the letter states. It asks the electric vehicle maker to update a previous response dated Sept. 19 of last year.
 
 
 
 
by signing up you agree to our 
terms of service
 
 
 
 
A message was left early Thursday seeking comment from Tesla. The company says on its website that neither Autopilot nor ""Full Self-Driving"" can drive themselves and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.
 
The letter also asks for which Tesla vehicles had cameras installed in the cabin to monitor drivers, and whether the system uses ""Tesla Vision"" which relies only on cameras to view the road and does not use radar.
 
NHTSA's request includes changes that Tesla made as part of a February recall of ""Full Self-Driving"" software. NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with the software because the system can break traffic laws. The problem was to be fixed with an online software update.
 
NHTSA said in recall documents that the system can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to speed limit changes.
 
The documents said that Tesla does not agree with the agency's analysis of the problem. The company was to fix the problems with an online software update.
 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects to have fully autonomous vehicles this year, a pledge he has made for several years. ""The trend is very clearly toward full self-driving,"" Musk said in April. ""And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year.""
 
The system is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners.

459,Which electric cars can charge at a Tesla Supercharger?,Insider,2023-07-09 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/07/09/electric-cars-charge-tesla-supercharger-how/,autoblog.com,"Tesla's advantage has long been its charging technology and Supercharger network. Now, more and more automakers are switching to Tesla's charging tech. More car companies are shifting to Tesla's…","The difference between 
Tesla
 charging and non-Tesla charging. 
Electrify America; Tesla
 
 
 
A lot has hit the news cycle in recent months with regard to 
electric car
 drivers and where they can and can't plug in. The key factor in all of that? Whether automakers switched to Tesla's charging standard.
 
More car companies are shifting to Tesla's charging tech in the hopes of boosting their customers' confidence in going electric. 
 
Here's what it boils down to:
 
If you currently drive a Tesla,
 you can keep charging at Tesla charging locations, which use the company's North American Charging Standard (NACS), which has long served it well. The 
chargers
 are thinner, more lightweight and easier to wrangle than other brands. 
 
If you currently drive a non-Tesla EV
, you have to charge at a non-Tesla charging station like that of Electrify America or EVgo — which use the Combined Charging System (CCS) — unless you stumble upon a Tesla charger already equipped with the Magic Dock adapter. For years, CCS tech dominated EVs from everyone but Tesla. 
 
Starting next year, if you drive a non-Tesla EV (from the automakers that have announced they'll make the switch), you'll be able to charge at all Supercharger locations with an adapter. And by 2025, EVs from some automakers won't even need an adaptor. 
 
Here's how to charge up, depending on which EV you have: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cadillac
 Lyriq. 
Cadillac
 
 
 
 
 
GM
 will also allow its EV drivers to plug into Tesla stations.
 
Much like , GM EV drivers can start to use the Tesla charging network even before the automaker equips its cars with NACS.
 
Starting next year, whether you're driving a GMC 
Hummer
, Cadillac Lyriq, or other GM electric car, you can use a Tesla charger, so long as you have an adapter.
 
GM will build its EVs with the NACS port starting in 2025. From that point on, GM EV drivers won't need an adapter to charge at a Tesla location.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The  EX90. 

 
 
 
 
 
Current drivers of  EVs can start to use an adapter to use Tesla chargers sometime mid-next year.
 
Those who buy an electric  
starting in 2025
 can expect the cars will be made with the NACS port from then onward.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The 2025  4. 

 
 
 
 
 
The same rules apply for owners of 
 EVs.
 
You can start using the chargers in 2024 with an adapter, and expect the full experience a year later with a model year 2025 .
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The  EQS SUV. 

 
 
 
 
 
The German automaker just announced it will adopt Tesla's NACS.
 
 EV drivers will have access to the Tesla network via an adapter beginning next year.
 
Mercedes will implement the NACS port into its vehicles built starting in 2025. 
 
 
 
 
 Some automakers have not yet announced that they will make their EVs compatible with Tesla chargers. For example, Lucid is not planning on making the switch right away. 
 
 
 
 
 The 
Lucid Air
 Grand Touring Performance. 
Tim Levin/Insider
 
 
 
 
 
Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson recently said
 he's not yet convinced about the industry-wide switch to the Tesla NACS tech, but it's likely the startup will eventually follow suit. That means Lucid drivers have to charge at a location where CCS is readily available.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Jeep officially unveiled its first electric SUV, the Jeep 
Avenger
, at the 
Paris Motor Show
. 
Stellantis
 
 
 
 
 
The Jeep-maker told 
Reuters
 in a recent statement it would evaluate a potential switch to NACS.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The 2023  Ioniq 5. 

 
 
 
 
 

 said it is also considering it.
 
 
 
 
 It gets tricky when you look at other charging stations 
 
 
 
 
 Electrify America. 
Electrify America
 
 
 
 
 
Currently, non-Tesla EV drivers can plug in at an Electrify America or EVgo charger given both the vehicles and the stations are equipped to handle CCS-enabled charging.
 
Several charging companies are now planning to convert their equipment to NACS. (You can keep an eye on which companies that is with this 
helpful tracker from consultancy EVAdoption
.)
 
That means that for drivers of non-Tesla EVs, built with the NACS port in the future (for many of them, starting in 2025), these non-Tesla stations will also be able to accommodate them.
 
There's a lot to keep track of in the world of EV charging. But given how important 
charging
 is to an EV owner's experience, the space is bound to get more exciting in the coming years. 
 
Are you a non-Tesla EV owner? Are you planning to use the adapter to be able to charge at Tesla stations starting next year? Do you wish you waited to buy your EV until after it was built with the NACS port? Do you have a tip or opinion to share? Contact this reporter at astjohn@insider.com.

The milestone means that all the gigacasting and other manufacturing equipment has now been tested to be working as planned.

After months of Cybertruck prototypes spotted on the roads in Texas, California, and as far as New Zealand for the winter testing,  now has its assembly line in Austin ready and has made its first Cybertruck there as a living proof.

The caption reads ""First Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!"" and what the modest in terms of numbers but big in symbolism achievement means, is that  has all its gigacasting equipment, production line operators, and Cybertruck supply chain ducks in a row.

It could still take a couple of months to ramp up said manufacturing line for true mass production, but the first Cybertruck ready for delivery as soon as mid-July means that Elon Musk may keep his Cybertruck release promise for Q3. He mentioned that  will hold a big Cybertruck launch event towards the tail end of the quarter, likely in September, and that's when we may learn more about its price and specs, as well as the exact delivery date.

Recently, an analyst contradicted Wall Street's consensus that  can only build 160,000 Cybertrucks a year when production ramps, reminding that orders to suppliers stand at 375,000 total annual production at a price of at least US$60,000 per Cybertruck. That number still seems rather inflated, unless it's global manufacturing capacity at full throttle and  starts building the Cybertruck at places other than its Texas Gigafactory.

Still, so far everything with the Cybertruck's production and launch timeframe seems to be going according to plan.  is also preparing to break ground on its newest Gigafactory in Mexico any moment now, and that one is rumored to make Cybertruck components as well, so it will probably contribute to the production ramp.

Moreover, the current 1.8+ million Cybertruck preorder reservations will most likely translate into many times less actual orders when potential customers hear the final Cybertruck price and cut on the two or three reservations they plunked at $100 a refundable pop just in case.",notebookcheck.net,5474,finance,AT,en,Daniel Zlatev,https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/first_tesla_cybertruck_austin.jpg,False,,7.3338614,a107fe037bc2b511c056fe89550d3771

The company tweeted a photo on Saturday showing scores of workers in helmets and yellow vests surrounding the truck.
 
'First Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!' Tesla tweeted, including a cowboy hat-wearing emoji. Owner Elon Musk retweeted the post.
 
Musk unveiled the truck in late 2019, and Tesla had said production would start in late 2021, although the company has since cautioned that production would begin slowly and in smaller numbers than Tesla's other vehicles. 
 
With its wedge shape and stainless-steel body — which Tesla calls the exoskeleton — the Cybertruck looks nothing like a traditional pickup. Some analysts have panned it as a niche product that won't have broad appeal.
 
Musk said in April that the company expected to deliver the first truck probably in the July-through-September quarter. He said that as with other new products, production would start slowly and then speed up.
 
'It takes time to get the manufacturing line going,' he said, 'and this is really a very radical product. It's not made in the way that other cars are made. So let's see.'
 
The truck's 2019 unveiling 
veered off course
 when a window that was touted as unbreakable was spider-cracked when hit by a big metal ball, which prompted an expletive from Musk.
 
Tesla originally said it would make three versions of the truck, ranging from about $40,000 to $70,000. Later the company removed prices from the page where customers can decide whether to plunk down $100 and place an order.
 
Competitors have rushed into the electric truck market, including the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian Automotive's R1T. Both look like conventional pickups.
 
Tesla is scheduled to report second-quarter financial results on July 19.

Veteran short-seller Jim Chanos has taken aim at Tesla's self-driving technology, saying the add-on offering probably has near-zero value in the resale market for cars.
 
""The current value of the $TSLA ""Full Self Driving"" package is probably close to zero in the retail market. #RealityCheck,"" Chanos tweeted, responding to a tech reviewer.
 
""Remember that Musk has said that owning an FSD package will increase the value of your $TSLA vehicle by multiples of the FSD package cost itself. Yet ascribes almost no value to it upon repurchase. In fact, over time it 
depreciates
 faster than the vehicle itself,""  he added.
 
Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) kit costs $15,000 to install in the company's 
electric vehicles
, and buyers are treated as beta testers whose feedback improves the technology. So far, around 100,000 people have chosen to add the feature.
 
As the software is constantly being updated, there runs the risk that buyers may find themselves saddled with obsolete technology that has little or no resale value on the 
used car
 market. 
 
Elon Musk has for years promised fully-autonomous, self-driving Teslas, although this bold claim has not yet materialized. He claims that  ""level 5"" capability – that is, total autonomy – will arrive ""later this year"", but he hasn't given further details.
 
Tesla's goal to achieve level 5 is one of the factors behind its $869 billion market cap and has been swept up in the 
stock market's
 excitement surrounding the AI boom. 
 
But Chanos, whose reputation as an investment manager was built upon sniffing out fraud on Wall Street and launching successful bets against offending companies, hasn't minced words about Tesla's FSD tech. 
 
The veteran Wall Street voice is known for his successful short bets on Enron, Wirecard, and Hertz Corporation, and he has repeatedly outed Musk and Tesla for various shortcomings over the past year. 
 
But so far in 2023, Tesla continues to defy Chanos's bearish approach. The stock has more than doubled this year as it rides the wave of enthusiasm over the rise of 
generative
 AI. Still, the carmaker is currently trading at around $270 – well below its 2021 peak of over $400.

philippines' marcos signs $9 bn wealth fund into law as uk housing costs soar, anxiety grips homeowners and renters: 'i'm in meltdown'

The company had raised $128 million in September 2021 in an effort to expand as it rode a boom in the e-bike sector after the Covid pandemic prompted people to seek alternatives means of transportation.

But it has struggled since then, with Dutch media saying it was plagued by bad publicity as bikes broke down frequently and repairs took too long.

The Amsterdam firm lost almost 80 million euros ($90 million) in 2021 and the same figure last year, according to financial daily Het Financieele Dagblad (FD).

An Amsterdam court granted the company a stay of payment last week after VanMoof filed for protection from creditors.

But the firm said the court withdrew the suspension of payment proceeding of VanMoof's Dutch legal entities on Monday and ""declared these entities bankrupt.""

VanMoof added that its legal entities outside the Netherlands are not in insolvency proceedings.

Two administrators were appointed as trustees.

The trustees ""are investigating the possibilities of a re-start out of bankruptcy by means of an asset sale to a third party, so that the activities of VanMoof can be continued,"" the company said in a statement.

Just as I wrote yesterday, 4,560s aren't to be visited today – 4,585 would put up a good fight if need be – all depends upon any selling stampeded at the open developing or not. Odds are that it wouldn't be anything serious, and ES would proceed on the journey to the high 4,590s followed by low 4,610s.

Unemployment claims and Philly Fed manufacturing are unlikely to rock the 'no recession coming' boat either, and that means real lasting selling pressure is unlikely to develop in the first half of today's session.

The results will be a barometer for how well 
a series of price cuts
 are working in an increasingly crowded market, in which legacy car makers and start-ups are constantly introducing alternatives to the Model 3 and Model Y, Tesla's two workhorse vehicles.
Mr Koney said he was thinking more about three years from now, when he expects next-generation Tesla cars will be rolling off a newly built assembly line in Mexico. He sees those models being made cheaply at high volumes, putting investors such as Jennison in line for another Musk windfall.
How he spotted Tesla early
Mr Koney had no real background in the car industry when he first encountered Tesla. He was born in Ghana and spent part of his childhood in Gambia. His father was a judge, and his mom worked for Ghana Airways. After studying economics and political science at Williams College, he got his first job in finance as an aerospace analyst at UBS Group.
Jennison, an affiliate manager of PGIM with about $US175 billion under management, hired Mr Koney in 2007 to cover the industrial sector. Two years later, the analyst embarked on a nationwide tour of the EV ecosystem to understand why one of the companies he followed, Johnson Controls, was considering building a lithium-ion battery business. One of the start-ups he visited impressed him so much that he began forming a whole new investment idea.
When Mr Koney met with Tesla at its retail store in Silicon Valley, Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's then-chief financial officer, said the company would first break into the market at the high end, where consumers were willing to pay a premium for an EV. Then they would drive downmarket as quickly as possible, increasing volume and lowering the price of each successive model.
Mr Koney came away bullish, but Tesla still faced a lot of risks. He kept a close watch on the company as it gained a stronger footing. In April 2010, the car maker received a low-interest $US465 million loan from the US Department of Energy – a lifeline as it was creating the Model S. A month later, Tesla bought a shuttered factory once owned by a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota. That June, Tesla went public at $US17 a share, valuing the company at about $US1.7 billion.
‘He had a deep understanding'
Mr Koney met more executives, including its then-chief technology officer, JB Straubel, and its head designer, Franz von Holzhausen. By 2011, he was convinced Tesla was 'for real' and that it was time for him to pitch Jennison on the idea.
'Owuraka believed that Tesla was going to revolutionise the auto industry,' said Kathleen McCarragher, head of growth equity at Jennison. 'He had a deep understanding of the significance of Tesla's competitive advantages.'
Among the factors Mr Koney highlighted to the team was that Tesla had created its own battery system, had structural cost advantages compared with traditional car makers and had a 'unique company culture that could create innovative solutions', Ms McCarragher said.
Jennison owns more than 20 million Tesla shares, making it one of the company's largest investors. The asset manager declined to say how profitable its bet on Tesla has been over the years, citing compliance issues. The stock has gained more than 135 per cent this year and is up 14,853 per cent since mid-2011, when Jennison first disclosed its initial shareholding in a regulatory filing.
For nearly a dozen years, Mr Koney has ridden the waves of stomach-churning volatility, a similar experience to the other company he pegged as a potential behemoth early in his time at Jennison: Netflix. Few stocks are as polarising as Tesla, and each day begins with absorbing the news flow, checking Reddit and 'aggressive lurking' on Twitter.
Disagreements with Musk
Some of the ups and downs have been triggered by Mr Musk himself, and behind the scenes, Mr Koney has found himself in disagreements with the multibillionaire.
In 2016, Tesla wanted to acquire SolarCity, a rooftop solar-panel installer run by Mr Musk's cousins. Some investors balked: Tesla was in the throes of working on the Model 3, its first mass-market car, and the deal seemed ill-timed.
As Tesla lobbied shareholders for support, the company arranged for a phone conversation between Mr Koney and Mr Musk. The analyst was rushing home to his infant daughter when the call from the CEO came through. His mother, who had been helping with childcare, picked up as Mr Koney walked in the door and told him 'this guy called Elon' was on the phone.
Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the SolarCity deal; Jennison voted against it. Solar still is not a big part of Tesla's energy business, where much of the excitement is focused on the company's Megapack batteries for utilities.
'I was not a fan of that deal, and I'm still not,' Mr Koney said. 'I like Elon. But I'm not a fanboy, per se. We don't just sign off on everything.'
By 2018, Tesla was in a manufacturing ramp-up period so taxing and capital intensive, Mr Musk called it 'production hell'. According to the CEO's retelling, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy, and key executives quit.
The turning point
That was also the year Mr Musk infamously tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $US420, and had 'funding secured'. Mr Koney shot Tesla an email and was ultimately deposed by investors who sued Mr Musk in federal court (the transcript of the analyst's deposition is sealed).
Early 2019 was equally rough: Tesla closed stores and missed delivery targets, and Mr Ahuja left. But Mr Koney saw the second quarter of the year as a turning point: Tesla became cash-flow positive, proving it could build the Model 3 and make money. It is still the only US company with a profitable EV business.
Tesla is not immune to risks. The company itself says it is highly dependent on Mr Musk, who is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies. In October, he acquired Twitter for $US44 billion. This month, 
he announced the leadership team for xAI
, his latest start-up.
'Elon is a big driver for Tesla's success,' said Mr Koney. 'The less time he spends on Twitter and the more time he spends on Tesla, I'm happy.'
The biggest recent takeaway
In March, Tesla gave a lengthy investor presentation at the company's headquarters and factory in Austin, and Mr Musk shared the stage with several other executives. Mr Koney was there in person, paying close attention to the more than 160 slides that Tesla showed.
Besides the breadth of executive talent, Mr Koney's biggest takeaway was the 'unboxed' assembly process that Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, highlighted. He said the company would move away from complex and cumbersome methods the industry has used for more than a century, eliminating hundreds of parts and simplifying assembly processes. Mr Koney believes Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, could ultimately be put to work on production lines to install seats and interior panels.
That could reduce costs, which would be especially helpful as Mr Musk slashes prices of Tesla models to keep growing sales as other car makers release waves of competing electric vehicles.
While those cuts will pressure profit margins, Mr Musk has said the company could make so much money on autonomous-driving software in the future, it does not need to make upfront returns on vehicle sales. The CEO has long made lofty claims about AI-powered cars that have not come to pass.
Mr Koney thinks that Full Self-Driving Beta – Tesla's name for its driver-assistance software – is getting incrementally better, and requiring less input from the driver. He should know: He has a Model X with FSD Beta and often drives it in Manhattan.
'It's extremely cautious around pedestrians, which it should be,' Mr Koney said. 'There's a ways to go before FSD works in a city like New York, let alone a place like Mumbai.'
 bullish for Mr Koney is the fact Tesla is building a new factory in Mexico that will make its next-generation cars.
Though details are scant – vehicles were shrouded under white sheets during its investor day – Tesla expects them to be winning products. The company wants to make 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 and will need cheaper, high-volume models to get there.
It is a far cry from 2009, when Mr Koney was excited about the fledging EV maker but much of Wall Street questioned whether the company was viable.
'When I look at Tesla today, I'm no longer worried about survival,' said Mr Koney. 'It's just a question of how successful they will be.'

Tesla chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk first announced the futuristic looking electric pick-up truck to great fanfare in 2019.

The company had initially promised that the Cybertruck would be available to buy in 2021. But Tesla has repeatedly pushed back production, citing global shortages of components.

In May of this year, Musk said that Tesla plans to eventually produce 250,000 Cybertrucks each year, depending on consumer demand for the unusual looking vehicle.

The Cybertruck is expected to compete against other electric pick-up trucks from Ford Motor Co. (F) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN), both of which have already launched electric models.

Tesla now says that the Cybertruck should enter mass production by the end of this year.

Tesla reported a jump in second-quarter profits Wednesday as a series of price cuts translated into sharply higher car sales.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle company reported profits of $2.7 billion, up 20 percent on the year-ago level.

While profit margins fell from the prior quarter following price cuts, the results still topped analyst estimates.

Revenues surged 47 percent to $24.9 billion -- a record for the company.

""We are excited that we were able to achieve such results given the macroeconomic environment we are currently in,"" said Tesla, which pointed to cost-cutting efforts and new plant capacity in Texas and Germany as helping to propel the results.

Musk has undertaken multiple price cuts throughout 2023 on vehicles, telling investors in April that the company has ""taken the view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.""

The move comes as more EVs from legacy carmakers like General Motors and Ford are hitting dealerships.

On Monday, Ford announced price cuts of as much as $10,000 on the F-150 Lightning, an electric version of the best-selling pickup, a move that added to concerns about an oversupply of EVs amid consumer anxiety over lack of charging capacity.

The Ford announcement added to concerns about a potential glut of EVs. EVs currently have more than 100 days of inventory, while industry-wide levels are 53 days, according to a Cox Automotive report.

Shares of Tesla have more than doubled in 2023 so far as investors have overlooked concerns about shrinking profit margins and cheered other recent Musk initiatives.

On Saturday, Tesla unveiled from its Texas factory its first Cybertruck, a futuristic silver vehicle that has been eagerly awaited.

In recent weeks, Musk has also announced collaborations with other auto giants including General Motors and Ford to open up use of Tesla's respected EV charging network.

In March, Musk announced a major new factory in Mexico. He has also met recently with both French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi about potential investments.

Investors are keen to hear more about the production ramp-up for the Cybertruck, said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson.

""We think a lot of positive news is priced in,"" Nelson told AFP ahead of the earnings.

In its press release, Tesla said the Cybertruck ""remains on track for initial deliveries this year.""

The auto company also confirmed its production target of 1.8 million vehicles for all of 2023.

""One day it seems like the world economy is falling apart, next day it's fine. I don't know what the hell is going on,"" Musk told analysts on a conference call. ""We're in, I would call it, turbulent times.""

Tesla shares, which had been largely flat after hours, fell nearly 5 per cent after Musk's comments.

The large price cuts have pressured Tesla's automotive gross margin, a closely watched indicator in the industry, but Musk has said Tesla would sacrifice margin to drive volume growth.

He said so again on Wednesday: ""I think it makes it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favour of making more vehicles,"" adding that if macroeconomic conditions were not stable, Tesla would have to lower prices.

As an example, Tesla this year cut US prices of its Model Y long-range version by a quarter to $50,490.

Tesla's quarterly automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, fell to 18.1 per cent in the second quarter from 19 per cent in the first quarter, according to Reuters' calculations. That was in line with Street estimates, but a far cry from the 26% it reported a year earlier.

Tesla reported overall gross margin of 18.2 per cent for the April-June period, the lowest in 16 quarters.

Earlier, Tesla said in a statement it was focusing on reducing costs and on new product development, and that the ""challenges of these uncertain times are not over.""

""Multiple rounds of aggressive price cuts has put Tesla in a position of strength after building its EV castle and now is set to further monetize its success,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note.

Tesla reiterated its expectations of achieving deliveries of around 1.8 million vehicles this year, but said production in the third quarter would decrease slightly due to planned downtimes for factory upgrades.

""It's a fine line,"" said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, which holds Tesla stock.

""They are trying to get the prices right so they can generate the demand for the units, and then they like to run their factories as efficiently as they can ... they don't want to build up those inventories.""

Lower pricing, along with government tax breaks for EV buyers in the United States and elsewhere, drove Tesla's deliveries to a record 466,000 vehicles in the April-July period globally, but ate into its profitability.

Tesla announced revenue of $24.93 billion U.S. for Q2 versus $24.47 billion U.S. expected among Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

Earnings per share came in at $0.91 U.S. compared to $0.82 U.S. that was forecast.

Net income rose 20% to $2.70 billion U.S., but operating income declined 3% from a year ago to $2.40 billion U.S.

During a call with analysts and media, Tesla chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk failed to provide a start date for deliveries of the company's highly anticipated Cybertruck, as well as for a long gestating robotaxi.

Musk also said that Tesla's vehicle production would slow down during the current third quarter due to shutdowns for factory improvements.

Tesla continues to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries for all of this year. Earlier in July, Tesla reported 466,140 total vehicle deliveries for Q2.

The Q2 deliveries were driven largely by price discounts and other incentives. Consequently, operating margins came in at 9.6%, the lowest level for the last five quarters.

Total gross margins at Tesla during Q2 stood at 18.2%, also a recent low for the company.

Musk said on the earnings call that Tesla plans to spend more than $1 billion U.S. on'Dojo,' a supercomputer that the company is developing for artificial intelligence (A.I.) machine learning.

Rival automakers pouncing on booming demand for electric vehicles pose the biggest challenge for Tesla over the next two years just as Elon Musk appears distracted thanks to his high-profile ventures, from social media and space travel to artificial intelligence.
So say respondents to the latest Markets Live Pulse survey. Out of 630 global MLIV Pulse contributors, 54% flagged the heightened risk of industry competition while 26% picked the behavior and decisions of its mercurial chief as a key concern for Tesla shareholders.
'Musk is just such an unpredictable person, that I would count it among one of the top risks for Tesla,' Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management, said in an interview.
As profit margins thin, some 67% of survey participants said the billionaire executive should focus more on the carmaker. Their warning comes in the wake of a seemingly improbable 128% Tesla rally this year, fueled by renewed investor appetite for the tech megacaps and Musk's prediction that the era of fully autonomous vehicles is nigh.
Even though Tesla currently enjoys sizable lead over other companies, be it an established carmaker or a startup, a big part of its remarkably high market valuation rests on the assumption that it will be able to maintain this dominance in a future where EVs are more commonplace.
Yet Tesla rivals are picking up the pace. Just earlier this month, China's BYD Co. set a sales record for the second quarter, and delivered 352,163 fully electric vehicles. That shows how rapidly it has gained ground on Tesla, which handed over 466,140 EVs to customers worldwide — also an all-time high.
The counterargument goes that a slew of Tesla's rivals are still struggling with teething issues. For instance, Ford Motor Co.'s US electric vehicle sales fell in the second quarter, after it had to pause production early this year at the Mexican factory that builds the Mustang Mach-E.
Despite that, analysts and investors warn that Tesla's current advantage can erode quickly as government policies like the US's Inflation Reduction Act encourage other automakers to embrace EVs. With competitors stepping up their game, Tesla's famously expensive shares — trading at 75 times forward earnings — leave little room for error. In comparison, GM trades at about 6 times of estimated profits and Ford at about 9 times.
'Competition is the most important risk factor for Tesla longer term, and even mediocre execution for the crop of around 100 new EVs coming to market this year will put pressure on Tesla,' said Craig Irwin, analyst at Roth Capital Partners. 'The current lead over competition is very real, but we need to understand how this shrinks.'
Defending the market share comes with a cost. Around 63% of the MLIV Pulse respondents expect the company to continue to lower prices in order to capture higher volumes. As a result, its hefty profit margin is already taking a hit. More cuts will likely leave the margins even thinner, and narrow the gap with other auto companies.
The impact of all the recent price cuts on Tesla's profits will be clear this Wednesday when the company reports second-quarter results. The average profit estimate for the quarter has come down 29% from where they were six months ago.
'Winning stocks grow revenue and margins. Both are necessary,' said Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research.
Meanwhile the 'Musk-risk' embedded in Tesla shares came into a sharp focus last year when the billionaire engaged in a highly public bid for social-media platform Twitter, and sold off big chunks of Tesla stock to pay for the acquisition. The pressure from the sales and worries that Musk had become too distracted to run Tesla weighed heavily on the shares at that time.
Since then, Twitter's own value has dwindled as well. About 67% of the survey respondents said they don't expect Twitter will ever be worth as much as Musk paid for it.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate 
Tesla
 and its board over conflicts of interest and for negatively impacting shareholders by failing to act independently from CEO Elon Musk. 
 
The Democratic lawmaker took aim at Musk's split leadership of Tesla and Twitter, arguing that this has led to conflicts of interests and misappropriation of corporate assets.
 
""Despite recent and repeated calls from investors to address these actions, the Board appears to have failed to uphold its legal duty to ensure that Mr. Musk act in the best interest of Tesla,"" she wrote, addressing the letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
 
Further, Warren noted the board's possible lack of independence from Musk, citing close relationships between the CEO and several board members. 
 
Together with the fact that the board failed to disclose their concerns over Musk's dual roles with Tesla shareholders, this could constitute a violation of securities law, she wrote.
 
Warren's letter is an extension of long-standing frustration among Tesla investors, who have lamented Musk's takeover of Twitter as a serious distraction from his obligations to the 
electric vehicle
 maker.
 
In April, 
17 major stakeholders
 in Tesla shared an open letter to the firm's board, citing similar grievances, which they said jeopardized the company's value. Meanwhile, Warren previously 
warned the board
 in December that Musk must not treat Tesla as a ""private plaything.""
 
Warren reiterated these concerns in the lastest letter to the SEC. They include Musk's transfer of Tesla employees to help with Twitter — a potentially involuntary move — and his ability to use the platform to boost Tesla's 
advertising
 ahead of other car manufacturers.
 
Tesla's investors also saw Musk's desire for Twitter as directly detrimental to the carmaker's stock, citing that Tesla lost $582.4 billion in market capitalization a year after Musk disclosed his initial stake in the social media company.
 
After complaints arose from shareholders, Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, formerly head of advertising at Comcast's NBCUniversal, to take over as CEO of Twitter. However, Warren notes that this is not enough, as Musk ""is likely to retain 'significant control' over the company and intends to continue overseeing core functions of the business.""
 
Moreover, she points out that there is nothing to stop Musk from firing Yaccarino.
 
Neither Tesla nor the SEC responded immediately to a request for comment. Twitter automatically responded with the 
poop emoji
, in accordance to a policy implemented under Musk.

Tesla shared a peak into the Cybertruck's ginormous windshield wipers in action on Wednesday in the company's latest 
earnings release
.
 
A photo from the release titled ""Built To Do Real Work"" shows that the massive, clunky wiper only clears a little more than half of the Cybertruck's windshield.
 
 
 
 Tesla gave a first look at its giant windshield wiper in action. 
Tesla
 
 
 
Similarly, Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen shared a picture of the windshield earlier this year that appeared to show the wipers were 
unable to clear
 a significant portion of the passenger side of the window.
 
The windshield wiper is perhaps the largest Tesla has put on the 
truck
. Unlike most cars' wipers, which tuck neatly against the hood, the Cybertruck's wiper appears to rest upright along the side of the windshield when it's not in use.
 
In the past, 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk
 has said there's 
""no easy solution""
 to the vehicle's massive windshield. The 
initial 2019 design
 for the Cybertruck didn't even include windshield wipers.
 
It's unclear whether the windshield wiper from the photo will be included in the final product, as the Cybertruck is still undergoing testing for ""final certification and validation,"" according to Tesla. The company said in the earnings release that the vehicle is still on track to begin deliveries within the year.
 
Last week, Tesla shared that the company had 
made its first production Cybertruck
 at its Texas Gigafactory. Musk first 
unveiled
 the concept for the 
electric pickup truck
 about four years ago and the project has faced a 
series of delays
 over the past two years.

Elon Musk has heard you, Tesla owners. 
 
Musk on Wednesday announced a solution to one of his customers' biggest gripes — but the deal won't last long.
 
For a limited time, he said, Tesla owners will be able to transfer their expensive 
Full Self-Driving package
 to a new Tesla. He announced the move in response to an investor question during 
Tesla's second-quarter earnings call
. 
 
""Yeah, this is a question we get asked a lot,"" Musk said. ""So we're excited to announce that for 
Q3
 we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a one-time amnesty, so you need to take advantage of it in Q3,""
 
""I hope this makes people happy,"" he added with a chuckle. 
 
Tesla charges $15,000 for a suite of driver-assistance features it calls Full Self-Driving (FSD). The system, which relies on an array of cameras to watch the road, has been in the prototype phase for years and still can't actually drive a car all on its own reliably. As they've waited for FSD to live up to its name, Tesla owners have long complained that they aren't able to hang onto the pricey, experimental feature when they 
trade in
 for a 
new car
. 
 
For years, Musk has 
claimed that FSD would be able to drive completely autonomously
 any day now, adding to the frustration among some owners. Clips shared online show that FSD Beta still drives inconsistently, sometimes navigating complex routes without human intervention and sometimes 
botching the most basic driving maneuvers
. 
 
All the while, Tesla has raised the price of FSD by thousands of dollars. 
 
The move could help juice sales right when Tesla needs it most. Musk on Wednesday warned that Tesla's production would slow down in the third quarter due to planned factory upgrades. Moreover, Tesla faces mounting competition from established car manufacturers diving headfirst into the electric market.

The company tweeted a photo on Saturday showing scores of workers in helmets and yellow vests surrounding the truck.


What You Need To Know




Tesla says its first electric pickup has rolled off the assembly line. Elon Musk's company tweeted a photo Saturday showing scores of workers in helmets and yellow vests surrounding the vehicle, which Tesla calls the Cybertruck




The truck is behind schedule. Back in 2019, Tesla said production would start in late 2021




The truck has a stainless-steel body and sharp angles that give it a different look. Some analysts say it's a niche product that won't have broad appeal




 Meanwhile, competitors like Ford and Rivian are already delivering electric pickups




 


'First Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!' Tesla tweeted, including a cowboy hat-wearing emoji. Owner Elon Musk retweeted the post.


Musk unveiled the truck in late 2019, and Tesla had said production would start in late 2021, although the company has since cautioned that production would begin slowly and in smaller numbers than Tesla's other vehicles.


With its wedge shape and stainless-steel body — which Tesla calls the exoskeleton — the Cybertruck looks nothing like a traditional pickup. Some analysts have panned it as a niche product that won't have broad appeal.


Musk said in April that the company expected to deliver the first truck probably in the July-through-September quarter. He said that as with other new products, production would start slowly and then speed up.


'It takes time to get the manufacturing line going,' he said, 'and this is really a very radical product. It's not made in the way that other cars are made. So let's see.'


The truck's 2019 unveiling 
veered off course
 when a window that was touted as unbreakable was spider-cracked when hit by a big metal ball, which prompted an expletive from Musk.


Tesla originally said it would make three versions of the truck, ranging from about $40,000 to $70,000. Later the company removed prices from the page where customers can decide whether to plunk down $100 and place an order.


Competitors have rushed into the electric truck market, including the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian Automotive's R1T. Both look like conventional pickups.

Total revenue rose 47% to $24.93 billion.,"SAN FRANCISCO:  Elon Musk's big bet that Tesla price cuts could boost sales and profits amid increasing competition and poor economic sentiment appears to be yielding mixed results. Sales jumped and the company beat analyst expectations for net income in the April-June quarter, although the company's profit margins declined. Tesla shares followed suit in after-hours trading.
 
The Austin, Texas, maker of electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries reported net income of $2.7 billion in the quarter, a 20% increase from a year ago. Earnings per share also rose 20% to 78 cents when measured via generally accepted accounting principles. Total revenue rose 47% to $24.93 billion.
 
Analysts, however, tend to focus on Tesla's own measurement of profit, which excludes stock-based compensation expense. By that measure, Tesla's net income zoomed to $3.15 billion, or 91 cents a share, sharply exceeding average analyst estimates of 80 cents per share according to FactSet. Some analysts had expected profits to fall because of the price cuts.
 
Tesla shares, however, initially stayed flat at roughly $292 in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings report, up a smidgeon from their close at $291.26. As Tesla executives spoke to analysts in a conference call, shares slipped more than 4%.
 
Tesla reported strong vehicle delivery numbers on July 2, saying they rose 83% compared to the year-earlier quarter after the company cut prices several times on its four electric vehicle models. Tesla sold a record 466,140 vehicles worldwide from April through June, nearly double the 254,695 it sold during the same period a year earlier.
 
The vast majority of those sales involved Tesla's popular Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs.
 
But the earnings report provided mixed messages on one of the larger questions facing Tesla: whether the automaker's discounting strategy can boost sales while preserving its profit margins. Tesla's operating margin, which represents how efficiently sales are turned into pretax profits, fell to 9.6% in the April-June quarter, down significantly from 14.6% a year earlier. The measure had also declined sharply in the January-March quarter.
 
While pressures on profitability and pricing continue to weigh on Tesla, Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones, said he took heart from some management comments about cost control and said the company's overall trajectory remains sound.
 
'The long-term drivers for growth remain in place and there are just going to be some near-term headwinds in the current environment we're in,' he said.
 
In the company's conference call with analysts, Musk praised the company's performance despite high-interest rates and what he called significant economic uncertainty, then quickly changed the subject to Tesla's advanced projects such as its so-called 'full self-driving' software.
 
Despite the name, Tesla cars with the software enabled cannot drive themselves, and the company warns drivers that they have to be ready to intervene at all times. Musk extolled Tesla's work on a new machine-learning system it calls Dojo that the company plans to use for improving its self-driving software.
 
Musk also said that Tesla should deliver its long-promised Cybertruck — an unusual-looking pickup with an angular design that might not look out of place in a 'Mad Max' movie — by the end of the year. Tesla announced Saturday that the first Cybertruck had rolled off the assembly line.
 
But analysts aren't convinced that the vehicle will be widely available any time soon, not least because other automakers have already unveiled more conventional-looking electric pickups such as the Ford F-150 Lightning.
 
'I don't think we'll see any meaningful volumes, certainly not this year,' said Seth Goldstein, an analyst with Morningstar Research. 'Not even next year. Maybe we're looking more into 2025, 26, 27 until we see them.'

489,Elon Musk Loses $20 Billion In 1 Day After Saying Tesla Could Keep Cutting Car Prices To Boost Sales,MENAFN,2023-07-21 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106642477/Elon-Musk-Loses-20-Billion-In-1-Day-After-Saying-Tesla-Could-Keep-Cutting-Car-Prices-To-Boost-Sales,menafn.com,The world's richest man Elon Musk lost a whopping $20 billion overnight after saying tesla could keep cutting prices amidst 'turbulent times'.,"On the real-time billionaires' lists of both Forbes and Bloomberg, the Tesla CEO came right on top of the biggest losers as of July 21.

While he remains the wealthiest person on earth, Musk's net worth dropped by $20.3 billion to $234 billion in just one day, based on Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The Forbes' list also indicated a loss of $18.4 billion, putting his wealth at $238.4 billion as recorded at 5pm EST (1am, UAE time) of prior trading day,

The big blow narrowed the gap between Musk and the next richest person in the world, Bernard Arnault, chairman of luxury goods maker LVMH. Arnault and his family's net worth climbed $952 million to $235.2 billion, based on Forbes' real-time list.

Musk's massive loss came as Tesla's shares tumbled 9.74 per cent - its biggest one-day percentage drop since April 20 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a slump in its second-quarter gross margins to a four-year low. The CEO's hint at more price cuts to boost sales didn't help at all.

The Tesla chief signalled on Wednesday that he would slash prices again on electric vehicles, even as his all-out price war on automaker rivals squeezes the company's own margins.

The company has pulled down prices several times since late last year, and increased discounts and other incentives to reduce inventory, as it tries to shield against competition and economic uncertainty.

""One day it seems like the world economy is falling apart, next day it's fine. I don't know what the hell is going on,"" Musk told analysts earlier. ""We're in, I would call it, turbulent times.""

Although revenue will rise in the long term, the near-term risks spooked Tesla shareholders. Volume soared to 173 million shares on July 20.

Tesla posted operating margins falling to 9.6% in Q2, down from 11.4% in Q1 and below 14.6% a year ago. Two years ago, the GAAP operating margin was 20.8%. The weaker economy and an influx of EV makers are pressuring the firm.

Catalysts

If Tesla begins manufacturing in India, it will boost both employment and the EV sector. However, Elon Musk's badgering for India to bend the rules to accommodate Tesla's demands should not be forgotten. After months of push-and-pull, Tesla decided to abandon its India plans last year after the government made it clear it would not relax its import duty structure for fully imported units. Tesla wanted to import its models from its Shanghai factory to test the market, insisting on a 40% duty compared to the generally applicable 60% for models priced below Rs 40 lakh.
 
The Union government rightly told off Musk that its import policies were made to encourage investment in India, and Tesla building an assembly plant to knock together imported models gave no benefit to the country. The Tesla story has now revived after Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the latter's recent visit to the US in June.
 
Meanwhile, India's EV market is just 2% of the overall automobile market, but it is expanding rapidly. It also offers considerable choices from high-end BMWs at Rs 1.2 crore to the popular Tata Nexon EV at Rs 14.5 lakh, or even an MG Comet at Rs 8 lakh. Tesla will be pitching for a period of imports before setting up complete manufacturing in India. It will also want other concessions like cheap land. However, the commerce minister must ensure a level playing field between Tesla and the other domestic and foreign EV-makers. After all, Tesla's pioneering days are over, and it is one among many—and that too in the luxe category.

494,Tesla's secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints,STEVE STECKLOW,2023-07-27 00:00:00,date,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/,reuters.com,"About a decade ago, Tesla rigged the dashboard readouts in its electric cars to provide 'rosy' projections of how far owners can drive before needing to recharge, a source told Reuters.","AUSTIN, Texas


In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan's advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.


He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.


'We're looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,' he said of his dashboard range meter.


Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that 'remote diagnostics' had determined his battery was fine, and then: 'We would like to cancel your visit.'


What Ponsin didn't know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a 'Diversion Team' in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.


The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company's advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.
 
Inside the Nevada team's office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.


Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.


In most cases, the complaining customers' cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars' own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company's vehicles.


Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.
 
 
Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.
 


Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles' potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers 'rosy' projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.


Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a 'safety buffer,' allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.


The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.


'Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,' the person said, adding: 'When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.'


Tesla's intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.


Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.
 
At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, models 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the roadster, along with a 'cybertruck' pickup.


Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.


Tesla was fined
 earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.


Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars' dashboard range meters didn't change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.


Recurrent found that Tesla's four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent's chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla's range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.


Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver's lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.


Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a 
'Range Tips'
 section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.


Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that's always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system's range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are 'more realistic,' they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.


Recurrent tested other automakers' in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona's range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.


Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: 'That's where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.'
 
Failed tests and false advertising


Tesla isn't the only automaker with cars that don't regularly achieve their advertised ranges.


One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a 
study
 of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.


The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.


The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.


Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.
 
 
'They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.'
 


EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model's range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.


Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA's formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.


Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA's formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. 'We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,' the German carmaker said in a statement.


Ford and Porsche didn't respond to requests for comment.
 
Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.


EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars' estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla's range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.


The EPA said it has seen 'everything' in its audits of EV manufacturers' range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. 'That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes' auditing them, the agency said.


The EPA cautioned that individuals' actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.


Pannone called Tesla 'the most aggressive' electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.


'I'm not suggesting they're cheating,' Pannone said of Tesla. 'What they're doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.'


Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.


All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.


Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla's in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.


Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds 
reported in March 2021
. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.


Edmunds has 
continued to test electric vehicles
, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.


'They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,' Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can 'misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.'


South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars' range. It cited tests by the country's environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company's claimed ranges in cold weather.


The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla's website, including one that claimed about a particular model: 'You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.' Regulators required Tesla to remove the 'or longer' phrase.


Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging 'false/exaggerated advertising.'
 
Creating a diversion


By last year, sales of Tesla's electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.


As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team's operations.


Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its 'virtual' service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.


Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla 'Virtual Service Advisor' described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: 'Divert customers who do not require in person service.'
 
Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas 'Diversion Team' to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.


The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office's operations.


Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers' cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range.

SHANGHAI -- The Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory began to export its car model, Model Y (Rear-Wheel Drive), to the Republic of Korea recently, marking the first time for the Tesla vehicles made in China to enter the ROK market, said the company.
 
Previously, Tesla vehicles exported to the ROK were produced in its Fremont factory in the United States.
 
The Shanghai plant recorded a global delivery volume of 476,500 vehicles in the first half of this year, which is equivalent to about two-thirds of its total delivery volume last year. Currently, a vehicle can be rolled off the production line in less than 40 seconds in the plant, and over 95 percent of the auto parts can be supplied locally.
 
Besides, the Shanghai factory exported vehicles to Thailand for the first time earlier this year. Car models, including Model 3 and Model Y, made in the factory, have been delivered to Thailand since the beginning of this year, according to the company.

The latest apparent example was reported this week 
by Reuters
: For years, 
Tesla
 reportedly has exaggerated the maximum range of the electric cars it sells. When customers' range complaints overwhelmed the company's service team, according to Reuters, Tesla created a special team to cancel those appointments and tell drivers that nothing was wrong with their cars' battery data.
The news report, which cites customers and unnamed former employees, said that the company created a ""Diversion Team"" in Las Vegas specifically to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.
The team was reportedly created to address a growing problem at Tesla: Its service center growth has not kept pace with the growth in sales for Tesla cars. ""Service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company's advertised estimates,"" the Reuters article said. Messages sent to customers with range-related appointments said ""remote diagnostics"" indicated no battery problems and thus the appointment was canceled.
According to Reuters, Tesla rigged its algorithms for its range meter to give drivers a ""rosy"" idea of how far the car could travel on a full charge; when the battery was half-depleted, the software would show a more realistic range projection, to avoid a driver being stranded with no juice left in the battery.
Customer Alexandre Ponsin told the news agency that he bought a used 2021 Tesla Model 3 with an advertised range of 353 miles, but he found that when it was cold out he got as little as half that range. (Cold weather can reduce range on any car battery.)
Given the chance to refute or explain the range issue to Reuters, both Tesla and Elon Musk failed to respond to repeated requests for comment.
Whether Tesla's range claims violate any marketing laws is unclear. The company is under investigation by the California Department of Motor Vehicles for calling its driver assist software Full Self-Driving, when the car is incapable of driving itself without human assistance. On Wednesday,

: Representatives from Tesla are set to meet with commerce minister Piyush Goyal to discuss a proposal to set up a factory in India for manufacturing its 
cheapest electric vehicle (EV) worth Rs 20 lakh
, reported news agency Reuters.
The proposed EV is expected to be significantly cheaper than Tesla's current lowest-priced offering, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 currently sells for slightly over Rs 26 lakh in China, making the new EV approximately 25 per cent cheaper.
This pricing strategy aligns with Tesla's aggressive discounting of its existing models since the start of the year and CEO Elon Musk's repeated assertions that the company's long-term success hinges on reducing the cost of EVs substantially.

Government not considering any tax waivers for Tesla: Report
While a report from earlier this month indicated that Tesla is planning to manufacture cars with a starting price of Rs 20 lakh, the EV maker has not confirmed any details about the cheaper pricing.
It's worth noting that EVs currently account for less than 2 per cent of total vehicle sales in India, despite the country being the world's third-largest auto market.
This move represents a significant shift in Tesla's approach towards the Indian market. Last year, the company's efforts to reduce import taxes on EVs shipped to India were thwarted by government officials' insistence on local production.
Now, Tesla seems to have embraced the idea of manufacturing locally, marking a sharp reversal in its strategy.
In May, news agency Reuters reported that Tesla executives had visited India and held preliminary talks with officials about setting up a manufacturing base for cars and batteries in the country.
These discussions are set to resume this month, with the focus being on establishing an EV supply chain and discussing land allotment for a factory.
It is also worth noting that the meeting with the commerce minister will be the highest level of dialogue between Tesla and the government since June when Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During this meeting, Musk expressed his intention to make a significant investment in India.

Tesla's plans extend beyond just producing EVs in India. The company has stated that its next-generation vehicle platform will cut production costs by 50 per cent, and multiple models, including an automated ""robotaxi"", could be built from it.
Tesla's plant under construction in Mexico will produce vehicles on this lower-cost, high-volume platform, which the company intends to implement in other factories as well.
Currently, Tesla produces EVs in California and Texas, with additional plants in Berlin and Shanghai. The Shanghai plant is Tesla's largest, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the automaker's global capacity. Plans to expand capacity at this location are pending regulatory approval.

Tesla has plans to build a factory in India to produce its all-new USD 24,000 (Rs 20 lakh) car, reported Reuters.

Representatives from Elon Musk-led Company are set to meet Union Minister for Commerce Piyush Goyal this month.







Tesla has expressed an interest in building a factory in India that would produce low-cost electric vehicles (EVs) for the local market and for export, the person said, adding that the company had indicated that it would be for the new vehicle, reported Reuters.

The discussions represent a sharp reversal for the company after efforts last year to reduce import taxes on EVs shipped to India were scuppered by calls from government officials to commit to making cars locally.

Last month Elon Musk met India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he intended to make a significant investment in the country.

504,Stability and repeatability of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of normal pancreas on 5.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),Zhiyong Jiang,2023-07-24 00:00:00,date,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38360-x,nature.com,To explore the stability and repeatability of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of normal pancreas wi,"Twenty healthy subjects participated in the prospective investigation and underwent MRI scanning of the pancreas between February 2022 and May 2022. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. All volunteers signed the informed consent form. Included if: (1) individuals aged 18–65; (2) no history of drug abuse, drug use one week before the exam, pancreatitis, diabetes, alcohol abuse, chronic liver diseases, hepatic steatosis, or abdominal surgery; (3) no contraindications for MRI (such as implanted pacemaker, metallic implant, and claustrophobia). Exclusion criteria: (1) incomplete DWI procedure due to any reasons, (2) poor image quality (with high motion artifacts) unsuitable for further imaging analysis.

MRI scanning

The 5.0 T whole-body magnetic resonance scanning system (uMR Jupiter, United-Imaging Healthcare, Shanghai, China) was used for all MRI examinations in this study, using a flexible 24-channel body coil and the built-in 24-channel spine coil. Table 1 showed the scanning parameters.

Table 1 MR imaging sequence parameters. Full size table

For regular lFOV DWI scanning, the parameters were field of view (FOV): 300 × 380 mm2; voxel: 2.38 × 2.38 × 4 mm3; repetition time (TR): ~3833 ms; echo time (TE): 49.7 ms; bandwidth (BW): 2300 kHz; slice thickness: 4 mm; number of slices: 16; b values: 0 s/mm2 (average time = 1), and 800 s/mm2 (average time = 5); parallel imaging acceleration factor: 3; and scanning time: ~200 s.

For rFOV DWI scanning, the parameters were FOV: 120 × 240 mm2; voxel: 1.50 × 1.50 × 4 mm3; TR: 3555 ms; TE: 49.7 ms; BW: 2300 kHz; slice thickness: 4 mm; number of slices: 16; b values: 0 s/mm2 (average time = 1), and 800 s/mm2 (average time = 5); parallel imaging acceleration factor: 3; and scanning time: 125 s.

All subjects were fasted for at least 6 hours before the MRI examination. Each subject underwent two sessions of MRI scanning, after the first scanning session was completed, the second scanning session was performed after an interval of about 48 hours, and the sequence parameters and positioning for scanning were the same as the first session. For each scanning session, after shimming, each subject first underwent lFOV T2 scanning, and then lFOV DWI scanning, afterward, rFOV DWI scanning was performed and got the images (Fig. 1). The respiration-triggered scanning method (end-expiration triggering) was used.

Data analysis

The MRI images of all participants were analyzed by the same two radiologists with 12 and 15 years of experience, respectively. The distribution of SNR and ADC values of manually selected regions of interest (ROIs) were examined. ROIs were selected from pancreatic head (from the margin of the right to the left superior mesenteric vein), pancreatic body (pancreas region from the left margin of the superior mesenteric vein to the left aorta), and tail (pancreas region from the left margin of the aorta to the hilus lienis). The pancreatic ducts, cystic lesions, or artifacts were avoided when choosing the ROIs. ROI was placed at least 6 mm from the pancreas margin to avoid the average volume effect.

For objectively assessing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ADC variability, the two radiologists delineated the ROIs of the pancreatic head, body, and tail on DWI images independently. One radiologist (observer 1) delineated the ROIs and re-measured the SNR and ADC on DWI images again after a 4-week interval. rFOV images do not include any areas outside of the body; therefore, air cannot be utilized in the calculation of SNR. SNR was calculated as the ratio between the average signal intensity and the standard deviation of the signal intensity manually placed circular ROIs. The average ADC value was acquired from the oval/round ROI on ADC images. The areas of ROI ranged from 50 to 100 mm2. The average ADC values of the pancreatic head, body, and tail were calculated as the overall ADC value of the pancreas.

The semi-quantitative grading system was used to evaluate image quality and artifact grade. The presence of artifacts was first assessed, and then two radiologists independently assessed the lFOV and rFOV DWI images using the 5-level criteria (5, no artifacts; 4, low amounts of artifacts not influencing the quality of diagnosis; 3, with artifacts that could reduce the quality of diagnosis; 2, with artifacts leading to the minimal information of diagnosis; and 1, could not be used for diagnosis). A subjective assessment of overall image quality was also performed (5, the best image quality; 4, high image quality for diagnosis; 3, images with limited diagnostic value/quality; 2, images provide only very limited information for diagnosis; and 1, could not be used for diagnosis).

Statistical analysis

SPSS 26.0 was used for statistical analysis. The Shapiro–Wilk test was performed for the normality test. Continuous data with a normal distribution were described as means ± standard deviations and analyzed using the independent sample t-test. The paired t-test was used for the comparisons between the two measurements of ADC and SNR from the same investigator. Normality and Lognormality Tests are used to analyze the ADC value between rFOV and lFOV. Intra- and inter-observer variability and test–retest repeatability (the reprocucibility of two scanning sessions) of ADC measurements for each anatomical region of the pancreas and whole pancreas were analyzed by the Bland–Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The Bland–Altman test and weighted κ coefficient was used to analyze the consistency of ADC between lFOV and rFOV. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Ethics approval

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the institutional review board of Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University (No.2021095, December 2021). The subjects in the study provided written informed consent.","© 2023 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

SHANGHAI, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory delivered 64,285 electric vehicles in July, up 128 percent from the same period last year, according to the U.S. electric auto giant.


The factory's cumulative deliveries over the first seven months of this year exceeded 540,000 units, surpassing the number of deliveries made throughout 2021.


Recently, the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory began exporting its Model Y (Rear-Wheel Drive) vehicle to the Republic of Korea (ROK), marking the first entry of made-in-China Tesla vehicles into the ROK market.


The company noted that the localization rate of car components used in the factory has exceeded 95 percent.

The level of buyer interest in EVs means BMW is ""investing more than originally planned in the global ramp-up of e-mobility,' Chief Financial Officer Walter Mertl said Thursday, adding that investments in batteries for the current and next generation of EVs are ""massive.'

During the second quarter, development spending jumped by nearly a fifth to €1.84 billion ($2 billion).

Battery-powered car sales made up about 13% of group deliveries during the first half led by demand for models like the i4 sedan and iX3 SUV. Next year, the proportion of EV deliveries is set to rise to at least one-fifth, BMW said.

Incumbent carmakers are battling to catch up to Tesla Inc., which is pulling away in the global EV sales race following aggressive price cuts. In China, the most important market for Germany's Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, local manufacturers like BYD Co. are increasingly dominating in EV sales.

BMW kept global prices stable for its pure-electric models, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said in a call with reporters, adding that the company is currently ""rather content' with its EV pricing in China.

All of BMW's EV variants are turning in a profit, which will increase as the carmaker has now started to offer pure-electric variants in its higher 7-series and 5-series segment, Mertl said.

BMW also increased its car sales forecast for 2023 to now expect solid gains with the new 5-Series sedan and its electric sibling, the i5, which is set to help boost volumes during the second half of the year. The shares fell as much as 3.1% in Frankfurt trading.

While demand for its luxury cars remains strong, BMW warned Tuesday that increased costs for parts are reducing its cash flow while also citing logistics issues as a constraint. The company will incur higher costs from increased inventories to ensure meeting customer demand, Mertl said Thursday in speech notes.

Several carmakers face new logistics constraints after a shortage of semiconductors eased, allowing them to produce more vehicles. Volkswagen AG lowered its delivery outlook last week as shortages of trains and truck drivers left finished vehicles stranded at factories. Porsche AG had to restrict sales of its electric Taycan after grappling with sourcing certain components.

BMW group earnings before interest and tax increased 28% to €4.34 billion compared to the second quarter of last year, beating average analyst estimates of a €4.23 billion result. Automotive returns rose to 9.2%.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/03/TP_e6d8bimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.128369,6eefedbc985fcb75725e522bee9af1fe

U.S. auto safety regulators have opened another investigation into safety problems with Tesla vehicles




The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into a dozen complaints about loss of steering control or loss of power steering in the 2023 Models 3 and Y electric vehicles




The probe covers an estimated 280,000 vehicles. Five drivers alleged in complaints they couldn't steer the vehicles at all. Seven more cited a loss of power steering assist

This time the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into 
a dozen complaints about loss of steering control or loss of power steering
 in the 2023 Models 3 and Y electric vehicles.


The probe covers an estimated 280,000 vehicles. Five drivers alleged in complaints they couldn't steer the vehicles at all. Seven more cited a loss of power steering that required increased steering effort.


There was one report of a crash but no complaints of any injuries.


The agency says in a document posted Tuesday on its website that loss of steering control can be accompanied by messages to drivers indicating that the power steering assist has been reduced or disabled.


The document says investigators will look into how often the problem happens, manufacturing processes and the severity of the problem.


The probe is at least the sixth started by the agency into Tesla vehicles in the past three years. Investigators are looking into Teslas that can crash into parked emergency vehicles while running on the Autopilot partially automated driving system, emergency braking for no reason, suspension failures, steering wheels that can fall off, and front seat belts that may not be connected properly.

508,Tesla Proves That It Is Just A Low-Margin Car Company Shortseller,MENAFN,2023-08-01 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106763233/Tesla-Proves-That-It-Is-Just-A-Low-Margin-Car-Company-Shortseller,menafn.com,get access to the world's leading hedge fund shareholder letters and learn what opportunities they're looking at to maximize their 2023 returns. <,"Stanphyl Capital's commentary for the month ended July 31, 2023, discussing their short position in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In July Tesla reported Q2 earnings that proved once again it's now just a low-margin car company forced to continually slash prices to maintain delivery volume, and on the conference call Musk insinuated that the price-slashing will continue. Rather than discuss the report here with my usual verbiage, I shall instead post a few of my Tweets from the night it was released:

And one from Jim Chanos:

Yes, please don't lecture me about Tesla's'energy business,' which in Q2 accounted for just 6% of revenue (declining from 6.5% in Q1) and likely has a net margin in the mid-single digits as it's in an extremely competitive, low-margin industry.

As mentioned at the beginning of this letter, in July Reuters revealed a massive & systemic elon musk-directed tesla consumer fraud regarding the range of its cars, while in May Handelsblatt did the same for a massive & systemic tesla safety cover-up (while people are now dying in or because of Teslas at an astounding pace ). I believe one or both of these egregious deceptions will finally force Musk from the company and regulators to crack down hard, as well as destroy whatever remains of Tesla's rapidly diminishing consumer goodwill.

Also, Tesla recently announced that it will open its U.S. charging stations to cars from multiple other manufacturers which, in turn, will adopt Tesla's connector and charging protocol. (Those competitors are building their own network, too.)

Seeing as many people only buy a Tesla instead of a competing EV in order to access those chargers, and seeing as all the competing charging networks will also adopt this protocol while paying Tesla nothing (Tesla open-sourced it), this will cost Tesla far more in lost auto sale profits than the pennies per share it may gain from charging profits. Thus, any increase in Tesla's stock price that can be attributed to this is as ridiculous as the increase attributed to its'AI' that regularly sends Teslas crashing into other vehicles, people, trees and buildings.

Tesla has objectively lost its'product edge,' with many competing cars now offering comparable or better real-world range , better interiors, similar or faster charging speeds and much better quality. Tesla ranks near the bottom of both consumer reports' reliability survey and the 2023 jd power survey :

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? click here to find out .

In fact, Tesla is likely now the second, third or fourth choice for many EV buyers, and only maintains its volume lead though a short-lived edge in production capacity that will disappear over the next 12 to 36 months as competitors rapidly increase the ability to produce their superior EVs.

Tesla's poorly-built model y faces competition from the much better made (and often just better) electric hyundai ioniq 5 , kia ev6 , ford mustang mach e , cadillac lyriq , nissan ariya , audi q4 e-tron , bmw ix3 , mercedes eqb , chevrolet blazer ev & equinox ev , volvo xc-40 recharge and polestar 3 . And Tesla's Model 3 now has terrific direct'sedan competition' from Volvo's beautiful polestar 2 , bmw's i4 , hyundai's ioniq 6 and volkswagen's id.7 , as well as multiple local competitors in China.

And in the high-end electric car segment worldwide the porsche taycan outsells the Model S, while the spectacular new bmw i7 , mercedes eqs and eqe , audi e-tron gt and lucid air make the Tesla look like a fast Yugo, while the extremely well reviewed new bmw ix , mercedes eqs suv and audi q8 etron (as well as multiple new Chinese models) do the same to the Model X.

And oh, the joke of a'pickup truck' Tesla first previewed in 2019 (and still hasn't shown in production-ready form) won't be much of'growth engine' either, as by the time it's in meaningful mass-production in 2024 that grotesque-looking kluge will enter a dogfight of a market vs. ford's f-150 lightning , gm's electric silverado , the dodge ram rev and rivian's r1t .

Indeed, for years I've said'tesla is blackberry'-the maker of a first-generation version of a product that-once the market was proven-would be supplanted into niche obscurity by newer, better versions, and now it's finally happening.

I believe Musk knows this (hence his recent'Twitter buying distraction'), with VW Group, Hyundai/Kia, Ford, GM, Stellantis, BMW, Mercedes, BYD & other Chinese competitors and, in a few years, Toyota, Nissan & Honda, stealing Tesla's share and pounding its stock price into the low double-digits, where it will be valued as'just another car company.'

Meanwhile, the NHTSA has initiated the first of what will likely be multiple recalls of Tesla's fraudulently named'Full Self Driving' (even before the aforementioned safety cover-up revealed by Handelsblatt), and in January it was revealed that elon musk personally directed its fake, fraudulent promotional video (something extremely similar to what Theranos did with its blood machines and nikola with its truck ), and that the doj is investigating him for it and so is the sec .

The refund liability potential for Tesla for this is in the billions of dollars, and possibly even the tens of billions if a class action lawsuit proves that the cars involved were purchased solely due to the (fallacious) promise of'full self-driving.'

And, of course, there will be a massive'valuation reappraisal' for Tesla's stock as the world wakes up to the fact that its so-called'autonomy technology' is deadly, trailing-edge garbage that consumer reports now ranks just seventh vs. competitors' systems (behind Ford, GM, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota and Volkswagen) and guidehouse insights now rates dead last :

Yet Tesla has sold this trashy software for over six years now...

...and still promotes it on its website via the aforementioned completely fraudulent video ! (For all Tesla-related deaths cited in the media-which is likely only a small fraction of those that have occurred-please see this spreadsheet .)

Another favorite Tesla hype story has been built around so-called'proprietary battery technology.' In fact though, Tesla has nothing proprietary there-it doesn't make them, it buys them from panasonic , catl and lg , and it's the biggest liar in the industry regarding the real-world range of its cars. And if new-format 4680 cells enter the market, even if Tesla makes some of its own,

other manufacturers will gladly sell them to anyone , and BMW has already announced it will buy them from CATL and EVE.

The office space has a starting monthly rent of Rs 11.65 lakh,"By India Today Business Desk
: Months after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Elon Musk in the US, Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited leased office space in the Panchshil Business Park of Maharashtra's Pune.
This is seen as a major step towards the entry of EV giant Tesla into the Indian market.
Earlier, senior officials from Tesla also held a meeting with their counterparts of Invest India officials to devise a plan for setting up a manufacturing plant for electric vehicles in India.
According to data analytics company CRE Matrix, Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited has acquired office space covering an area of 5,850 square feet on the first floor of B wing in an under-construction building named Panchshil Business Park.
Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited has also entered into a five-year lease agreement with Tablespace Technologies Pvt Ltd, with a monthly rent of Rs 11.65 lakh and a security deposit of Rs 34.95 lakh for a five-year-period, CRE Matrix said.
The agreement also includes five car parks and 10 bike parks.
According to CRE Matrix, the lease deal includes a lock-in period of 36 months, with a 5 per cent per annum escalation clause. The rental payments will start from October 1, 2023.
With a development size of nearly 11 lakh square feet, Panchshil Business Park is well connected with major areas of Pune, including the airport.
Earlier in 2021, Tesla India Motor & Energy Pvt Ltd was registered as an Indian subsidiary of Tesla in Bengaluru.

They will provide critical and social infrastructure wit,"That's according to the press service of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, Ukrinform reports.

""Tesla Powerwall is another effective solution in the context of Russia's energy terror. They will help provide backup electricity where it is most needed. Therefore, even in the face of a blackout, critical infrastructure will continue to operate, doctors will be able to save lives, teachers will be able to teach classes, and Ukrainians will be able to stay in touch with their families,"" Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov

said.

Powerwall systems work on the principle of a power bank: they are charged by electricity and hold a charge for 12-14 hours. They can work together with solar panels and be charged by the sun.

As reported, Ukraine already has experience in using Tesla Powerwall. More than a year ago, about 50 such systems were received from partners. The systems are used in hospitals and outpatient clinics in the de-occupied territories and help to maintain Internet and communication in the frontline cities of Donetsk and Mykolaiv regions.

Here's some of their best, and worst, comments.","A

A 
Bloomberg survey
 of more than 5,000 Tesla Model 3 owners found many respondents had become disenchanted with the EV maker's owner Elon Musk in the four years since the outlet's last survey.
 
Many reported deep concerns about 
Musk's online presence
 and some of his controversial opinions. 
 
Nevertheless, the owners were overall still very positive about the Model 3 and said they planned to stick with Tesla.
 
Nearly 87% of the Model 3 owners surveyed said they were considering another Tesla for their next vehicle, while 96% said they were considering an EV of some sort.
 
But some still found issues with their vehicles, and many shared safety worries over Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology. 
 
Here's some of the best and worst things customers told Bloomberg about their Model 3 – and the FSD technology.
 
The good
 
""Best car I've ever owned.""
 
""The one 
repair
 I needed was for the charge door and they came to my house to fix it in one day, not under 
warranty
. A great experience.""
 
""I love my car, and intend on getting my wife a Tesla when she moves to USA. Safest cars on the road are Teslas.""
 
""Makes it almost impossible to consider buying any other vehicle, especially electric.""
 
""Performance & mechanical reliability amazingly better than any non-EV. There just isn't any comparison.""
 
 
 
 The Model 3's interior. 
Tesla
 
 
 
The bad
 
""Numerous problems with reliability follow a pattern. First, Tesla claims it doesn't exist, then they damage the car trying to fix it. Window actuators failed multiple times. Each time claimed no problem. Then, when they looked at, once they damaged the door trying to slam it while window stayed open, second time, cut the interior while trying to replace actuator. Both times, they needed to keep for 10 days to fix their own fubar.""
 
""The wheel well rusts and Tesla claims it is normal. This is the first time I've seen a wheel well rust from the 5 or so cars I have owned in the past.""
 
""I've been unable to use USB storage and charging for years, HVAC system doesn't work properly above 32 F, rear inverter blew while parked, some trim pieces fell off""
 
""Car has been unable to drive for 3 months. AC system has not worked for over a year. Very dissatisfied.""
 
""Worst car I've ever owned. Appears to have been assembled by a 6 year old. Drunk. With a hand tied behind his back. Garbage.""
 
Autopilot and FSD
 
""I definitely feel safer driving with it. It isn't perfect, but neither am I, and we complement each other's weaknesses. It has faster reaction times and sees better (360 degrees).""
 
""People's risk profiles understandably differ, but if auto pilot is used properly and expectations are realistic, it's outstanding and much safer.""
 
""It is dangerous and this man must be stopped.""
 
""This $10,000 option was clearly fraud and should be treated as such by regulators.""
 
""
Phantom
 braking is a frightening experience that greatly lowers confidence in FSD. I simply don't trust it and would like a refund.""
 
""My wife describes Autopilot and FSD in the following way, 'Your car drives like a drunk old man.'""
 
""FSD is nowhere near safe enough to be used on public roads without 100% driver attention. Given that drivers rely on the hype and not reality, I think this is likely to create unsafe situations for everyone sharing the road.""

A government agency wants to know about it.

As reported by CNBC, Tesla is now under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States over reports of steering issues with the Model 3 and Model Y. According to the notice posted to the NHTSA website, the issue caused owners to lose control of steering while driving.

While some reported the loss of power steering, some said the steering would lock in place and that the car would only go forwards and backward — but never turn.

The federal vehicle safety regulator said in a notice posted to the agency's website that it has received a dozen complaints from drivers who experienced steering problems in their Teslas, including one who said it had caused a crash. The probe, which the NHTSA called a 'preliminary evaluation,' could affect up to an estimated 280,000 vehicles in the U.S.

This isn't the only investigation that Tesla is facing right now into its vehicles. Earlier this year, the company also ended up under investigation over reports that the steering wheel was 'falling off' the Model Y. In at least one report involving that investigation, an owner experienced the steering wheel partially disconnecting from the steering column.

The company is also still undergoing a recall of its Full Self-Driving Beta due to issues with the software causing 'traveling or turning through certain intersections during a stale yellow traffic light' and other issues. Tesla actually paused installations of the FSD Beta while it fixed the issue, so anyone who hadn't installed it yet would not get access to it.

Despite all that, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y continue to reign supreme as the most popular electric vehicles in many markets and, in some cases, the most popular car in the world.",bgr.com,2125,news,US,en,"Andy Meek,Chris Hachey,Chris Smith,Jacob Siegal,Joe Wituschek,Joshua Hawkins",https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tesla-model-y.jpg?quality=82&strip=all,False,@heyimjoew,7.501715,76d1dbe79f581198046bbb489264d6de

The ABC15 Investigators found dozens of drivers have filed complaints with federal auto safety regulators who are urging car owners to learn how to manually get out in an emergency.


'It's definitely a safety concern; it was one of the hotter days,' said 73-year-old Rick Meggison.


He said he was stuck in his Tesla Model Y in his garage back in June.


'I couldn't open the doors. I couldn't lower the windows. The computer was dead, so I couldn't open the glove box. I couldn't open anything.' Meggison said his main lithium-ion battery, what's needed to propel his electric car, had plenty of range.

This time the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into 
a dozen complaints about loss of steering control or loss of power steering
 in the 2023 Models 3 and Y electric vehicles.
 
The probe covers an estimated 280,000 vehicles. Five drivers alleged in complaints they couldn't steer the vehicles at all. Seven more cited a loss of power steering that required increased steering effort.
 
There was one report of a crash but no complaints of any injuries.
 
The agency says in a document posted Tuesday on its website that loss of steering control can be accompanied by messages to drivers indicating that the power steering assist has been reduced or disabled. 
 
The document says investigators will look into how often the problem happens, manufacturing processes and the severity of the problem. 
 
The probe is at least the fifth started by the agency into Tesla vehicles in the past three years. Investigators are looking into Teslas that can crash into parked emergency vehicles while running on the Autopilot partially automated driving system, suspension failures, steering wheels that can fall off, and front seat belts that may not be connected properly.
 
A message was left early Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.

Associated Press
 
 
 
Where Tesla sits right now reminds Ford CEO Jim Farley a lot of the early days of his own auto company. 
 
Tesla has obviously found success — but this moment in particular could be difficult for the EV market leader given the 
ongoing price war
 it started, Farley said on an episode of the 
Fully Charged podcast published in June.
 
""I think this is really one of Tesla's most challenging moments,"" Farley told host Robert Llewellyn. ""They got through Model 3 and Model Y commercialization in the plant and scaling production. The next big test turns out to be their heavy discounting to stimulate demand, which is a sugar high, and it continues to deteriorate the elasticity.""
 
Tesla has been 
hitting record production and delivery numbers
 in recent quarters, but the company is also staring down 
shrinking market share
 and 
falling profit margin
.
 
""Less and less people are signing up as you cut the price. This is what Henry Ford found out with the Model T — that you commoditize your product when you're telling people, Hey, the price is what really matters,"" Farley added.
 
""I think we're basically where we were with Model T,"" he added. ""Henry Ford was only a year away from going bankrupt.""
 
Ford and 
Tesla
 have been both friends and rivals over the past few years as Ford races to electrify and snatch up some of Tesla's market share. The executives have tried to 
one-up each other with the price cuts
, but also have found common ground in 
teaming up on Tesla's charging tech
. 
 
Farley put some distance between his company and Tesla by pointing to his plans to electrify 
commercial vehicles
, larger, three-row 
crossovers
, 
pickup trucks
, and high-performance vehicles.
 
""We don't want to make commodity products,"" Farley said. ""We want to participate in the part of the market where Ford knows the customer really well and we can innovate on their behalf for things that they don't know they need.""
 
At the same time, the auto executive admitted Tesla remains his biggest all-electric competition — in addition to the 
major Chinese auto players
. 
 
 
 
 Farley said he sees the Chinese automakers as major competitors, not 
GM
 or Volkswagen. 
BYD
 
 
 
""This should be no surprise to anyone. We've been watching this for years now play out. I've always said that our main competition in the pure electric space is going to be BYD and Geely and Tesla,"" Farley said. ""It's not 
General
 Motors. It's not going to be BMW or Volkswagen.""
 
Farley also emphasized the need for vertical integration in the age of electrification — yet another way many 
automakers are having to mimic Tesla
 — as well as 
reducing the industry's dependence on China's battery supply chain
.
 
""We now pretty much vertically integrate all the raw material purchases. We're going to the mine and buying the raw materials and then arranging for the processing — all the way to our 
battery
 plants, that's all new,"" Farley said. ""When people buy that 
electric car
, they probably have no idea how much of a shift it is.""
 
The goal is to ultimately produce 
more affordable EVs
.
 
""We don't want to just make another generic, affordable EV, because I think there's going to be plenty of those,"" Farley said. ""It's an open playing field.""

518,Federal regulators are investigating fatal crash involving Tesla,Susan Carpenter,2023-08-10 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transportation/2023/08/10/federal-regulators-are-investigating-fatal-crash-involving-tesla-autopilot,ny1.com,It's the 35th such crash NHTSA is investigating,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating a fatal crash in Virginia that may have involved Tesla's Autopilot system. The 57-year-old died in July when the car he was driving hit a heavy truck.
 
According to a statement from the Sheriff's office for Fauquier County, Virginia, where July's fatal crash took place, the Tesla ran under the side of a tractor trailer after the truck's driver tried to turn onto a highway. The truck driver was cited for reckless driving.


Last month's crash is the latest in a string of such incidents NHTSA is investigating that involve Tesla's semi-automated driving system. The agency said at least 17 people have died.


Tesla has been offering its Autopilot technology since 2015 for customers who pay a premium to activate it on their vehicles. The technology is 'designed to assist you with the most burdensome parts of driving,' Tesla says on its web site. 'Autopilot enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane.'


Despite its name, Autopilot cannot drive a car completely by itself. According to Tesla's web site, 'current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.'


NHTSA's newest investigation into Tesla's driver-assistance system followed another special crash investigation the agency opened last month following a fatal crash in California on July 5. That crash took place in South Lake Tahoe and involved a 2018 Tesla Model 3 that collided head on with a 2013 Subaru Impreza, killing its 17-year-old driver and a three-month-old passenger in the Tesla.",mynews13.com,5219,economics,US,en,Susan Carpenter,https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Tesla_Recall_AP_0720,False,,8.442317,e510715a485bb5f168b93a32430dc5e3

Auto executives still don't think the Tesla sales model will catch on — despite some pretty substantial shifts in the auto retail space already taking place.
 
More than one-third of executives in the car business don't believe an agency model (or direct-to-consumer sales like Tesla does) will find its way to U.S. 
car buying
, according to a 
Kerrigan Advisors study released earlier this week
. About 43% were unsure about the new way of doing things materializing, and only 22% were optimistic it could happen. The dealer consultancy surveyed more than 115 car company executives between December 2022 and May 2023
 
Tesla has 
always operated with a direct-to-consumer model
, eliminating the need for a middleman — in this business, dealers — and allowing customers to buy vehicles directly from its site with no room for haggling on the price. Buyers can pick up their Teslas at a Tesla showroom (notably not a formal 
dealership
), but transactions aren't typically done there. 
Other EV startups have followed suit
.
 
Meanwhile, 
traditional automakers have primarily leaned on dealers
 to work with car buyers, serve as a negotiator over 
price and terms
, and be a stable source for vehicle service. This also helps companies mark a car as ""delivered"" and collect payment as soon as it hits a dealer lot but potentially before it's in a customer's hands. 
 
Some car companies have hinted at experimenting more with an agency model, limiting the role of dealers and giving consumers what they say is a more straightforward buying experience, especially with more uptake of 
electric vehicles
.
 
BMW's CFO, for example, told Reuters last fall
 the company wants to give customers a direct ordering option.
 
During the company's late-July earnings call, 
Ford CEO Jim Farley
 said 
Ford's
 EV business (coined Model e) has already moved to ""a differentiated model that will deliver non-negotiated price, a simple shopping and ownership experience and remote services."" 
 
Automaker demands put some dealers on the chopping block
 
But it's been a huge debate in the industry as 
auto dealers
 are a strong lobbying force, so much so that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis 
banned direct-to-consumer car sales in the state
, with the exception of Tesla and EV startups that never had franchised dealers. As is, 
EV startups have had to battle franchise laws in each state
 in which they want to set up shop.
 
As automakers spend billions of dollars to electrify in the coming years — and 
lose billions while adoption is still ramping up
 — they're asking dealers to make substantial investments in their stores. Kerrigan experts have suggested 
this might be one way auto manufacturers are attempting to push out
 their dealerships amid the EV transition. 
 
Yet, these auto companies also want their dealers around in some capacity to service all the EVs they're hoping to get on the roads in the coming years.
 
Auto retail has to change, but to what extent
 
That's all to say that car-buying just isn't what it used to be
, and the 
modern car-shopping experience
 has shifted quite a bit. It's also clear that 
EVs are changing the auto dealership as we know it
, and 
Tesla is, in fact, influencing the industry to transform
.
 
But auto retail tech firm 
CDK Global found that while 46% of dealers felt unprepared to handle a shift to direct-to-consumer this year
 (up from 19% feeling unprepared in 2022), only 10% are actually concerned automakers will attempt to make the switch (fewer than the 12% that were concerned last year). 
 
Many customers are interested in the ""Teslafied"" way of doing things
, but others will always need a brick-and-mortar store.
 
""There are ways to get consumers the feeling of more buying online and the direct-to-consumer type of experience"" without full commitment to the agency model, Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, said. But, ""It does feel like the balance hasn't quite been found yet.""
 
Meanwhile, the percent of car-buyers who order their vehicles entirely online still remains very low, according to CDK. 
 
""Because of the supply problems that have happened for three or so years, people got really used to ordering from a factory and ordering in-transit — but they did it at the dealership,"" Dave Thomas, CDK director of content marketing, told Insider.
 
EVs were ""going to be the catalyst to jumpstart an agency-type environment,"" he added, but the need for in-person EV education has kept buyers coming back in-person, at least for now.

Tesla has established a data center in China for localized data storage, and all data generated from its vehicles sold in the Chinese mainland market will be stored within China, the electric carmaker said in a post on its official Weibo account on Monday.
 
Tesla released the post in response to the recent online discussions about its vehicles' ""sentry mode"". The mode uses the vehicle's external cameras in addition to vehicle sensors to detect a security event while parked, according to Tesla's website.
 
An airport in Yueyang, Hunan province, imposed a ban on Tesla vehicles accessing public parking zones due to apprehension about potential security vulnerabilities linked to Tesla's sentry mode.
 
The ban was based on concerns that Tesla cars record the vehicle's surroundings once the driver has left.
 
A service worker at the airport said that the ban applied to everyone, including airport employees, and that ""many places have a similar rule"".
 
Tesla said in the post that sentry mode, called ""guard mode"" by some other automakers, is an intelligent security feature that is a standard configuration in mainstream smart vehicles and is not exclusive to Tesla. When Tesla vehicles leave the factory, this feature is turned off by default and requires the owner to manually activate it.
 
Once sentry mode is activated and the vehicle is locked and in ""park mode"", the system will send an alert to the owner and record suspicious activities around the vehicle if any potential threats such as damage or vehicle theft are detected.
 
The post also mentioned that unlike some vehicles that can remotely view their surroundings through such a mode, the data from Tesla vehicles is only stored offline on the in-car USB device. Neither the owner nor Tesla can access this data remotely.
 
It also reiterated its commitment to regulatory compliance and data privacy, stating that since the collaborative release of the trial version of the Regulations on the Management of Automotive Data Security in October 2021, Tesla has actively engaged in regulatory compliance pilot programs in partnership with relevant government agencies.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202308/15/64dad748a310352610bab86d.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,9.319916,9e1da329d7e54ddfc0e93b2d3bfaa25e

Tesla cars are banned from parking at Yueyang Sanhe Airport in Yueyang, Hunan province, due to confidentiality concerns, airport officials said on Sunday.
 
A video circulating online showed a ""No Tesla"" sign at the entrance of the airport's parking lot. A service worker at the airport confirmed to Jiupai News in Hubei province that the rule has been in effect for months.
 
The reason for the ban is that Tesla cars have a mode that records the car's surroundings once the driver has left. The service worker said that the rule applied to everyone, including airport employees, and that ""many places have a similar rule.""

General Motors Co. (
GM
)


General Motors has not been shy about its plan to overtake Tesla as the top U.S. EV seller by the mid-2020s. GM has announced $35 billion in planned EV investments through 2025. While many EV startups are unprofitable and trade at steep valuations, GM reported $2.6 billion in net income in the second quarter and trades at just 4.8 times forward earnings. Murphy says GM's strong legacy business is helping the company ramp up its investments in EV and 
autonomous vehicle
 technology. Bank of America has a 'buy' rating and $75 price target for GM stock, which closed at $33.89 on Aug. 11. 


Toyota Motor Corp. (
TM
)


Japan's Toyota Motor is one of the world's largest automakers. The company plans to produce about 3.5 million EVs per year by 2030.

Murphy says Ford's EV division losses have been steeper than expected, but the company is making progress in transitioning to next-generation technology.

Despite the company's knowledge'that there's cross traffic or potential for cross traffic, the Autopilot at the time was not designed to detect that,' according to the testimony given in 2021 by company engineer Chris Payne that was excerpted in a recent court filing.

Engineer Nicklas Gustafsson provided a similar account in a 2021 deposition.

'The electric-car maker didn't make any changes to its driver-assistance technology to account for crossing traffic in the nearly three years between two high-profile accidents that killed Tesla drivers whose cars slammed into the side of trucks,' the report mentioned, citing newly-revealed testimony.

The family for one of the dead Tesla owners is now seeking punitive damages in a lawsuit, set to go to trial this October.

Tesla is under intense scrutiny for its Autopilot and its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance features.

In some relief for Tesla CEO Musk, jurors in an Autopilot-related 2019 crash in the US gave the verdict in favour of the electric car company in April this year.

The jury in the California state court awarded plaintiff Justine Hsu, who sued Tesla in 2020, no damages, according to reports.

In February, Tesla received a clean chit from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S Autopilot system in 2021.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also investigating self-driving claims made by Musk.

In February, Tesla paused the rollout of its Full Self-Driving beta software in the US and Canada following a recall of the system.

Tesla
's operations are seemingly ever-expanding – first Austin with the 
Gigafactory
, then Bastrop with the 
Boring Company
, and now Kyle.
 
As part of its planned $770 million expansion announced earlier this year, Tesla will lease three of five warehouses in a new 
1.4-million-square-foot industrial park
 in Kyle called 35 Logistics, Kyle Mayor 
Travis Mitchell
 announced in his state of the city address today. (The entire development is about 20% bigger than the Domain, for reference.) Tesla is the first tenant and will occupy most of the park, which is one of the first projects over a million square feet between Austin and San Antonio – a corridor that will only continue to boom with development.
 
It's unclear what the new facilities will be used for – Mitchell referred to Tesla's intentions as 'a little cloak and dagger' – but presumably it will have something to do with the Gigafactory in eastern Travis County. The Gigafactory's suppliers are fueling rapid expansion in the region: 
Simwon NA Corp.
, an auto body manufacturer, has a factory in Kyle, as does plastic parts manufacturer 
Plastikon Industries Inc.
, and electric vehicle supplier 
HBPO
 recently opened a facility in Manor. In another clue as to what the site will be used for, Tesla told regulators in January that the $770 million expansion will include a battery cell testing site and cathode and drive unit manufacturing site.
 
Like Travis County with the Gigafactory, both the city of Kyle and Hays County have provided property tax abatements up to 75% for 10 years – Kyle up to $4.9 million, and Hays County with $3.4 million, the 
Austin Business Journal reported
. We don't know how many people will be employed at the new facility.

On Saturday, the auto-maker released the new version of the Tesla app, 4.24.0, with a note mentioning, ""Access your vehicle controls and climate from the Apple Shortcuts app.""

To use Siri with Shortcuts, users have to invoke the iPhone maker's digital assistant and say the name of their automation.

""It's a little clunkier than actual Siri integration, because to trigger Shortcuts automations, you have to memorise the names you've given them and repeat them verbatim, but it's probably the best Tesla owners will get, at least for now,"" the report said.

The release notes by the company slightly undersold the Shortcuts support.

With the new Shortcuts support, users will likely be able to use Shortcuts to control several modes such as Dog Mode or Bioweapon Defense Mode.

Just by using their voice, users will also be able to close all the windows, adjust media volume, open their frunk, or set a charge limit.

Meanwhile, last month, the auto-maker had started a new email campaign to urge Tesla owners with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package to upgrade to a new car and transfer the FSD package.

The transfer terms and the email campaign had revealed that what Musk called an ""offer of amnesty"" is nothing more than Tesla triggering a demand surge.

Important Risk Disclosure
 
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or click here. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.
 
PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information)
 
You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program. The investment program of the Fund is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
 
GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. 
Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. 
The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock's performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock's performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.
 
Underlying Stock Risk: 
The Underlying Stock is subject to many risks that can negatively impact its revenue and viability including, but are not limited to price volatility risk, management risk, inflation risk, global economic risk, growth risk, supply and demand risk, operations risk, regulatory risk, environmental risk, terrorism risk and the risk of natural disasters. The Underlying Stock objectives may be affected by its ability to develop and launch new products, the growth of its sales and delivery capabilities, part supplier constraints or delays, consumer demand for electric vehicles and competition from existing and competitors. The Fund's daily returns may be affected by many factors but will depend on the performance and volatility of the Underlying Stock.
 
Derivatives Risk
: The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These risks include (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. Such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets, including, but not limited to: changing supply and demand relationships; government programs and policies; national and international political and economic events, changes in interest rates, inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships. Trading derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities.
 
For Long Funds: Leverage Risk
: The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Stock will be magnified. This means that an investment in the Fund will be reduced by an amount equal to 1.25% for every 1% daily decline in the Underlying Stock, not including the costs of financing leverage and other operating expenses, which would further reduce its value. The Fund could theoretically lose an amount greater than its net assets in the event the Underlying Stock declines more than 80%. Leverage will also have the effect of magnifying any differences in the Fund performance's correlation with the Underlying Stock
 
For Short Funds: Short Sale Risk: 
The Fund will seek inverse or 'short' exposure through financial instruments, which would cause the Fund to be exposed to certain risks associated with selling short. These risks include, under certain market conditions, an increase in the volatility and decrease in the liquidity of the instruments underlying the short position, which may lower the Fund's return, result in a loss, have the effect of limiting the Fund's ability to obtain inverse exposure through financial instruments, or require the Fund to seek inverse exposure through alternative investment strategies that may be less desirable or more costly to implement. To the extent that, at any particular point in time, the instruments underlying the short position may be thinly traded or have a limited market, including due to regulatory action, the Fund may be unable to meet its investment objective due to a lack of available securities or counterparties. During such periods, the Fund's ability to issue additional Creation Units may be adversely affected. Obtaining inverse exposure through these instruments may be considered an aggressive investment technique. Any income, dividends or payments by any assets underlying the Fund's short positions, if any, would negatively impact the Fund. The Fund could theoretically lose an amount greater than its net assets in the event the Underlying Stock increases more than 100%.
 
For Long Funds: Compounding Risk
: The Fund aims to replicate the leveraged daily returns of the Underlying Stock and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Underlying Stock's performance, before fees and expenses. Compounding affects all investments but has a more significant impact on funds that aims to replicate leverage daily returns. For a Fund aiming to replicate 1.25 times the daily performance of an Underlying Stock, if adverse daily performance of the Underlying Stock reduces the amount of a shareholder's investment, any further adverse daily performance will lead to a smaller dollar loss because the shareholder's investment had already been reduced by the prior adverse performance. Equally, however, if favorable daily performance of the Underlying Stock increases the amount of a shareholder's investment, the dollar amount lost due to future adverse performance will increase because the shareholder's investment has increased.
 
For Short Funds: Compounding Risk: 
The Fund aims to replicate the daily inverse returns of the Underlying Stock and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from Underlying Stock's performance, before fees and expenses. Compounding affects all investments but has a more significant impact on funds that aims to replicate inverse daily returns. For a Fund aiming to replicate the inverse performance of an Underlying Stock, if adverse daily performance of the Underlying Stock reduces the amount of a shareholder's investment, any further adverse daily performance will lead to a smaller dollar loss because the shareholder's investment had already been reduced by the prior adverse performance. Equally, however, if favorable daily performance of the Underlying Stock increases the amount of a shareholder's investment, the dollar amount lost due to future adverse performance will increase because the shareholder's investment has increased.
 
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.
 
A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate.
 
Because the Funds may effect redemptions principally for cash, rather than in-kind distributions, an investment in Funds' shares may be less tax efficient than investments in shares of conventional ETFs, and there may be a substantial difference in the after-tax rate of return between the Funds and conventional ETFs.
 
The Funds may engage in frequent trading of derivatives. Active and frequent trading may lead to the realization and distribution to shareholders of higher short-term capital gains, which would increase their tax liability. Frequent trading also increases transaction costs, such as commissions, which could detract from the Funds'performance.
 
The Funds are not a diversified investment, it may be more volatile than other investments.
 
This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

'The investigation revealed that two former Tesla employees misappropriated the information in violation of Tesla's IT security and data protection policies and shared it with the media outlet,' said Steven Elentukh, Tesla's data privacy officer.

The personal information leaked involved concerns data for certain current and former employees, including name, certain contact information (such as address, phone number, and/or email address), employment-related records, and Social Security numbers belonging to 75,735 current and former employees.

According to the company, a foreign media outlet (named Handelsblatt) informed Tesla on May 10, 2023 that it had obtained Tesla confidential information.

'The outlet has stated that it does not intend to publish the personal information, and in any event, is legally prohibited from using it inappropriately. Tesla immediately took steps to contain the incident, understand the scope, and protect your information,' said the company.

Tesla identified and filed lawsuits against the two former employees. These lawsuits resulted in the seizure of the former employees' electronic devices that were believed to have contained the Tesla information.

Tesla said it also obtained court orders that prohibit the former employees from further use, access, or dissemination of the data, subject to criminal penalties.

Handelsblatt reported in May that Tesla had been hit by a'massive' breach revealing everything from employees' personal information to customer complaints about their cars.

The publication obtained more than 23,000 internal documents, dubbed the'Tesla Files,' containing 100 gigabytes of confidential data.

According to the publication, Musk's Social Security number was also included in the leak.

Back in May, a leak of more than 100 GB of internal data was shared with a German newspaper, revealing certain embarrassing details about Tesla. Contained within the documents was personal, identifiable data about more than 75,000 of its employees, and now the automaker says that insider wrongdoing was behind the data breach.

Tesla blames two former employees for the leak, which is said to contain personal data about its workforce, including Elon Musk's social security number. It made the accusation in a data breach notice filed with Maine's attorney general, and said that it reached the conclusion following an investigation into the situation.

'The investigation revealed that two former Tesla employees misappropriated the information in violation of Tesla's IT security and data protection policies and shared it with the media outlet,' Steven Elentukh, Tesla's data privacy officer, wrote in the notice, Tech Crunch reports.

The automaker has filed lawsuits against the two employees alleged to have leaked the data, and says that their electronic devices were seized. It also obtained court orders to prohibit the employees from using, accessing, or disseminating any more data relating to Tesla. In addition to the allegations, the filing contains a template letter Tesla plans to send to employees whose data was included in the leak.

Handelsblatt, the newspaper that received the leaked data on May 10, has promised to protect sensitive data relating to current and former employees, as is required by law in Germany. It did however report on consumer complaints related to Tesla's advanced driver assistance systems, including reports of sudden acceleration, phantom braking, and more than 1,000 crashes.

It further reported that, in its handling of these customer complaints, the automaker was more interested in protecting its reputation than in helping affected customers. Tesla allegedly used evasive strategies and advised representatives to avoid leaving paper trails with customers in order to prevent reports of its ADAS technologies' shortcomings to become public.

Separately, the automaker has been accused of using similar tactics to deal with customer complaints relating to its vehicles' driving ranges, which are said to be among the most optimistic in the automotive industry.",carscoops.com,8007,news,US,en,Sebastien Bell,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-Tesla-Sales.jpg,False,@Carscoop,7.450142,e26c731de007a586326f7c317f89acc5

4 Reviews

It seems as though you can't shake a tree these days without Tesla Cybertruck sightings falling on your head, but every time the upcoming electric pickup truck is spotted, new details about its features, design, production, or flaws come to light. The most recent Cybertruck sighting to reveal some of the vehicle's secrets comes by way of u/ThrowAwayBarista69 on Reddit.

This sighting is one of very few looks we've had at the interior of the Cybertruck — especially one out on the road as Tesla intended. There are a few notable interior features to be seen in the images, specifically interior ambient lighting, a redesigned yoke with backlit, presumably capacitive, buttons, and a full-screen view of the front bumper camera.

The ambient lighting in the Cybertruck appears to wrap around the vehicle along the top of all the door panels and across the front of the dashboard. While it's set to red in this particular example, the colour is presumably customisable. The updated yoke in the Cybertruck has been seen in previous leaks, but this appears to be the first confirmation we've seen that the Cybertruck will also have white backlighting on its yoke.

Along with a redesigned form, the new yoke also appears to have a different button layout to previous iterations — this aligns with previously-leaked interior shots showing the steering wheel. Along with the redesigned yoke, it appears that the Tesla Cyebrtruck will allow users to use the front camera in an almost-fullscreen view to help gauge distance when approaching objects or following vehicles closely. Perhaps that vast, featureless dash impedes visibility more than Tesla would like.

This particular sighting also gives us a good look at the front LED light bar at night, as opposed to the previous daytime footage that always seemed to have shutter-speed-induced flicker effects interfering with the LED consistency and brightness.",notebookcheck.net,5474,business,AT,en,Julian van der Merwe,https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/tesla-cybertruck-texas-sighting-interior-details.jpeg,False,,6.494094,a28de256c23bce42c34ac9557aa2b7e0

What You Need To Know




Tesla is letting some drivers to use its Autopilot driver-assist system for extended periods without making them put their hands on the steering wheel, a development that has drawn concern from U.S. safety regulators




The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ordered Tesla to tell the agency how many vehicles got a software update making the change and what its plans are for wider distribution




In a July letter to Tesla, the agency says it's concerned that more drivers will activate the change, leading to more driver inattention




The government has been investigating Autopilot for crashing into emergency vehicles parked on freeways, as well as hitting motorcycles and crossing tractor-trailers. At least 17 people have died in crashes




 
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ordered Tesla to tell the agency how many vehicles have received a software update making that possible and it's seeking more information on what the electric vehicle maker's plans are for wider distribution.


""NHTSA is concerned that this feature was introduced to consumer vehicles, and now that the existence of this feature is known to the public, more drivers may attempt to activate it,"" John Donaldson, the agency's acting chief counsel, wrote in a July 26 letter to Tesla that was posted on the agency's website. ""The resulting relaxation of controls designed to ensure that the driver remain engaged in the dynamic driving task could lead to greater driver inattention and failure of the driver to properly supervise Autopilot.""


A message was left early Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla. ""If you haven't tried Tesla Autopilot, you don't know how awesome it is,"" Musk wrote Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter.


The government has been investigating Autopilot for crashing into emergency vehicles parked on freeways, as well as hitting motorcycles and crossing tractor-trailers. It opened a formal probe in 2021 and since 2016 has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes that may involve partially automated driving systems. At least 17 people have died.


Tesla says Autopilot and a more sophisticated ""Full Self-Driving"" system cannot drive themselves and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. Autopilot generally can keep a car in its lane and a distance away from objects in front of it.


The special order tells Tesla to describe differences in the software update that reduces or eliminates instances where Autopilot tells drivers to apply pressure on the steering wheel, ""including the amount of time that Autopilot is allowed to operate without prompting torque, and any warnings or chimes that are presented to the driver.""


The letter to Tesla Senior Legal Director Dinna Eskin orders the Austin, Texas, company to say why it installed the software update and how it justifies which consumers got it.


It also seeks reports of crashes and near misses involving vehicles with the software update. ""Your response should include any plans to enable the subject software in consumer vehicles within the next calendar year,"" Donaldson wrote in the letter.


A Tesla officer has to respond to the letter under oath by Aug. 25 or the agency will refer the matter to the Justice Department, which can seek a maximum penalty of more than $131 million.


Tesla's system of monitoring drivers has been criticized by safety advocates and the National Transportation Safety Board for letting drivers check out when Autopilot is operating.


After investigating three crashes involving Autopilot, the NTSB recommended in 2017 that Tesla and five other automakers limit where the partially automated systems can be used to limited-access divided highways, and to bolster their systems that monitor drivers.


All of the automakers but Tesla responded. In 2021 NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk calling on him to act on the recommendations. The NTSB said Musk never responded.


The NTSB investigates crashes but has no regulatory authority. It can only make recommendations to automakers or other federal agencies such as NHTSA.


Most other automakers use an infrared camera to make sure a driver is paying attention. Some Teslas lately have been equipped with cameras that watch drivers.


Jake Fisher, who heads auto testing for Consumer Reports, said Tesla may have activated the cameras to monitor drivers, and that may be the reason for relaxing the steering wheel notifications.


But during its last test of Autopilot in 2022, the cameras didn't do anything, and older Teslas aren't equipped with the cameras, Fisher said. However, the cameras did monitor drivers when using ""Full Self-Driving,"" Fisher said.


Cameras, he said, are better at ensuring that drivers pay attention than steering wheel monitors.


Tesla owners refer to alerts about hands on the steering wheel as ""nags.""


When Autopilot was first introduced in 2015, it warned drivers to pay attention if it didn't feel torque on the steering wheel for about three minutes, Fisher said. Later that was reduced to 30 seconds, but it changes between software updates, he said. ""It always seems to be jumping around,"" he said.


Consumer Reports also has found that it's easy to bypass Tesla's steering wheel monitoring system.


Earlier this month NHTSA sent investigators to a crash in Virginia in which a Tesla apparently on Autopilot ran underneath a tractor-trailer, killing the driver.",mynews13.com,5219,news,US,en,Associated Press,https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Tesla Autopilot Investigation,False,,8.4571295,faf8af3cbb79d626912ca14fb37806aa
537,The Reasons Behind The Unexplained Departure Of Tesla Cfo Shortseller,MENAFN,2023-09-01 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106997717/The-Reasons-Behind-The-Unexplained-Departure-Of-Tesla-Cfo-Shortseller,menafn.com,"Stanphyl Capital's commentary for the month ended August 31, 2023, discussing their short position in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Table of","The big August news from Tesla was the sudden and unexplained departure of its CFO, the latest in a series of sudden and unexplained Tesla CFO departures. One possible explanation is obvious: Elon Musk is a pathological liar and securities fraudster'in plain sight.'

Why would he let his CFOs run the books honestly when they're not'in plain sight' and hundreds of billions of dollars of his personal compensation depends on their results? Perhaps at some point the latest CFO decided he had pulled enough money out of the company (an incredible $590 million !) and wanted to be free to spend it, rather than behind bars dreaming about it!

Or perhaps the CFO's resignation was tied into July's Reuters revelation of a massive & systemic Elon Musk-directed consumer fraud regarding the range of Tesla's cars, or Musk's alleged theft of company assets to build himself a house, both of which it was revealed in August are being investigated by the DOJ.

Or perhaps the CFO quit because in May Handelsblatt revealed a massive & systemic Tesla safety cover-up while people continue to die in (or because of) Teslas at an astounding pace . Regardless, whether from these transgressions or something else, Musk will go down because people like him always do.

Meanwhile, in July Tesla reported Q2 earnings that proved once again it's now just a low-margin car company forced to continually slash prices to maintain delivery volume, and on the conference call Musk insinuated that the price-slashing will continue (as it did yet again in China in August ). Rather than discuss the report here with my usual verbiage, I shall instead post a few of my Tweets from the night it was released:

And one from Jim Chanos:

Yes, please don't lecture me about Tesla's'energy business,' which in Q2 accounted for just 6% of revenue (declining from 6.5% in Q1) and likely has amargin in the mid-single digits as it's in an extremely competitive, low-margin industry.

Also, Tesla recently announced that it will open its U.S. charging stations to cars from multiple other manufacturers which, in turn, will adopt Tesla's connector and charging protocol. (Those competitors are building their own network, too.)

Seeing as many people only buy a Tesla instead of a competing EV in order to access those chargers, and seeing as all the competing charging networks will also adopt this protocol while paying Tesla nothing (Tesla open-sourced it), this will cost Tesla far more in lost auto sale profits than the pennies per share it may gain from charging profits. Thus, any increase in Tesla's stock price that can be attributed to this is as ridiculas the increase attributed to its'AI' that regularly sends Teslas crashing into other vehicles, people, trees and buildings.

Tesla has objectively lost its'product edge,' with many competing cars now offering comparable or better real-world range , better interiors, similar or faster charging speeds and much better quality. Tesla ranks near the bottom of both Consumer Reports' reliability survey and the 2023 JD Power survey :

In fact, Tesla is likely now the second, third or fourth choice for many EV buyers, and only maintains its volume lead though a short-lived edge in production capacity that will disappear over the next 12 to 36 months as competitors rapidly increase the ability to produce their superior EVs.

Tesla's poorly-built Model Y faces competition from the much better made (and often just better) electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 , Kia EV6 , Ford Mustang Mach E , Cadillac Lyriq , Nissan Ariya , Audi Q4 e-tron , BMW iX3 , Mercedes EQB , Chevrolet Blazer EV & Equinox EV , Volvo XC-40 Recharge and Polestar 3 . And Tesla's Model 3 now has terrific direct'sedan competition' from Volvo's beautiful Polestar 2 , BMW's i4 , Hyundai's Ioniq 6 and Volkswagen's ID.7 , as well as multiple local competitors in China.

And in the high-end electric car segment worldwide the Porsche Taycan outsells the Model S, while the spectacular new BMW i7 , Mercedes EQS and EQE , Audi e-Tron GT and Lucid Air make the Tesla look like a fast Yugo, while the extremely well reviewed new BMW iX , Mercedes EQS SUV and Audi Q8 eTron (as well as multiple new Chinese models) do the same to the Model X.

And oh, the joke of a'pickup truck' Tesla first previewed in 2019 (and still hasn't shown in production-ready form) won't be much of'growth engine' either, as by the time it's in meaningful mass-production in 2024 that grotesque-looking kluge will enter a dogfight of a market vs. Ford's F-150 Lightning , GM's electric Silverado , the Dodge Ram REV and Rivian's R1T .

Indeed, for years I've said'Tesla is Blackberry' -the maker of a first-generation version of a product that-once the market was proven-would be supplanted into niche obscurity by newer, better versions, and now it's finally happening. I believe Musk knows this (hence his recent'Twitter buying distraction'), with VW Group, Hyundai/Kia, Ford, GM, Stellantis, BMW, Mercedes, BYD & other Chinese competitors and, in a few years, Toyota, Nissan & Honda, stealing Tesla's share and pounding its stock price into the low double-digits, where it will be valued as'just another car company.'

Meanwhile, the NHhas initiated the first of what will likely be multiple recalls of Tesla's fraudulently named'Full Self Driving' (even before the aforementioned safety cover-up revealed by Handelsblatt), and in January it was revealed that Elon Musk personally directed its fake, fraudulent promotional video (something extremely similar to what Theranos did with its blood machines and Nikola with its truck ), and that the DOJ is investigating him for it and so is the SEC .

The refund liability potential for Tesla for this is in the billions of dollars, and possibly even the tens of billions if a class action lawsuit proves that the cars involved were purchased solely due to the (fallacious) promise of'full self-driving.' And, of course, there will be a massive'valuation reappraisal' for Tesla's stock as the world wakes up to the fact that its so-called'autonomy technology' is deadly, trailing-edge garbage that Consumer Reports now ranks just seventh vs. competitors' systems (behind Ford, GM, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota and Volkswagen) and Guidehouse Insights now rates dead last :

Yet Tesla has sold this trashy software for almost seven years now...

...and still promotes it on its website via the aforementioned completely fraudulent video ! (For all Tesla-related deaths cited in the media-which is likely only a small fraction of those that have occurred-please see this spreadsheet .)

Another favorite Tesla hype story has been built around so-called'proprietary battery technology.' In fact though, Tesla has nothing proprietary there-it doesn't make them, it buys them from Panasonic , CATL and LG , and it's the biggest liar in the industry regarding the real-world range of its cars. And if new-format 4680 cells enter the market, even if Tesla makes some of its own,

other manufacturers will gladly sell them to anyone , and BMW has already announced it will buy them from CATL and EVE.

538,The Tesla Cybertruck might always look a little messed up,Insider,2023-08-29 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/08/29/the-tesla-cybertruck-might-always-look-a-little-messed-up/,autoblog.com,"The heavy use of stainless steel on Tesla Cybertruck's exterior will make it hard to keep looking pristine, design and manufacturing experts said.","Tesla's Cybertruck
 
Frederic J. Brown/AFP
 
 
 
The polarizing polygon known as the 
Tesla Cybertruck
 is almost here, and it will probably look far from perfect when it finally hits the road.
 
Thanks to its 
unusually flat body panels and extensive use of stainless steel,
 the sci-fi-inspired 
truck
 likely won't be nearly as sleek and perfect as Tesla's polished renderings have suggested, design and manufacturing experts told Insider.
 
And remember: Although Tesla has shaken up the car business in countless ways, it's always 
struggled with nagging quality issues
 that premium competitors like 
BMW
 and 
Lexus
 don't deal with.
 
It all means that 
Cybertruck buyers 
who have suffered through years of delays may wind up with trucks that always look a little rough around the edges. How much of that roughness customers can stomach could make or break this crucial product launch, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.
 
""This is going to be a measure of the appeal of Tesla,"" Fiorani said.
 
Stainless steel will always get dirty in a matter of minutes
 
Making those flat, shiny body panels actually look nice will be easier said than done, Geoff Wardle, a former car designer who runs the transportation design program at California's ArtCenter College of Design, told Insider. Just look at this photo Tesla boss Elon Musk recently posted of a ""production candidate"" truck.
 
Imperfections in the doors and other panels make the vehicle look like a rolling funhouse mirror — not exactly the uniform, space-age truck that was promised. The effect was more pronounced in earlier Cybertruck photos, but it's still noticeable here, just weeks away from customer deliveries.
 
""You are going to see funny reflections"" in the finished product, Wardle said, adding that the side of the truck looks less like a cohesive design and more like ""four flat panels that happen to be adjacent to each other.""
 
Another potential issue he foresees: 
fingerprints
.
 
Anyone who's owned a stainless steel fridge knows they are a magnet for grime and are a nightmare to keep clean. Now imagine that issue on practically every surface of your truck, which is routinely exposed to nasty environments.
 
He isn't sure any of it will matter to the Cybertruck's most enthusiastic fans.
 
""Maybe customers are going to like them to get all grubby and dirty and have that sort of 'Star Wars' look about it,"" he said. ""But for more traditional folks, they might be bothered about paying probably a lot of money for this car and finding that the doors and the fenders look like they're warped.""
 
Musk knows the Cybertruck needs to be perfect
 
Musk himself has indicated he's concerned about how the Cybertruck will look in its final form, saying in a 
leaked email to staff
 last week: ""Due to the nature of Cybertruck, which is made of bright metal with mostly straight edges, any dimensional variation shows up like a sore thumb.""
 
He's right. For years, Tesla buyers have complained about glaringly misaligned body panels, and those kinds of issues stick out in early Cybertruck photos. Just look at Musk's recent post again, and zero in this time on the spot by the headlight. Instead of a clean edge, you see a weird gap.
 
Tesla has always been able to get away with a level of imperfection, thanks to a rabid fanbase that cares more about cutting-edge technology than craftsmanship. But the Cybertruck is a different ballgame, Fiorani said.
 
""Musk has learned from his past mistakes – he understands that people will scrutinize this vehicle,"" Fiorani said. ""Then you add in the complexity of a vehicle like the Cybertruck, where the smallest blemish will show up as a glaring error. He recognizes the issue with that.""

""Just want to reiterate that there is no glass house (metaphors don't count lol) built, under construction or planned,' Musk posted on X.

""I'm not building any house of any kind anywhere. Period,' he added.

According to the Wall Street Journal, federal prosecutors are investigating Tesla's use of company funds on a secret project that had been described internally as a house for Chief Executive Musk.

TheAttorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has reportedly sought information about what benefits have been paid to Musk,

how much Tesla spent on the project, and what the project was for, the report mentioned.

The SEC has also opened a civil investigation into Tesla's 'Project 42'.

Earlier reports mentioned that Musk once planned a lavish glass house for himself near Tesla headquarters in Austin, Texas, worth millions of dollars.

The secret project included renderings of a glass box with residential features, such as bedrooms, bathrooms and a kitchen, reports claimed.

The project reportedly triggered an internal probe over ""possible improprieties"", over concerns that Musk might be using company funds to

build the house.

The concepts for the house included either a ""twisted hexagon"" or a glass cube reminiscent of Apple's 5th Avenue store.

Whether you're a total petrolhead and are constantly staying up-to-date on every major automotive brand's new model launch, or you simply have a taste for the finer things in life, we're all guilty of envying the flashiest, most modern cars we see being driven down the street.

You may have even looked into brands like Tesla before. The mind-blowing tech features and futuristic style of their vehicles dancing before your eyes like some prize that will always remain just beyond your grasp.

Well, if you're someone who has always merely assumed that Tesla vehicles are reserved for the exorbitantly wealthy, you might want to read more into car leasing.

While you may have heard about car leasing, you'll probably be intrigued to find that it's a practice applicable to even the flashiest, most high-end vehicles on the market. One example is a very accessible Tesla Model 3 lease .

Just like some of the world's wealthiest, you could be behind the wheel of a futuristic Tesla Model 3 for a fraction of the price of purchasing one, and no long-term commitment to a depreciating asset.

If you've traditionally always bought your cars or you've never owned a vehicle before, you might still be unsure about exactly what car leasing is and how it works.

Leasing allows the driver to have full-time possession of a vehicle for a fixed period of time, usually between 24 and 60 months, during which they pay a predictable, fixed monthly fee.

At the end of the lease period, the driver can usually return the vehicle to the dealership and lease a new vehicle on a new contract.

Every lease agreement is different, and the terms outlined in each agreement can be customised to suit the individual or business needs of the leasing party.

Both individuals and organisations can lease vehicles – individuals will usually use a Personal Contract Hire lease, and organisations will use a Business Contract Hire lease.

These agreements function similarly, but the main difference is that organisations can claim back a portion of their VAT and are subject to certain benefits and tax deductibility that make leasing particularly appealing.

Apart from Personal Contract Hire and Business Contract Hire, there are several other types of leases that an individual or company can choose from.

From open-end to closed-end leases, short-term or long-term leases, eventual ownership leases and single-payment leases, there is a leasing solution to suit every type of budget and lifestyle.

The most important takeaway here is that you do thorough research on varidealership offerings, carefully read the terms of your lease agreement, and enquire about possible changes or negotiations that can be made.

For example, package additions such as an extended mileage allowance for drivers who travel frequently, maintenance and servicing appointments, and above-average wear and tear allowances can be worked into the lease agreement at the beginning of the lease period for an increased fee.

Car leasing appeals to many individuals and businesses because of its affordable monthly rates, lower initial down payment, avoidance of depreciation, and the ability to drive a new car more frequently without a long-term commitment to a particular vehicle.

However, it's a common misconception that car leases are reserved for more everyday vehicles, as many dealerships offer leases for brand-new, top-of-the-range luxury vehicles. The Tesla Model 3, first launched in 2017, is a classic example.

The Tesla Model 3 comes in three specifications: the Standard Plus, the Long Range, and the Performance. This speedy, fun electric vehicle is packed with advanced tech features and boasts a sporty and daring exterior design.

One of its main selling features is that it was designed to prioritise safety, achieving a Euro NCAP 5-star safety rating in every category as well as overall.

It was crafted to have a very low rollover risk as well as front impact protection, a front-facing radar that detects obstructions that are 160 metres ahead of the vehicle, cameras on all sides to give 360-degree visibility of the driver's surroundings and 12 ultrasonic sensors to help with parking and navigation.

Because this model is fully electric, the driver can charge it at home or on any Tesla charging network. When charged fully, the battery life can give 348 miles of travel.

As well as its advanced safety features and beautiful exterior, this vehicle also sports a comfortable, tech-savvy and luxuriinterior.

A glass roof extends from the front to the back of the vehicle, offering sizeable headroom that is smartly equipped with protection from UV rays, and a 15-inch touchscreen display allows for easy navigation of the car's many features and tools.

Heated seats, heated side mirrors and even a heated steering wheel create optimal comfort for the driver and passengers.

As the effects of climate change become more and more apparent, so does the need for accessible hybrid and electric vehicle options.

Tesla is just one of the many car companies working hard to make this possible, and the existence of lease agreements makes their innovative, environmentally-friendly vehicles even more attainable for the average driver on a budget.

You might be thinking that the vehicle's reliance on Tesla charging networks would be a drawback, especially while driving long distances.

If so, it might comfort you to know that Tesla currently has over 45 000 Global Superchargers, with 16 000 of them situated on popular travel routes. Plus, it only takes 30 minutes to recharge the Tesla Model 3 to 170 miles.

If you've ever shrugged off the idea of driving a hybrid or electric model because you assumed these vehicles were financially out of reach, despite knowing how much better they are for our planet, it's time to think again.

Lease agreements for vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3 are available today, making these futuristic, innovative drives more attainable than ever before.

Get behind the wheel of a Tesla Model 3 today with a flexible, budget-friendly lease agreement, and you'll never look back.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/30/R&AN_e23f6image_story.png,False,@menafn,7.728968,52d4f7871eaabab1722b487ac0028e59

This paper describes a new MR imaging technique known as downfield MR spectroscopic imaging (DF-MRSI) that has only recently been shown to be possible in the human brain on commonly available 3 Tesla MRI scanners. This is the first application of this methodology to human brain tumors.
Purpose: To investigate the use of 3D downfield proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (DF-MRSI) for evaluation of tumor recurrence in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: Seven patients (4F, age range 44–65 and mean ± standard deviation 59.3 ± 7.5 years) with previously treated GBM were scanned using a recently developed 3D DF-MRSI sequence at 3T. Short TE 3D DF-MRSI and water reference 3D-MRSI scans were collected with a nominal spatial resolution of 0.7 cm
3
. DF volume data in eight slices covered 12 cm of brain in the cranio-caudal axis. Data were analyzed using the ‘LCModel' program and a basis set containing nine peaks ranging in frequency between 6.83 to 8.49 ppm. The DF8.18 (assigned to amides) and DF7.90 peaks were selected for the creation of metabolic images and statistical analysis. Longitudinal MR images and clinical history were used to classify brain lesions as either recurrent tumor or treatment effect, which may include necrosis. DF-MRSI data were compared between lesion groups (recurrent tumor, treatment effect) and normal-appearing brain. Results: Of the seven brain tumor patients, two were classified as having recurrent tumor and the rest were classified as treatment effect. Amide metabolite levels from recurrent tumor regions were significantly (
p
 < 0.05) higher compared to both normal-appearing brain and treatment effect regions. Amide levels in lesion voxels classified as treatment effect were significantly lower than normal brain. Conclusions: 3D DF-MRSI in human brain tumors at 3T is feasible and was well tolerated by all patients enrolled in this preliminary study. Amide levels measured by 3D DF-MRSI were significantly different between treatment effect and tumor regrowth.


 










 


Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and frequently encountered primary brain tumor in adults [
1
]. Maximal possible surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy (XRT) and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, is the standard of care treatment [
2
,
3
]. Despite intensive research effort, overall survival for patients with GBM remains at around 15 months [
4
,
5
,
6
]. Currently, assessment of therapy response in GBM is performed primarily using MRI. However, recurrent tumor and effects of treatment (including radiation necrosis) may have similar appearance on MRI and are often difficult to distinguish as a result. Interpretation of MRI is also complicated by the commonly encountered phenomena of ‘pseudoprogression' and ‘pseudoresponse' [
7
]. Therefore, accurate differentiation of recurrent tumor from treatment effects, including radiation necrosis and edema, remains challenging [
8
,
9
].
Due to this, other advanced MR techniques including diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), MR perfusion imaging (PWI), conventional upfield (<4.7 ppm) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and more recently magnetization transfer [
10
,
11
], amide-proton transfer chemical exchange saturation transfer (APT-CEST) MRI [
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
,
17
,
18
] have all been investigated for evaluating treatment response in GBM. APT-CEST MRI has been shown to be promising in several applications related to imaging human brain tumors, such as differentiating between high- and low-grade tumors, or assessing the effects of treatment on tumor regrowth [
19
,
20
,
21
]. The principal contrast mechanism in APT-CEST is chemical exchange between the amide groups of mobile proteins and the observed brain water signal; APT hyperintensity is therefore usually attributed either to increased protein amide content in actively growing tumors, and/or increased exchange rates, which depend on factors such as pH [
22
,
23
]. However, there are also some other possible mechanisms that may lead to contrast in APT-CEST images, depending on how the images are acquired and processed, and on what post hoc corrections are applied. Some of these factors include (a) the effect of changes in brain water T
1
 relaxation times (which are increased in many brain lesions), and (b) significant contrast from the relayed Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) [
21
]. Therefore, it might be advantageous to have an independent measurement of protein amide levels in the brain.
MRS can also be used to directly observe amide resonances downfield (DF) from water (>4.7 ppm), although care has to be taken to avoid saturation of the water signal, as exchange between water and amides causes attenuation of the amide signals if water suppression using pre-saturation is performed. DF MRS in the human brain has been previously performed using single voxel (SV) spatial localization at various field strengths [
11
,
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
], including in a rodent brain tumor model [
28
]. Recently, techniques for mapping of DF resonances (DF-MRSI, including amides) have been developed and demonstrated for both 2D and 3D encoding at the widely available field strength of 3T [
29
,
30
]. While SV localization has a number of advantages for MRS, including optimization of field homogeneity on the target region and short scan times, it does also have a number of limitations, the main one being that it provides little or no information on the spatial distribution of metabolite signals. This is particularly a problem for studies in patients with focal brain lesions, such as tumors, which are notoriously inhomogeneous, and the results obtained will often be highly dependent on the SV MRS voxel placement [
31
]. SV MRS also becomes inefficient when multiple brain regions are of interest to be examined. In contrast, MRSI allows for spectra from multiple brain regions to be recorded simultaneously and maps of the metabolite resonances to be reconstructed in post-processing [
31
]. Our recent paper [
30
] has shown that near whole-brain coverage is possible for DF-MRSI at a nominal spatial resolution of 0.7 cm [
3
] in a scan time of just over 20 min at the clinically widely available field strength of 3T. This spatial resolution is similar to that of other metabolic imaging techniques in human brain (e.g., fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), or upfield MRSI) and is sufficient for the study of many different neurological or oncological diseases, including most brain tumors [
32
].
In addition to the amide resonances of mobile proteins (~8.1 to 8.4 ppm), a number of other compounds have functional groups that may be visible in the downfield region of the spectrum, including the amide resonance of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, 7.9 ppm), two resonances from the imidazole group of homocarnosine (~7.1 and 8.0 ppm), glutathione (8.3, 8.5 ppm), ATP (~8.2 and 8.5 ppm), and others [
24
,
26
]. Some compounds may become more visible in the downfield region under pathological conditions (e.g., phenylalanine, ~7.3–7.4 ppm, in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) [
33
]), or with administration of exogeneous substances (e.g., histidine, ~7.1 and 7.8 ppm) [
34
]. Recently, using a 7T scanner and very large voxel sizes to give high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), it has also been possible to assign signals to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, ~8.9, 9.2, 9.3 ppm) and L-tryptophan (L-Trp, ~10.1 ppm) [
35
]. MRS visibility of DF resonances depends on several factors, including the metabolite concentration and exchange rate with water [
29
,
36
]. Even when water suppression using pre-saturation is not used, the linewidths and T
2
 relaxation times of DF resonances will depend on their water exchange rates, and those that are rapidly exchanging with water will not be visible in the DF spectrum. Therefore DF-MRSI is expected to be most sensitive for functional groups that have relatively slow exchange with water, unlike APT-CEST where sensitivity is more optimal for intermediate exchange rates. Ultimately, therefore, DF-MRSI and APT-CEST may be techniques that offer complementary (rather than identical) information of brain amide levels, looking at amide pools that differ in water exchange rates.
This paper reports initial results of 3D DF-MRSI in a small cohort of patients with GBM who were being followed for tumor recurrence post treatment. The purposes of the study were to determine feasibility, as well as to examine possible differences in DF-metabolite levels, focusing on the major 8.18 and 7.90 ppm resonances, between recurrent tumor, normal brain, and treatment effects.
Seven patients (4F, age range 44–65, mean ± s.d. 59.3 ± 7.5 years) with previously treated GBM were scanned using a recently developed 3D DF-MRSI protocol and a Philips 3T ‘Ingenia Elition' scanner equipped with a 32-receive channel head coil [
37
]. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and all participants provided written informed consent.
The MR protocol consisted of 3D T
1
-weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)-weighted images, followed by proton density (PD) localizer images for DF-MRSI.
Three-dimensional DF-MRSI data with a nominal spatial resolution of 7 × 7 × 15 mm were acquired from a field of view of 200 × 180 × 120 mm, matrix size 29 × 26 × 8, scan time 22 m 42 s. A 3D volume consisting of eight 15 mm slices was recorded in oblique axial prescription covering from the base of the cerebellum to the vertex (
Figure 1
A). Scan parameters were TR 287 ms, TE 22 ms, flip angle 78°, 1 excitation, with an inferior saturation pulse applied. Shimming was performed using the ‘FastMAP' technique for the optimization of the B
0
 field homogeneity up to 2nd order. Details of the pulse sequence, spectral-spatial excitation, and frequency selective refocusing pulses can be found in reference [
30
].
A non-water suppressed FID-MRSI scan was also recorded at the same resolution, slice locations, and matrix size as the DF-MRSI. Scan parameters for FID-MRSI were TR 264 ms, TE 1 ms, flip angle 30°, 1 excitation, SENSE acceleration (R = 2), scan time 11 m 14 s.
Longitudinal, clinical MRI scans performed as part of each patient's routine care, including administration of a contrast agent, were evaluated by a neuroradiologist according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria [
38
], and used to classify lesions observed on the research MR exam as either disease progression or treatment effect. Target regions of interest (ROIs) were identified in each case on the FLAIR images recorded in the same session as DF-MRSI, and these coordinates were then transferred, for instance as shown in 
Figure 1
, for a quantitative analysis of the lesion and uninvolved brain (usually contralateral to the lesion). Usually, 4 MRSI voxels from each region were chosen for analysis (
Figure 1
B).
DF data were analyzed using the previously described post-processing pipeline [
30
]. Briefly, DF signals were frequency corrected on a voxel-by-voxel basis using the H
2
O MRSI data. An HLSVD filter for water removal was then applied before quantification with ‘LCModel' software [
39
,
40
,
41
,
42
] using a basis set consisting of 9 Gaussian DF peaks. LCModel usually analyzes in vivo spectra as a linear combination of model spectra from individual metabolites (obtained either via spectral simulation or recoding of in vitro solutions [
42
,
43
]); however, in the case of DF MRS, because many of the resonances have not currently been definitively assigned to specific metabolites, DF-MRSI data were analyzed as a linear combination of the 9 individual Gaussian peaks. These peaks were based on prior studies, most notably that of Fichtner et al. [
25
], who analyzed high-field (9.4T) DF spectra of the human brain and found that the spectra were best characterized by a group of 12 peaks; the 9 values used here reflect the lower field strength (3T) of the current study as well as the smaller frequency range covered using the current pulse sequence (~6.8 to 8.5 ppm); in the 9.4T study, peak frequencies ranged from 5.8 to 8.5 ppm. LCModel performs a least-squares minimization between the model and experimental data, where the model parameters include estimated concentrations, zero and first-order phase corrections, frequency shift, linewidth, and cubic spline baseline correction. The baseline stiffness was set using the control parameter 'DKNTMN' = 5. In addition, uncertainty estimates (Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds, CRLB) are provided for each resonance. CRLBs were not used to filter results since this has been suggested to be a potential source of bias [
44
]; however, for the reported resonances (see below), generally CRLBs were <50% in most brain regions. The control file including all fitting parameters for LCModel is provided in the 
supplemental information
. Examples of LCModel fits in one patient for both lesion and normal-appearing tissue are shown in 
Figure 1
C,D. Concentration values output from the LCModel are reported in ‘institutional units', since they are not corrected for tissue water content, relaxation times, and other technical factors related to the DF-MRSI acquisition and therefore cannot be equated to conventional biochemical units such as millimolar or micromoles per gram wet weight.
Finally, DF amide (8.18 ppm) and DF7.90 ppm maps were reconstructed from the LCModel peak area estimates and linearly interpolated by a factor of 8 for display purposes. These two resonances were chosen because they are the most prominent signals in the DF spectrum, and therefore give the highest quality metabolic images; in addition, the 8.18 ppm peak is assigned to mobile protein amide groups, which are believed to be increased in brain tumors, and a principal component of the contrast seen in APT-CEST images. Also, the 7.90 ppm peak is often assigned to the amide group of NAA, which is known to be decreased in most brain lesions. Brain masks were calculated from localizer PD MR images and co-aligned with DF maps.

In China, the world's largest auto market, the refreshed version of the Model 3 came with a starting price 12 percent higher than the previous, base rear-wheel drive model, reversing a trend toward price cuts which had sparked a price war between Tesla and its Chinese EV rivals.
The updated version of the Model 3 was Tesla's first new or restyled car since it launched its global best-seller, the Model Y, in 2020. Tesla plans to start production of its Cybertruck later this year.
The rollout of the Model 3 in China and markets to which Tesla exports from its manufacturing hub there suggested that its Shanghai plant would be first to make the model. Tesla also makes the Model 3 at its plant in Fremont, California.

The new Model 3 promises a longer driving range for China, according to the company's website. The standard version has a rated range of 606 kilometers based on China's testing standards. That's about 9 percent higher than the base model it replaces in China.
Tesla said it had started taking orders and would begin deliveries in China in the fourth quarter. In Australia, deliveries were set for January.
Tesla sold 64,285 China-made electric vehicles in July, down 31 percent from a month earlier, the most recent data from the China Passenger Car Association showed.
In a statement issued by its China operations, Tesla said the new model featured a better acoustic system, an improved and more comfortable interior and a display screen for back-seat passengers. Images of the exterior showed small changes that gave the sedan a sleeker front and new headlights.
The Tesla announcement came days before the Munich auto show where German automakers are expected to announce a run of new EVs. Those include a new version of the Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE ID.7 and a new electric CLA model sedan from Mercedes MBGn.DE.
Reuters first reported last November that Tesla was developing a revamped version of the Model 3 in a project codenamed ""Highland."" People involved in the project said it was aimed at cutting production costs and boosting the appeal of the model.
In China, the new Model 3 starts at $35,807.78, the company's website showed Friday.",Copyright(c) 2009 Chosun.com All rights reserved.,2615,news,KR,en,VOA News,https://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2023/09/02/2023090200455_0.jpg,False,@TheChosunilbo,7.5396585,02b03f829749601c51c0cfe3a535244f

The revised Model 3 marks the first time that the automaker, led by Elon Musk, has launched a new electric vehicle model in China ahead of the U.S.

The new Model 3 is being built at Tesla's Shanghai assembly plant and comes with a starting price that is 12% higher than the previbase model in China.

The newest Model 3 will be exported from China to other markets in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

The new Model 3 is Tesla's first change to its mass-market vehicle line-up since it launched the Model Y in 2020.

Tesla plans to debut the latest Model 3 at a trade show in Beijing on September 2 and has said that new features include a rear display for back-seat passengers and a longer driving range.

Specifically, the company said the driving range on the new Model 3 has been increased by about 9% to 606 km on a single battery charge.

Tesla said it has started taking orders and would begin deliveries of the revamped Model 3 in China in the fourth quarter of this year.

The company has not yet announced a launch date for the new Model 3 in the U.S. market.

In announcing the new Model 3, Tesla also said it is cutting the prices for its premium Model S and Model X electric vehicles by 14% to 21% in both China and the U.S., its two biggest markets.

Tesla has been lowering prices and offering discount incentives on its vehicles throughout this year as it tries to boost declining sales.

Following a fanatical public discourse around numerous spy shots and speculations, the new Model 3 could be one of the most anticipated electric vehicles of the year.
 
The updated 
Model 3
, which was apparently internally codenamed Project Highland, is more chiselled, flaunts a redesigned front and rear, and gets a revamped interior. 
Tesla
 said it has improved its aerodynamics to extract more range and to reduce drag and wind noise. For now, the updates have come only to the rear-wheel-drive and long-range (LR) versions.
 
The front end is edgier than before with cleaner character lines, a redesigned headlamp housing, and new signature LED daytime running lights. The crease at the edge of the bonnet that previously tapered off under the headlamps is now much sharper and extends to the wings/fenders.
 
The side profile remains identical, while the rear end features prominent wraparound C-shaped taillights, with Tesla now spelled out between the lights, replacing the logo. The multi-spoke wheel design is also new. The brand is adding two new colours, Ultra Red and Stealth Gray.
 
 Gallery: Tesla Model 3 Facelift 
 
The dimensions remain largely the same, but the Model 3 is now longer by 25 millimetres (1 inch), measuring 4,720 mm (185.8 in), while it is one-tenth of an inch shorter in height at 1,441 mm (56.7 in). Ground clearance on the other hand is negligibly reduced from 140 mm (5.5 in) to 138 mm (5.4 in), as per the spec sheet.
 
The estimated WLTP range for the updated RWD Model 3 with 18-inch wheels is 344 miles (554 kilometres), while the LR variant is good for 421 miles (678 km). That's roughly an 11 to 12 percent increase from the current models' WLTP range of 305 and 374 miles, respectively. Note that the EPA figures will vary significantly for the US-spec electric saloon.
 
With the optional 19-inch 'Nova' wheels, the RWD Model 3 will go 319 miles (513 km) on a single charge on the WLTP cycle, while the LR version is rated for 391 miles (629 km). Performance figures appear to have remained the same, with a 0-62 mile-per-hour time of 6.1 seconds for the RWD model, and 4.4 seconds for the LR all-wheel-drive variant.
 
The new RWD version (19-inch rims) consumes 13.2 kilowatt hours for every 62 miles (100 km) on the European test cycle, while the LR uses 14.0 kWh for the same distance.
 
The Model 3 interior now appears more lounge-like. It features a wraparound design, with an 'enveloping architecture' featuring aluminium and fabric materials. The new ambient lighting covers the entire cabin. The brand claimed that the cabin is quieter thanks to acoustic glass and improved soundproofing materials.
 
There's more digital real estate inside. The 15.4-inch central screen is the same size but features slimmer bezels for a more usable screen area. There's also a new 8.0-inch rear display with integrated climate, ventilation, and infotainment controls. Tesla has replaced the column-mounted levers with steering-mounted controls, like the 
Model S
 and 
Model X
.

LR model customers will now enjoy music from 17 speakers, three more than before, with two subwoofers and two amplifiers. The RWD will get nine speakers, one subwoofer, and one amplifier. Tesla is also claiming a more powerful microphone to improve call quality.
 
Deliveries of the updated Model 3 will begin in late October in Europe and the Middle East. We're expecting Tesla to announce details about the North American model and its availability soon.
 
Several reports indicate that 
production of the refreshed Model 3 is already underway at Gigafactory Shanghai
, which is the largest producer of Tesla EVs, and a global export hub. The North American version will likely be US-made, at the brand's Fremont facility in California where

Elon Musk's Tesla almost ran a red light at a Palo Alto intersection during a live demo of an unreleased version of 
Tesla's Full Self-Driving software
. The drive was 
live-streamed on X
, formerly known as Twitter.
 
The video appears to show Musk grabbing the steering wheel after the software misread a traffic signal and tried to accelerate at a red light.
 
""This is our first intervention because the car should be going straight,"" the billionaire said after halting the car around 20 minutes into the video. ""This is why we've not released it to the public yet,"" he added.
 
Representatives for 
Tesla
 did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside normal working hours.
 
The video demonstrated v12 of Tesla's FSD technology, which has not yet been released to consumers. The software appeared to perform safely for the rest of the 45-minute video, navigating around the city and tackling roundabouts during the drive.
 
Tesla has been testing its 
Full Self-Driving software 
for several years, but progress has been stalled by lawsuits and investigations aimed at probing the tech's safety.
 
The software's beta version was released to some Tesla owners in 2020 and is now available to anyone who pays for it. The beta version is in around 400,000 Teslas, 
according to a company announcement posted early this year.
 
During the video, the Tesla CEO may have violated California law by holding his phone during the live-streamed drive. When contacted about the potential violation, the Palo Alto Police Department 
told The Verge
 they wouldn't be issuing a fine because police didn't see the incident themselves.

Model S-APEX Plaid from their 'Complete Vehicle'
 program, a program that offers bespoke Tesla vehicles tailored to individual preferences and style. With options ranging from exterior colors, interior materials, suspension setups and special features, each car is transformed into a high-performance, high-luxury experience. 
 
As a true testament to innovation and relentless pursuit of excellence, the S-APEX is a culmination of cutting-edge technology and performance enhancements, setting new standards for the high-performance electric vehicle industry. S-APEX builds start life as a Tesla Model S Plaid and enhance form and function through extensive aerodynamic, braking, suspension and luxury modifications to bring a comprehensive hypercar-like experience to the Plaid's 1,020 hp and 1,050 lb-ft of torque hypercar-like powertrain.  
 
Ben Schaffer, CEO of Unplugged Performance, expressed his excitement about the latest S-APEX, stating, ""With Dark Knight, we've set out to create the ultimate daily driven supercar. It showcases our commitment to pushing the boundaries of Tesla's capabilities and resonates with enthusiasts who value both raw speed and environmental consciousness. With its supercar-level presence and power, combined with the versatility of a family sedan, it's the best all-in-one car I've ever experienced.""
 
 
As with all S-APEX cars, the highlight of Dark Knight's exterior lies in the extensive carbon fiber features that bring an aggressive stance and allow for wider tires to maximize on-road and on-track performance. Unplugged Performance has redefined the limits of design and engineering by seamlessly integrating a 19-piece prepreg carbon fiber widebody kit that increases the width of the vehicle by 60mm and house 
21' lightweight UP-03 forged monoblock wheels
. The carbon fiber rocker panels include an integrated aerodynamic bargeboard aft the front wheels to improve aerodynamic airflow.
 
Unplugged Performance partnered with Koenigsegg Advanced Manufacturing to manage rear end downforce with a 
carbon fiber rear longtail spoiler
 made on the same production line as the carbon fiber parts on Koenigsegg's hypercars. Balancing downforce and effectively reducing lift at the front end of Dark Knight is an Unplugged Performance 
Autobahn front carbon fiber diffuser
, a first for an S-APEX build. Wrapping up the build is a sleek satin black finish exterior with exposed bits of its carbon fiber body.
 
 
Pairing the Model S-APEX driving experience to the hypercar speed of the Plaid comes in the form of improved suspension and braking components. Increasing grip and cornering speeds comes from the inclusion of a variety of Unplugged Performance suspension parts including their 
Sports Dynamic Lowering kit
, 
adjustable rear sway bar
, and an extensive list of billet aluminum 
adjustable control arms
 that increase strength and allow for precise alignment adjustments to front and rear toe, 
camber
 and caster. Stopping Dark Knight comes from Unplugged Performance 
carbon ceramic brakes
 at all four corners, and another first for an S-APEX, a 
carbon fiber brake cooling duct system
 that includes sleek block-off plates for non-spirited driving.
 
Inside Dark Knight, luxury meets sustainability with a custom interior designed through a unique and exclusive 
collaboration with von Holzhausen
. Utilizing their Banbū vegan leather in striking Serrano red across the seats, door panels, console and dashboard, it epitomizes Unplugged Performance's commitment to eco-conscious luxury.
 
 
Unplugged Performance's Model S-APEX Dark Knight reinforces their mission to cater to Tesla enthusiasts, delivering an unparalleled drive uniting power, sustainability, and individuality. By reshaping design and engineering benchmarks, Unplugged Performance reaffirms their role as Tesla upgrades' pioneers.  For those yearning to redefine their Tesla journey, Unplugged Performance's Model S-APEX can be ordered through their Complete Vehicle program which starts with a comprehensive consulting session to ensure the outcome of personalization is achieved.

SHANGHAI -- The 2 millionth vehicle produced by Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai rolled off the assembly line on Wednesday, reaching a new milestone, the company said.

In January 2019, Tesla's Shanghai plant, the carmaker's first gigafactory outside the United States, began construction, and turned out the first vehicle in December of that year.

The Shanghai factory produced its first 1 million cars in over 30 months, while achieving its second 1 million vehicles in less than 13 months, according to the company.

""The increase in Tesla's production speed is inseparable from the superior business environment in Shanghai, especially the Lin-gang special area of the Shanghai pilot free trade zone,"" said Song Gang, senior director of manufacturing at Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai.

In the first eight months of this year, Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai delivered more than 600,000 vehicles, exceeding the total number achieved in 2021. It has become a global export hub for Tesla, whose cars now sell well in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202309/06/64f8283ca310d2dc6d27574a.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,8.237967,554b42c334055c18b6ea9a0f9f4d876d

The industry-wide shift towards electric vehicles will be front and center at this week's fair, with Chinese carmakers out in force as they eye the European market.
U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla, owned by Elon Musk, will return to the IAA for the first time since 2013 and is expected to unveil a revamped version of its mass-market Model 3.
That Tesla, usually a holdout at such events, is coming to Munich shows it is taking the growing competition seriously, said Jan Burgard from the Berylls automotive consulting group. ""The electric car market with its many new players will be divvied up over the next few years and people want to know: who is offering what?"" Burgard told the Handelsblatt financial daily.
Having captured an increasingly large part of the prized Chinese market, Chinese upstarts are now hoping to win over European customers with cheaper electric cars. Chinese manufacturers are starting ""their assault on Europe with the IAA"", said industry analyst Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer from the Center Automotive Research in Germany.

◆ Muted European Presence
Chinese groups benefit from lower production costs, allowing them to offer cut-throat prices at a time when entry-level EVs are still a rarity.
Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kallenius said it was necessary for European firms to stay competitive in the face of stiff competition. ""Don't make it worse. Don't start a debate that we should work less hours at the same pay, those types of things. That would be going the wrong direction,"" Kallenius told reporters at the IAA on Sunday.
Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume meanwhile said he was ""impressed"" by the speed at which China had advanced its electric car technology. He added that it was ""crucial"" for VW to succeed in China's domestic EV market -- where it is currently lagging far behind China's BYD and Tesla. ""The more electric cars we have, the more we can benefit from economies of scale,"" Blume said.
In all, 41 percent of exhibitors at the industry fair have their headquarters in China, including brands such as BYD, Leapmotor and Geely.
Contrary to the Asian onslaught, participation from European carmakers at the IAA will be muted. Germany's homegrown champions Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz will be joined by Renault from France, but the 14-brand Stellantis Group will only be represented by Opel.
BMW presented its ""Neue Klasse"" (New Class) generation of electric cars in Munich on Saturday, a series of six vehicles that will be manufactured from 2025. European automakers are investing heavily in the switch towards zero-emission driving as the European Union aims to end the sale of polluting combustion engine cars by 2035.
The historic transition comes at a challenging time. While the supply chain problems caused by the pandemic have eased, surging energy prices in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine and a weaker global economy are weighing on European manufacturers.
Although car sales in the EU have steadily improved over the last 12 months, they remain around 20 percent below their pre-pandemic levels as inflation and higher interest rates dampen appetites for new vehicles.
Some 700,000 visitors are expected to attend this week's IAA. Climate groups have vowed to stage protests, including acts of ""civil disobedience"" aimed at disrupting the fair.
On Monday morning, Greenpeace activists submerged three cars in a small lake outside the convention center. ""The car industry continues to rely on too many cars, that are too big and too heavy.

His biographer says he's working on one that looks a lot like the Cybertruck.","The 
Tesla Cybertruck
. 
Tesla
 
 
 
Despite years of promises, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hasn't always prioritized the 
game-changing $25,000 electric car.
 
Musk has instead been hung up on developing an all-new robotaxi, Walter Isaacson, Musk's biographer, 
shared in an excerpt of his upcoming book with Axios
 — but company executives have since convinced Musk to prioritize both that and the inexpensive EV.
 
The Tesla chief told company executives in November 2021 that someday, he'd want to build ""20 million"" self-driving robotaxis annually and 
predicted owners would earn upwards of $30,000 a year giving driverless rides to others
, Axios reported.
 
For over a year, Musk wanted these robotaxis to forgo mirrors, pedals, and steering wheels despite protests from his leadership team and concerns over whether Tesla's Full Self-Driving tech would be ready.
 
Eventually, those executives set Musk on track to build both the robotaxi and the affordable EV offering under the premise they could share the same assembly lines, according to Axios' recount.
 
In a design review session earlier this year, mockups of both the robotaxi and the $25,000 EV had a 
futuristic design not unlike the long-awaited Cybertruck
.
 
Back-and-forth promises
 
But Musk has a 
complicated history regarding his promises about building a $25,000 EV.
 In Tesla's early days, Musk's first Master Plan was to use money earned from more expensive models like the Roadster and 
Model S
 to fund cheaper ones, according to Axios. The 
Model 3
 was intended to be Tesla's most affordable option, but it debuted at $52,000 instead of the initially anticipated $35,000, Axios reported.
 
In 2018, Musk said 
it would take his company about three years to get to $25,000
. In 
2020, he again promised an EV at that price
 — this time, one that was fully autonomous — in another three years' time.
 
By early 2022, 
Musk told investors that the company wasn't actually working on it
. He said at the time Tesla had too many other things on its plate, including a humanoid 
robot
.
 
That wavering has paved the way for other EV makers to race to meet that target price point. 
Electric cars have largely, on average, been more costly upfront
 than internal combustion engine ones, 
one major barrier to widespread adoption for many consumers
. In July, EVs saw an average transaction price of $53,469, according to Kelley Blue Book, down significantly from $65,108 a year earlier, though higher than the $48,334 average for vehicles overall.
 
EV prices are coming down as 
automakers scale
, and 
there are some affordable plug-in models out there
 — not to mention, the 
used EV market is starting to take off
 — but it's still top of mind for many to reach the coveted $25,000 mark. EV affordability is becoming more and more crucial as the 
industry shifts from selling to early adopters to targeting a less enthusiastic
 wave of buyers.
 
Tesla rival 
Lucid has discussed similar plans as Tesla to scale enough in order to bring costs down for buyers
. 
Volkswagen
 unveiled a close contender, the 
roughly $26,000 ID.2all concept
, but that won't ever make its way to the US.
 
More recently, experts said 
Tesla's plans to build in Mexico could be its golden ticket to bringing a $25,000 car
 to the masses.

""EV models the company will launch in North America before 2025, which will be equipped with a Combined Charging System (CCS) port, are also being developed to be compatible with the NACS through the use of a charging adaptor,"" Honda said.

In North America, Honda recently announced that it has agreed to establish a joint venture among seven automakers to build a high-powered charging network for EVs with the aim of building a reliable charging infrastructure.

Ford and General Motors announced similar deals with Tesla in June, and electric truck maker Rivian followed suit later that month.

European carmaker Volvo also signed an agreement with Tesla in June to provide current and future electric Volvo car drivers access to 12,000 Tesla's vast Supercharger network across the US, Canada and Mexico.

In February, theadministration revealed new initiatives to install 5,00,000 electric vehicle chargers onroads by 2030 under its $7.5 billion plan, and as part of it, Tesla has committed to opening up 7,500 of its charging stations to non-Tesla vehicles by the end of 2024.

A landlord of a local pub, Matt Grigg, told the newspaper that the police were at the scene for several hours and that the Tesla couldn't be started despite it showing it still had charge remaining. 
 
Grigg added that the vehicle caused an obstruction and delays throughout the day before it could be moved to his pub to get charged.
 
In May, a Tesla broke down in a McDonald's drive-thru in Ottawa, Canada and a TikTok user 
shared a clip
 of the motionless vehicle.
 
""So the Tesla died in the parking lot of the McDonalds drive-thru. They can't push it out because they can't put it in gear,"" she said in the video, which has been viewed about two million times. 
 
Another 
Tesla owner
 got locked out of his 
Model S
 in September last year after the 
battery
 died. Mario Zelaya said in a TikTok video that 
he couldn't get inside
 and that it wouldn't charge. At the time he said Tesla told him it would cost more than $20,000 to 
repair

What sealed the deal for Elon Musk to greenlight the production of Tesla's cheapest car, dubbed the Model 2, was its design. 'When one of these comes around a corner, people will think they are seeing something from the future,' he reportedly quipped.
E-Mobility






The upcoming book on Elon Musk by the resident writer of such magnum opuses Walter Isaacson (of Steve Jobs biography fame) is a gift that keeps on giving when it comes to revealing Tesla's plans, past and future. The latest excerpt talks about the team's musings how to proceed with the autonomous 
robotaxi
 and its less ambitious spinoff, the 
Model 2
 mass market electric car. 


Apparently, Elon Musk only warmed up to the idea of a sub-US$25,000 car this February when he was served its design drawings next to the robotaxi. ""
When one of these comes around a corner, people will think they are seeing something from the future
,"" he reportedly said, indicating that what he has been looking for is a convention-busting design that will be as trailblazing as the one of the Cybertruck. 


Previously, the report says, he has been adamant that Tesla's first mass market electric vehicle should be the long-teased robotaxi with no steering wheel, pedals, or mirrors. He was reportedly very excited about its potential and said with his characteristic visionary zeal that the robotaxi ""
is the product that makes Tesla a ten-trillion company
"" so ""
people will be talking about this moment in a hundred years
."" 


It was Tesla's design head Franz von Holzhausen who had to inventively bring Elon Musk back to earth by drafting a futuristic design for both the Model 2, and the robotaxi. ""
If we go down a path of having no steering wheel, and FSD is not ready, we won't be able to put them on the road
,"" he allegedly told Musk, and got a sharp rebuttal from Tesla's CEO:
Let me be clear. This vehicle must be designed as a clean robotaxi. We're going to take that risk. It's my fault if it f--ks up. But we are not going to design some sort of amphibian frog that's a halfway car. We are all in on autonomy.
Last September, the team's knowledge of Elon Musk's character helped them arrive at a solution that will see both EVs built at once. The ""
next-gen vehicle platform
"" that will be assembled at the new 
Gigafactory in Mexico
 would allow the Model 2 and the robotaxi to be built at the same assembly lines in a highly automated, fast production process. 


What sealed the deal for Elon Musk, however, besides the excitement around creating a brand new manufacturing process for mass market EVs from scratch, was the Model 2's design. While it is still not clear how Tesla's cheapest car will look like, there have been some hints. Earlier this year, insiders claimed that it will resemble a 
smaller Model Y
, suggesting a 5-door hatch of sorts, rather than a more compact sedan. 


There have been some other hints in the form of mysterious Tesla hatch 
sketches
, too. When Elon Musk announced the launch of Tesla's Engineering HQ in Palo Alto, the promo video showed a drawing board with various Tesla designs, including versions of the hatchback form factor that Tesla previously 
teased
 in job listings. 


Whether that's the design that Elon Musk deemed futuristic enough, remains to be seen, but given what Tesla did with the Cybertruck, the final Model 2 body shape could be more unorthodox than what's seen on the sketches here.

IDH mutations confer neomorphic activity leading to the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical potential of proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in identifying IDH-mutant gliomas by detecting characteristic resonances of 2HG and its complex interplay with other clinically relevant metabolites. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two patients with suspected infiltrative glioma underwent a single-voxel (SVS, n = 17) and/or single-slice-multivoxel (1H-MRSI, n = 15) proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) sequence with an optimized echo-time (97 ms) on 3T-MRI. Spectroscopy data were analyzed using the linear combination (LC) model. Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) values of <40% were considered acceptable for detecting 2HG and <20% for other metabolites. Immunohistochemical analyses for determining IDH mutational status were subsequently performed from resected tumor specimens and findings were compared with the results from spectral data. Mann–Whitney and chi-squared tests were performed to ascertain differences in metabolite levels between IDH-mutant and IDH-wild-type gliomas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were also performed. Results: Data from eight cases were excluded due to poor spectral quality or non-tumor-related etiology, and final data analyses were performed from 24 cases. Of these cases, 9/12 (75%) were correctly identified as IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype gliomas through SVS and 10/12 (83%) through 1H-MRSI with an overall concordance rate of 79% (19/24). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80%, 77%, 86%, and 70%, respectively. The metabolite 2HG was found to be significant in predicting IDH-mutant gliomas through the chi-squared test (p < 0.01). The IDH-mutant gliomas also had a significantly higher NAA/Cr ratio (1.20 ± 0.09 vs. 0.75 ± 0.12 p = 0.016) and lower Glx/Cr ratio (0.86 ± 0.078 vs. 1.88 ± 0.66; p = 0.029) than those with IDH wild-type gliomas. The areas under the ROC curves for NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr were 0.808 and 0.786, respectively. Conclusions: Noninvasive optimized 1H-MRS may be useful in predicting IDH mutational status and 2HG may serve as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in patients with gliomas",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"De Godoy,Donald M.,Hanaoka,Kheng Choon,Laiz Laura,Laiz Laura de Godoy,Lee,Lim,O Rourke,Rajan,Verma",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/cancers/cancers-15-04453/article_deploy/html/images/cancers-15-04453-g001-550.jpg?1694075321,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,5.2404304,d8d807981f4a242ca4317e6266255d31

Tesla got an upgrade from Morgan Stanley that called out the Dojo supercomputer as a $500 billion wild card.



Dojo sets the company up as a software and service provider for computer vision and AI companies.



The UAW strike is a hidden opportunity for this non-union company, which is ramping up production.

5 stocks we like better than Tesla

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is going all-in on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) . The firm raised its rating on the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and set a new price target. The new target is $400 and the new high-price target among analysts. It is a 60% increase from Morgan Stanley's previtarget and 60% above the recent price action, so why?



Find A Qualified Financial Advisor

Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to 3 fiduciary financial advisors in your area in 5 minutes .

Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests.

If you're ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now .

The reason is Tesla's position in the AI market. Analyst Adam Jonas calls the company's Dojo supercompute a $500 billion wild card and likens it to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) opportunity with AWS. In his view, the company's future includes software and services, fixed-price car sales, and power delivery.



What is Dojo? Dojo is Elon Musk's answer to the tight supply of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU superclusters. To paraphrase, the company says it can't get enough of them to train their cars, so they made their own system. Dojo is a computer-vision-focused AI supercomputer that aggregates imagery from Tesla vehicles. Dojo uses the data to train the company's machine-learning models for full self-driving vehicles.

Like most of Musk does, the Dojo architecture is unlike what others are doing and may lead to the next significant advance in AI technology.



The analysts' activity in Tesla has been mixed this year but now shows a turning point for the market. The consenprice target and rating are down compared to last year, but the price target, at least, is trending higher verlast month and last quarter, and the Morgan Stanley upgrade is a step in the right direction.



The Morgan Stanley upgrade is the 1st since June and is offset by 3 downgrades in the same period, but even those aren't as bearish as they could be. Two of the 3 downgrades are still Holding and see the stock fairly valued near $260. Aside from that, Tesla stock has seen a series of price target increases that have it trading well above the current consensus.



Recent data from China may lead analysts to continue raising their price targets this year. China's Passenger Car Association said that August sales hit a record for the month and were led by EVs and hybrids. As increasing competition cuts into growth, EV and hybrid sales grew by 35%, and Tesla sales by 31% compared to the prior month.



The takeaway is that the analysts, as robust as the targets for Q3 are, may be underestimating TSLA growth. They expect revenue to be flat compared to the prior quarter, which the data from China contradicts. Assuming the company posts similarly strong results in other markets, Q3 revenue should grow sequentially, even with the recent cuts in pricing.



The looming autoworkers strike is a potential catalyst for Tesla and its share prices. Tesla is the only major OEM not represented by the unions and stands to gain ground against its competitors. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush views the strike as the worst in 50 years and 1 that could set back plans for the Big 3 automakers' EV transition.



Along with the prospect of losing time and pushing the timeline for EV production ramps into 2024, the strike could eliminate any pricing advantages the Big 3 automakers have. Not only does the UAW want more pay, but it also wants shorter work weeks and other high-cost concessions that will cut into automakers' profits. Meanwhile, Tesla will continue to ramp production at its Gigafactories.



Tesla's stock price shot up more than 6.0% on the Morgan Stanley upgrade, and it may move higher. The advance shows support at the long-term 150-day EMA, a critical support level. Assuming the market follows through on this signal, the next target for resistance is near $280. A move above there would be bullish and open the door to a move up to $300. Beyond that, it will come down to the next earnings report. Tesla is slated to report in mid-October, and the bar is low.

566,Gigacasting 2.0: Tesla looks to diecast nearly the entire underbody in one piece,Reuters,2023-09-16 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/09/16/gigacasting-tesla-looks-to-diecast-nearly-the-entire-underbody-in-one-piece/,autoblog.com,Tesla has combined a series of innovations to make a technological breakthrough that could transform the way it makes electric vehicles and help Elon Musk a,"Tesla
 has combined a series of innovations to make a technological breakthrough that could transform the way it makes 
electric vehicles
 and help 
Elon Musk
 achieve his aim of halving production costs, five people familiar with the move said. 
 
The company pioneered the use of huge presses with 6,000 to 9,000 tons of clamping pressure to mold the front and rear structures of its 
Model Y
 in a ""gigacasting"" process that slashed production costs and left rivals scrambling to catch up. 
 
In a bid to extend its lead, Tesla is closing in on an innovation that would allow it to die cast nearly all the complex underbody of an EV in one piece, rather than about 400 parts in a conventional car, the people said. 
 
The know-how is core to Tesla's ""unboxed"" manufacturing strategy unveiled by Chief Executive Musk in March, a linchpin of his plan to churn out tens of millions of cheaper EVs in the coming decade, and still make a profit, the sources said. 
 
While Tesla has said its unboxed model involves producing large sub-assemblies of a car at the same time and then snapping them together, the size and make-up of the modular blocks is still the subject of speculation. 
 
Terry Woychowski, president of U.S. engineering company Caresoft Global, said if Tesla managed to gigacast most of the underbody of an EV, it would further disrupt the way cars are designed and manufactured. 
 
""It is an enabler on steroids. It has a huge implication for the industry, but it's a very challenging task,"" said Woychowski, who worked for U.S. automaker 
GM
 for more than three decades. ""Castings are very hard to do, especially the bigger and the more complicated."" 
 
Two of the sources said Tesla's previously unreported new design and manufacturing techniques meant the company could develop a car from the ground up in 18 to 24 months, while most rivals can currently take anywhere from three to four years. 
 
The five people said a single large frame - combining the front and rear sections with the middle underbody where the 
battery
 is housed - could be used in Tesla's small EV which it aims to launch with a price tag of $25,000 by the middle of the decade. 
 
Tesla was expected to make a decision on whether to die cast the platform in one piece as soon as this month, three of the sources said, though even if they do press ahead the end product could change during the design validation process. 
 
Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to questions from Reuters for this story. 
 
3D printing and sand
 
The breakthrough Tesla has made centres on the how the giant molds for such a large part are designed and tested for mass production, and how casts can incorporate hollow subframes with internal ribs to cut weight and boost crashworthiness. 
 
In both cases the innovations, developed by design and casting specialists in Britain, Germany, 
Japan
 and the United States, involve 3D printing and industrial sand, the five people said. All spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media. 
 
So far, automakers have shied away from casting ever-bigger structures because of the ""gigacast dilemma"": creating molds to make parts of 1.5 metres squared or more boosts efficiency but is expensive and comes with myriad risks. 
 
Once a large metal test mold has been made, machining tweaks during the design process could cost $100,000 a go, or redoing the mold altogether might come to $1.5 million, according to one casting specialist. Another said the whole design process for a large metal mold would typically cost about $4 million. 
 
That has been deemed prohibitive by automakers - especially as a design might need half a dozen tweaks or more to achieve a perfect die from the perspective of noise and vibration, fit and finish, ergonomics and crashworthiness, the sources said. 
 
But Musk's vision from the start was to find a way to cast the underbody in one piece, despite the risks, the sources said. 
 
To overcome the obstacles, Tesla turned to firms that make test molds out of industrial sand with 3D printers. Using a digital design file, printers known as binder jets deposit a liquid binding agent onto a thin layer of sand and gradually build a mold, layer by layer, that can die cast molten alloys. 
 
According to one source, the cost of the design validation process with sand casting, even with multiple versions, is minimal - just 3% of doing the same with a metal prototype. 
 
That means Tesla can tweak prototypes as many times as needed, reprinting a new one in a matter of hours using machines from companies such as Desktop Metal and its unit ExOne. 
 
The design validation cycle using sand casting only takes to two to three months, two of the sources said, compared with anywhere from six months to a year for metal mold prototypes. 
 
Tailor-made alloys
 
The subframes in a car underbody are typically hollow to save weight and improve crashworthiness. At the moment, they are made by stamping and welding multiple parts together leaving a void in the middle. 
 
To cast subframes with hollows as part of one gigacasting, Tesla plans to place solid sand cores printed by the binder jets within the overall mold. Once the part has been cast, the sand is removed to leave the voids. 
 
But despite that greater flexibility achieved in both the design process and the complexity of the large frames, there was still one more major hurdle to clear. 
 
The aluminium alloys used to produce the castings behaved differently in sand and metal molds and often failed to meet Tesla's criteria for crashworthiness and other attributes. 
 
The casting specialists overcame that by formulating special alloys, fine-tuning the molten alloy cooling process, and also coming up with an after-production heat treatment, three of the sources said. And once Tesla is happy with the prototype mold, it can then invest in a final metal one for mass production. 
 
The sources said Tesla's upcoming small car has given it a perfect opportunity to cast an EV platform in one piece, mainly because its underbody is simpler, 
 
The kind of small cars Tesla is developing – one for personal use and the other a robotaxi – don't have a big ""overhang"" at the front and the back, as there is not much of a hood or rear trunk. 
 
""It's like a boat in a way, a battery tray with small wings attached to both ends. That would make sense to do in one piece,"" one person said. 
 
The sources said, however, that Tesla still had to make a call on what kind of gigapress to use if it decides to cast the underbody in one piece - and that choice would also dictate how complex the car frame would be. 
 
To punch out such large body parts fast, the people said Tesla would need new bigger gigapresses with massive clamping power of 16,000 tons or more, which would come with a hefty price tag and might need larger factory buildings. 
 
Three of the five sources said one problem with presses using high clamping power, however, was that they cannot house the 3D printed sand cores needed to make hollow subframes. 
 
The people said Tesla could solve these obstacles by using a different type of press into which molten alloy can be injected slowly - a method that tends to produce higher quality castings and can accommodate the sand cores. 
 
But the process takes longer. 
 
""Tesla could still choose high-pressure for productivity, or they could choose slow alloy injection for quality and versatility,"" one of the people said. ""It's still a coin toss at this point."" ",autoblog.com,1835,news,GB,en,Reuters,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/63477830-198f-11ee-b1f7-e8cfb91eefdd,False,@therealautoblog,7.545691,5c34428b2d662b0780e3d7402f32c276

to convince him to pursue an affordable car as well, however, the CEO only relented when his aides revealed a plan to build both the $25,000 car and

Tesla's robotaxi side by side, reports Teslarati.

The news was first reported by Axios.

Tesla plans to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030.

To accomplish this, the company would require a vehicle that could be built quickly and at scale, meaning Tesla requires a vehicle with far greater output than the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Tesla's next-generation platform, which was discussed earlier this year at Investor Day, appears to be designed for this purpose, the report said.

As per Isaacson, Musk had a brainstorming session in November 2021 with his top five lieutenants in Austin, discussing a basic robotaxi that could be

produced in high volumes.

According to the report, Musk and his team spent almost a year debating whether to build a car with traditional controls or a vehicle that is fully autonomous, with no steering wheel or pedals, which would require taking a greater risk.

A number of Tesla engineers reportedly pushed for a more conservative approach.

During a meeting on August 18, 2022, Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen even suggested that the robotaxi could be a vehicle with steering wheels and pedals that could be removed later.

Musk, however, was reportedly adamant.

Following a meeting in September 2022, von Holzhausen and several others presented data to Musk showing that a small,'global car' would be needed

for Tesla to achieve its ambitigrowth targets.

The team convinced the CEO that both the $25,000 car and the robotaxi could be built on the same next-generation platform. Both vehicles could be

produced using the same assembly lines as well, the report mentioned.

Musk was ultimately convinced by von Holzhausen's use of the $25,000 Tesla and robotaxi model alongside each other in Tesla's Design Studio.

Goyal also highlighted that Tesla had already sourced components worth $1 billion from India in the previous year.
Goyal's statement comes amid Tesla's keen interest in the Indian market, with the company engaging in talks with the government about establishing a manufacturing facility for affordable electric vehicles (EVs). 
""Tesla last year already bought $1 billion worth of components from India... this year their target is $1.7-$1.9 billion,"" Piyush Goyal said at an auto conference, according to the news agency. 
""I am convinced that this (EVs) is the future. It is something we must try to attract,"" he added. 
The shift in Tesla's strategy reflects a willingness to manufacture locally in the country, overcoming previous hurdles related to import taxes on EVs. The company's executives visited India in May, initiating talks about setting up manufacturing facilities for both vehicles and batteries. 
It may be noted that high-level meetings were held between Tesla and the commerce minister after Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June, during which Musk expressed his intent to make substantial investments in India.
In 2021, Tesla initially sought entry into the Indian market by advocating for a reduction in the 100 per cent import tax imposed on electric vehicles (EVs). However, negotiations between Tesla and Indian authorities faltered when officials indicated that the company needed to commit to local manufacturing before proceeding.
In a notable change of strategy, Tesla has since expressed its eagerness to establish a domestic manufacturing facility. The company aims to 
produce a new EV with a price tag of approximately Rs 20 lakh
, making it approximately 25 per cent more affordable than its current entry-level model.
This move is intended to cater to both the Indian market and facilitate exports. However, the government has made it clear that it is 
not considering any tax waivers for Tesla

An excerpt of an upcoming biography of 
Elon Musk
 sheds light on what Musk and Bill Gates thought of each other following a negative exchange over Gates taking a short position against Musk's Tesla.
 
In early 2022, Gates was chatting to Musk about philanthropy, having proposed that Musk donate to refugees, American education, finding a cure for AIDS, mosquito eradication, and climate-resistant seeds, according to Walter Isaacson, a writer who spent three years trailing the Tesla CEO.
 
Isaacson detailed Gates' and Musk's encounter in his forthcoming biography, ""Elon Musk."" The 
book
 is set to be published on September 12. 
CNBC
 ran an excerpt of the biography on Sunday.
 
After their initial chat, when Gates followed up with Musk again in April via text, Musk shot back: ""Sorry. I cannot take your philanthropy on climate seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve 
climate change
.""
 
Shorting a stock means an investor is betting on its value to drop. Musk claimed in April 2022 that Gates had 
taken a half-billion dollar short
 position against Tesla.
 
Speaking about this incident to Isaacson, Gates told the writer he even apologized to Musk. 
 
""Once he heard I'd shorted the stock, he was super mean to me, but he's super mean to so many people, so you can't take it too personally,"" Gates told Isaacson. 
 
Gates also told Isaacson his decision was a business move, as he anticipated the supply of 
electric vehicles
 would soon outpace demand, leading to a price drop.
 
The full text exchange between Musk and Gates — which Isaacson recounts in the biography — was first leaked online in April 2022. Musk 
confirmed its authenticity
 on Twitter.
 
 
 —Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) 
April 22, 2022
 
 
 
Explaining how he heard of the short, 
Musk tweeted:
 ""I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it's not exactly top secret.""
 
That same month, Musk later took a jab at Gates 
about his weight
 on Twitter, before eventually declaring that he was 
""moving on""
 from the issue.
 
To put the stakes of their philanthropy discussion in context, Gates and Musk were two of the 
biggest charitable donors in 2022
 by the size of their donations, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
 
In 2022 alone, Gates contributed $5 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was the largest single donation that year. Meanwhile, Musk donated $1.9 billion in Tesla stock in 2022, making him the second largest donor that year, behind Gates and ahead of Michael Bloomberg, per the Chronicle.
 
Gates and Musk did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, sent outside regular business hours.

? Just get a friend to buy one before the end of the month.
 
That's the promotion 
Elon Musk's car company
 is offering its fans in an apparent effort to boost sales as the third quarter comes to a close at the end of September.
 
Tesla runs a loyalty program whereby owners get a unique referral code they can share with friends. When someone buys their first Tesla with that code, both the buyer and the referrer get perks of some kind. Referrers can rack up credits this way, which they can spend on things like software upgrades and free Supercharger visits.
 
Tesla on Tuesday introduced a new referral benefit for US customers. Owners who get a friend to buy and take delivery of a new Tesla between September 19 and September 30 will be 
automatically entered for a chance to win a Model 3 Performance
, which costs $53,240.
 
Owners can also buy entries in the sweepstakes for 1,000 credits a pop.
 
Lately, Tesla has run limited-time promotions to juice sales
 as a quarter comes to a close. In the past, it's discounted vehicle prices and offered free Supercharging to buyers who act quickly. Musk has also been known to send company-wide emails during the end-of-quarter push urging employees to put the pedal to the metal.
 
Tesla significantly pared back the referral program in recent years after 
saying it was too expensive to the company
. This year, it revamped and expanded the program as it looks to sell more cars at lower profit margins.
 
Credits can also buy Tesla fans a factory tour or an entry to win a futuristic

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged tech tycoon Elon Musk to open his next Tesla factory in Turkey, becoming the latest leader to lobby one of the world's richest men.

Erdogan and Musk have held a series of meetings both in Turkey and on the sidelines of international forums, developing a seeming friendship that they extended on Sunday in New York.

Turkish television on Monday showed Musk entering New York's Turkish House, a new skyscraper across from the United Nations building, with his son, whom he held on his lap during the talks.

""President Erdogan called on Tesla to establish its seventh factory in Turkey,"" the Turkish leader's office said.

Turkey's Anadolu state news agency said Musk told Erdogan that his country was ""among the most important candidates"" for the new factory.

Erdogan's lobbying efforts follow those undertaken by French President Emmanuel Macron, who met Musk in June, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

Erdogan was in New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly meeting, which he is scheduled to address on Tuesday.

Tesla currently has six factories, including two outside the United States -- one in Shanghai focused on the Asian market and a second focused on European sales near Berlin.

It is also building one in Mexico, and has tentative plans for a plant in India.

Erdogan likes to promote Turkey's high-tech sector, which is arguably most famous for its Bayraktar combat drones.

The drones, which helped Ukraine repel Russia's march on Kyiv in the first weeks of its invasion last year, featured prominently during Erdogan's May re-election campaign.

Turkey this year also unveiled its first domestically-made electric vehicle, called Togg, which requires a constant stream of electric batteries and parts.

Musk's SpaceX has also been working with Turkey's space industry, launching some of its communication satellites.

Erdogan's office said he invited Musk to attend Teknofest, a technology fair scheduled for later this month in Turkey's western city of Izmir.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/18/AFP_6b1c9image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.841553,dcb4cb5be8c6db597a552509bd9d794d

The news follows earlier reports that the EV maker was discussing the construction of an EV factory in the country. The proposed factory would have an annual capacity of half a million electric vehicles.

These vehicles will be low-cost models, with a price tag of some $24,000, Reuters noted in its latest report.

Initially, Tesla had plans to set up shop in India last year but scrapped those plans when the Modi government refused to lower import taxes on cars-these taxes in some cases reach 100%, which would make Teslas prohibitively expensive. The idea of the government was to motivate Tesla to manufacture cars locally rather than import them.

The Indian government has poured some $3.2 billion in the form of incentives for the industry, CNBC reported earlier this year, attracting $8.3 billion in investment. Some of the world's biggest carmakers including VW, Volvo Cars, and Stellantis, are also venturing into the EV market on the subcontinent.

It seems this has worked for the EVs, at least. According to the Reuters source, subsidies for battery storage systems production will not be forthcoming. On the other hand, New Delhi could incentivize Tesla to go ahead with the project by offering subsidies to the future buyers of those systems.

Tesla is the maker of the Powerwall storage systems that can store energy from a solar installation or from the grid for use during the dark hours of the day or during outages.

It appears, based on these reports, that India is a key expansion target for Tesla. Per the Reuters sources, the company is eyeing a market not only for its residential battery storage systems but for its industrial offering, as well. Earlier reports cited more sources as saying Tesla was viewing the subcontinent as an export hub for the Indo-Pacific region.

During their discussion, President Erdogan expounded on Turkey's technological advancements, emphasizing Ankara's notable achievements in the realms of technology, the ""Digital Turkey"" vision, and the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy. The country's commitment to technological innovation and progress was a central point of Erdogan's message.



In addition to advocating for Turkey as the preferred site for Tesla's next factory, President Erdogan also explored potential collaboration opportunities with SpaceX, another company led by Elon Musk. He expressed optimism that such opportunities could arise within the context of Turkey's ambitious space program, highlighting Turkey's aspirations in the field of aerospace.

Powerwall is an integrated battery system that stores solar energy for backup protection when the grid goes down.

The system detects outages, powers your home and electric vehicle with backup energy and automatically recharges with sunlight to keep appliances running for days.

The government may help Tesla create a ""fair business model for the company by offering subsidies to those purchasing such products"", the report mentioned.

According to Tesla, Powerwall is a compact home battery that reduces your reliance on the grid by storing your solar energy for use when the sun isn't shining.

""You can add additional Powerwall units to your system to reduce your impact further and better prepare your home for power outages,"" it says.

Musk is finally aiming to build a Tesla supply system in India. The electric vehicle major is planning to source automobile parts worth up to $1.9 billion this year from India, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said this month.

The imports will be around double as compared to auto parts worth $1 billion imported by Tesla from India last year, Goyal said while addressing the annual convention of Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA). The minister said that last year, Tesla had already bought $1 billion worth of components from India and this year their target is $1.7-$1.9 billion.

Goyal's statement came after reports said that the Musk-led company has held talks with the government, and is exploring the possibility of bringing its auto parts and electronics chain to the country.

Shorting a stock is a bearish bet that a company's share price will decline over a specific period, often within a one-to-six-month timeframe.

Short sellers are currently betting $22 billion U.S. that Tesla's stock price will move lower, according to data from S3 Partners. Almost 3% of Tesla's stock is currently sold short.

The bets against Tesla are nearly 10 times greater than the second most heavily shorted vehicle stock, Rivian Automotive (RIVN).

Ford Motor Co. (F) is the third most heavily shorted vehicle stock on Wall Street with $1.9 billion U.S. bets against its share price.

The high valuation of Tesla's stock makes it a popular target among short sellers. Tesla's shares currently trade at 58 times forecasted 2024 earnings.

The average stock listed in the benchmark S&P 500 index trades for about 18.4 times future earnings estimates.

The report on automotive stocks comes as the big three U.S. vehicle manufacturers, Ford, General Motor (GM), and Stellantis (STLA) endure a strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW).

Tesla
 and the 
Bugatti
 offer massive amounts of horsepower and speed — but one is gas-powered and one is electric. 
Bugatti, Tesla
 
 
 
An enduringly strange element of the rise of 
electric vehicles
 is that previously rare levels of performance are now commonplace.
 
Since electric motors can provide immense amounts of power at any speed, neck-snapping quickness that used to be reserved for the most coveted 
Porsches
, 
Ferraris
, and 
Lamborghinis
 is now available in 
Teslas
, 
Kias
, and 
BMWs
 of all shapes and sizes.
 
This bizarre trend was perfectly encapsulated in a recent 
YouTube video
 from the automotive marketplace Carwow. The channel pitted the sportiest Tesla you can buy — a four-door 
Model S
 Plaid with the optional Track Package — against the 
Bugatti Chiron
 Super Sport, a multimillion-dollar 
supercar
 from a brand synonymous with world-beating performance.
 
Spoiler alert: The Bugatti came out on top. As it should. But the results were closer than you might expect — especially given that 
the Model S
 will run you only a little over $100,000. I say ""only"" because the Chiron Super Sport would have cost at least $4 million when new.
 
Before we dive into the video, a little more about our contenders: the Model S Plaid offers 1,020 horsepower from two motors — one powering each axle.
 
The Chiron has a 16-cylinder, quad-turbocharged engine making 1,600 horsepower. A modified version of the Chiron, the Super Sport 300+, holds the title of the world's fastest production car, notching a top speed of 305 mph.
 
In the first test, a quarter-mile drag race, the Tesla led for quite a while — thanks to all that instantly available torque I mentioned earlier. But when the 
Tesla
 started to flag at high speeds, the Bugatti was just getting started. The Chiron surged past the Tesla to take the victory by a hair, with both cars finishing in 9.6 seconds.
 
It was a similar story in the next head-to-head, a half-mile race starting at 50 mph. The Tesla pulled away quicker initially, but at high speeds, it's no match for the Bugatti, which ripped from 120 mph to 210 mph without breaking a sweat.
 
It's wild that this is even a contest. Check out the full video below:

electric cars
 charge at a Supercharger. 
George Rose/Getty Images
 
 
 
After years of teasers, Tesla began opening up its 
vast, exclusive network of Superchargers
 to drivers of other electric vehicles in the US earlier this year.
 
There's just one kink that 
Elon Musk
 hasn't ironed out: The charging cables, which were designed for Teslas, aren't long enough to comfortably accommodate some other cars. It means non-Teslas have had to park awkwardly to plug in. Or worse yet, park in the wrong spot, blocking off two charging stalls instead of one. 
 
In March, Tesla opened a handful of its roughly 1,700 US charging stations to non-Tesla vehicles. It accomplished this rather elegantly, by retrofitting what it calls a ""Magic Dock,"" an adapter that automatically attaches to let 
Chevrolets
, 
Porsches
, 
BMWs
 top up. (Tesla designed its own charging connector, while the rest of the industry uses a different standard.)
 
 
 —PlugShare (@plugshare) 
March 2, 2023
 
 
 
EV owners flocked to the stations to test them out, with many marveling online at the seamless process. But they also noticed a glaring flaw in the plan. All Teslas have their charging in the same spot on the back-left corner of the car. Superchargers themselves — and the surrounding parking spots — are designed to accommodate Teslas only. 
 
That poses a problem when other electric cars, which may have their charging ports elsewhere, try to charge up. 
 
For example, when 
tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee
 
took his Rivian truck to a Tesla station
 in New York, he had to park in the wrong spot — effectively blocking another charging stall — in order to plug in. The same happened when Electrek, an electric-car blog, 
brought a Chevrolet Bolt
 to a Supercharger. 
 
In a 
recent YouTube video
, Dave Conner, of the automotive channel Out of Spec Reviews, charged a 
Genesis GV60
 electric SUV at a Tesla station while taking up two spots. He noted that the situation could pose problems, particularly during times when chargers are in high demand. 
 
""People are going to start to get upset here with the fact that Tesla has delivered this Magic Dock station capability, but they haven't thought through the logistics as far as how people are going to charge,"" Conner said. 
 
In 
a video on his State of Charge YouTube channel
, Tom Moloughney could barely get Tesla's cable to reach the charging port of his 
Ford F-150 Lightning
, but succeeded (while blocking an extra space) after repositioning his vehicle extremely close to a bollard in front of the parking space. He spoke with a 
Lucid Air
 owner at the same location who said he would have had to ""crash my bumper into the charging station"" to top up at one of the standard stalls, so he chose the lone Supercharger off to the side that was positioned differently. 
 
Tesla owners sometimes experience 
long lines at charging stations
, particularly during popular travel times. 
Ford
, 
Chevy
, and 
Hyundai
 owners clogging up Superchargers could frustrate Tesla owners further if the company fails to roll out a fix before deploying Magic Docks to more locations. The simplest solution, it seems, would be to add longer cables that can reach the charging ports on more vehicles. 
 
Tesla's chargers being open to anyone is set to be a boon for EV owners who currently rely on an inconsistent patchwork of charging providers. The move allows Tesla to access some of the $7.5 billion in federal funding set aside for improving charging infrastructure.

He revealed that Tesla has already sourced parts worth USD 1 billion from India.









Addressing the Annual Session of the 63rd Automobile Component Manufacturers Association of India, he said'Tesla already last year bought USD 1 billion of components from all of you sitting here. I have a list of companies who supplied to Tesla. This year their target is nearly USD 1.7 billion or USD 1.9 billion.'

According to the EEOC's suit, since at least 2015 to the present, Black employees at Tesla's Fremont, California manufacturing facilities have routinely endured racial abuse, pervasive stereotyping, and hostility as well as epithets such as variations of the N-word,'monkey','boy', and'black b***h'.

'Slurs were used casually and openly in high-traffic areas and at worker hubs. Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line,' the EEOC said in a statement late on Thursday.

The EEOC's investigation also found that those who raised objections to racial hostility suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions.

'Every employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed,' said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows.

The lawsuit makes clear that no company is above the law, and the EEOC will vigorously enforce federal civil rights protections to help ensure American workplaces are free from unlawful harassment and retaliation, Burrows added.

EEOC San Francisco District Office Director Nancy Sienko said that when you let a standard slip, you've set a new standard.

'Determining that prolific racial slurs do not merit serious discipline and failing to correct harassing conduct sends an entirely wrong message to employees. It also violates an employer's legal responsibility to act swiftly and effectively to stop race-based harassment,' Sienko noted.

In April 2022, Tesla revealed in a financial filing that the EEOC had an'open investigation' into the company. Tesla engaged in a mandatory conciliation process with the agency but was not successful.

Since at least 2015, ""Black employees at Tesla's Fremont, California, manufacturing facilities have routinely endured racial abuse, pervasive stereotyping, and hostility as well as epithets,"" the commission said in a statement.

The EEOC added: ""Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line.""

The lawsuit was brought by the EEOC's San Francisco District Office, which has jurisdiction over Northern California, northern Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Idaho and Montana.

EEOC officials said the lawsuit is seeking compensatory and punitive damages ""and back pay for the affected workers, as well as injunctive relief designed to reform Tesla's employment practices to prevent such discrimination in the future.""

EEOC Chairperson Charlotte A. Burrows said the lawsuit ""makes clear that no company is above the law.""

""The EEOC will vigorously enforce federal civil rights protections to help ensure American workplaces are free from unlawful harassment and retaliation,"" she said.

Attempts to reach officials at Tesla for comment were unsuccessful.

Tesla, the world's most valuable car company, faces similar action on several other fronts.

In February, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit on behalf of more than 4,000 current and former Black Tesla workers — the largest racial discrimination suit ever brought by the state based on number of workers affected.

In that suit, three former employees alleged that racist slurs in English and Spanish were often aimed at Black employees by co-workers and supervisors. They said Tesla segregated Black workers into separate areas, gave them the hardest tasks and routinely denied them promotions. And they alleged that when they informed the company about racist treatment, their complaints went ignored or they were fired.

Tesla disputed the former employees' accounts, stating that the three workers did not complain to the company about racism and that any discipline they received was the result of their own workplace behavior.

""Race plays no role in any of Tesla's work assignments, promotions, pay or discipline,"" attorneys for the company said in a statement at the time. "" Tesla prohibits discrimination, in any form.""

Thursday's lawsuit puts a different kind of pressure on Tesla, said attorney Clifton W. Albright, founding partner and president of Albright, Yee & Schmit, a labor and employment law firm in downtown Los Angeles.

""The EEOC's preference is to resolve issues quietly.... They don't have a dog in this fight,"" he said, unlike lawsuits filed by private firms or civil rights organizations.

""For the EEOC to come out so strongly, they must think there is significant evidence that the employer refuses or fails to recognize or address.""",pressdemocrat.com,4861,business,US,en,"Los Angeles Times,RONALD D.

A federal anti-discrimination agency filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing Elon Musk's Tesla of allowing ""pervasive"" racism at its Silicon Valley car plant and retaliating against Black workers who opposed such abuse.

Black workers at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, have routinely endured stereotyping, racial insults and hostility since at least 2015, according to the suit filed in federal court by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Tesla ""subjected Black employees at its manufacturing facilities in Fremont, California... to severe or pervasive racial harassment and created and maintained a hostile work environment because of their race,"" the lawsuit said.

""The racial misconduct was frequent, ongoing, inappropriate, unwelcome and occurred across all shifts, departments and positions,"" the commission said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Racist graffiti at the plant included swastikas, nooses and threats, according to the suit. Some of the graffiti was allegedly on vehicles rolling off the production line.

The commission said Black workers routinely endured racist slurs including variations of the ""N-word,"" along with ""monkey"" and ""boy.""

""Slurs were used casually and openly in high-traffic areas and at worker hubs,"" according to the EEOC.

Tesla supervisors and managers witnessed racial abuses but did not intervene, and Tesla failed to take steps to address the misconduct, according to the suit.

Black Tesla workers who complained of racist treatment found themselves switched to undesirable duties or shifts, written up unjustly or even discharged, the lawsuit maintained.

""After I voiced my unhappiness, I started getting written up for every little thing that was acceptable before -- like listening to music while working,"" court documents quoted a Black Tesla worker as saying.

The commission said it was unable to reach a settlement with Tesla.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages along with compensation for wronged Black workers and an order that Tesla curb racism at the factory.

The Fremont plant has been under scrutiny previously, with California suing Tesla last year alleging discrimination and harassment against Black workers at the facility, which the complaint called a ""racially segregated workplace.""

The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which enforces the state's civil rights laws, said it had received hundreds of complaints from workers.

Tesla at that time released a statement saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment"" and that it is committed to providing ""a workplace that is safe, respectful, fair and inclusive.""

Separately, a number of female Tesla workers filed lawsuits in 2021 alleging sexual harassment at the Fremont plant, and a Black worker was awarded millions of dollars in a separate racism case.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/28/AFP_c61cbimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.7939143,899e5e94e6a3d76cf03f70a73102f890
601,Why The 2023 Tesla Model 3 Continues To Dominate The EV Market,Aniebiet Inyang Ntui,2023-09-25 00:00:00,date,https://www.topspeed.com/why-tesla-model-3-continues-to-dominate-ev-market,topspeed.com,"The 2024 Tesla Model 3 Highland has been revealed in Europe, but here's why the supposedly 'dated' 2023 Model 3 still dominates the EV market.","With more than one million units sold since 2017, the Tesla Model 3 has not only achieved remarkable sales figures but has also secured its position as one of the top-selling electric vehicles in history. The Model 3 holds a significance for Tesla akin to the Model T's significance for Ford, as it has played a pivotal role in driving substantial revenue growth. This success has propelled Tesla from a niche electric vehicle manufacturer to a prominent player in the industry, achieving a market capitalization of one trillion dollars in the preceding year.

The Model 3 has maintained its presence in the market for over five years without substantial alterations, leading us to ponder why it continues to dominate the electric vehicle market. This dominance persists despite the controversies surrounding its CEO, Elon Musk, and the absence of major changes to the vehicle itself.



The Model 3's Design Pleases All And Offends None

Tesla

The Model 3 deviates from the bold design language typically associated with Tesla's other vehicle models. It incorporates more inviting aesthetic elements and smooth contours that create an approachable impression. The vehicle retains Tesla's distinctive front end, which notably eschews a traditional grille, unlike most electric vehicles, such as the Mercedes EQS, which often feature grille-like elements. We admire Tesla's departure from conventional automotive design trends in this regard.

Despite its classification as a sedan, the Model 3 possesses attributes reminiscent of a sports coupe. Its sleek, retractable door handles, frameless windows, and sloping fastback rear end collectively contribute to this sports car-like appearance, which plays a role in its appeal to a younger demographic. Before even entering the Tesla Model 3, you'll be intrigued by its innovative key card, which utilizes short-range radio-frequency identification (RFID) signals for unlocking, locking, and driving the vehicle.

2023 Tesla Model 3 Exterior Dimensions

Length 184.5 inches Width 82.2 inches Height 56.8 inches Wheelbase 113.2 inches Curb Weight 3,648 lbs - 4,250 lbs



The Model 3's Minimalist Interior Breaks With Tradition

Close

The Model 3's interior is notably minimalist, with the exception of a pair of rotary knobs on the steering wheel. For navigation, communication, and entertainment, a prominent 15-inch monolithic touchscreen takes center stage on the dashboard. The seats are crafted from stain-resistant, vegan materials, offering both an appealing aesthetic and a more sustainable alternative to traditional seating materials. Tesla's well-known penchant for uncluttered interiors continues with the Model 3, appealing to a younger demographic and cost-effectively streamlining assembly.

While some areas, such as the center console, may lack visual flair, the overall interior maintains an attractive appearance. Once seated inside the Model 3, your attention is immediately drawn to the impressive 15-inch central display screen, which consolidates control functions for the entire vehicle. This display exhibits crisp resolution and smooth graphics, catering to the tastes of younger consumers who are enthusiastic about Tesla's offerings. New additions for this year include two convenient wireless charging pads positioned beneath the central screen, angled to allow quick glances at notifications—an example of considerate design.

A notable departure from traditional automobile design is the complete absence of physical buttons or knobs on the Model 3's dashboard. Instead, the steering wheel features two scroll wheels that manage a range of functions, from adjusting side mirrors to controlling volume. This approach, akin to the buttons on a video game controller, has proven surprisingly effective, prompting the question of why more established automakers have not embraced this philosophy. In contrast to Henry Ford's famous declaration about the Model T, Elon Musk offers Model 3 customers a choice between two interior colors: black or white.

An electric drivetrain's advantage lies in its minimal mechanical components, which translates to abundant interior space in the Model 3. The absence of transmission tunnels and driveshafts results in a completely flat floor, eliminating the age-old issue of cramped legroom for the middle-seat occupant. Furthermore, the lack of a front engine provides two advantages: a front trunk (frunk) with 3.1 cubic feet of cargo space and a low hoodline, enhancing visibility for the driver. Combined with the standard panoramic sunroof, the Model 3's interior exudes a sense of openness and brightness.

The 2023 Tesla Model 3 impressively boasts a spacious storage area. With both front and rear trunks, the vehicle offers a combined cargo space of 23 cubic feet, surpassing the offerings of more expensive models like the BMW i4. For additional storage capacity, the rear seats feature a 60/40 split-folding layout, as noted in Car and Driver's Tesla Model 3 review. Folding the rear seats creates ample room for up to 15 carry-on suitcases, and the seatbacks fold completely flat to accommodate larger items with ease.

Three Trims That Meet The Performance Needs Of Everyone

Tesla

The 2023 Tesla Model 3 is available in three distinct variants: Rear-wheel drive, Long Range, and Performance. The rear-wheel-drive model serves as the entry-level option, catering to practical buyers seeking a vehicle for daily commutes and errands. While it offers a range of up to 272 miles on a full charge, it may not be the ideal choice for extended road trips. Additionally, it takes 5.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph, making it less impressive in terms of electric torque.

The middle-tier offering is the Long Range variant, featuring a dual-motor drivetrain and a larger battery pack that extends the range to 358 miles. Beyond the enhanced range, this version delivers improved performance, propelling you from 0 to 60 mph in a more impressive 4.2 seconds. However, it's not primarily designed for speed, with a top speed of 145 mph, a modest increase of just five mph over the base model.

For those seeking top-tier performance and the ability to truly amaze, the Model 3 Performance trim is the ultimate choice. This iteration retains the dual-motor setup of the Long Range but offers an astonishing 445 horsepower. Accelerating from 0 to 60 mph takes a mere 3.1 seconds, and if you have the opportunity to unleash its potential outside public roads, it can continue to reach speeds of up to 162 mph.

Each Tesla Model 3 comes standard with the Basic Autopilot system, which enables features like automatic acceleration, braking, and steering, providing assistance during long-distance drives. However, it's crucial to note that the driver is responsible for supervising the vehicle while in Autopilot mode. Tesla offers an Enhanced Autopilot system as an optional upgrade for an additional $6,000.

This advanced system includes features such as automatic parking, lane changing, and navigation assistance. For a more comprehensive experience, Tesla offers the Full Self Driving system for an extra $15,000. This system combines the functionalities of the Basic Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot while also including the ability to detect traffic lights and stop signs, marking a significant step toward autonomous driving capabilities.

Tesla has built a reputation for manufacturing some of the safest vehicles on the road. Its commitment to safety is evident through the use of robust passenger compartments and state-of-the-art collision avoidance systems, consistently surpassing industry benchmarks for crash safety. The Model 3 upholds this tradition by achieving 5-star safety ratings across all categories from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Furthermore, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has recognized the Model 3 as a Top Safety Pick across all of its evaluated categories. Notably, the Model 3's design, with its battery packs situated beneath the cabin, contributes to an exceptionally low center of gravity, minimizing the risk of rollovers. These remarkable safety achievements are particularly impressive for a compact sedan.",topspeed.com,8706,business,US,en,Aniebiet Inyang Ntui,https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-tesla-model-3-1.jpg,False,@topspeed,7.740185,8a3f26dddfcc6a652a70b6fd91263c2b

This lawsuit stems from allegations made by several black workers who assert that they faced racial discrimination within the company.

The EEOC's lawsuit brings to light disturbing incidents that reportedly unfolded within Tesla's flagship Fremont plant, where black workers endured verbal abuse and racial discrimination. The commission contends that despite numerous complaints filed by employees regarding such incidents, Tesla's management failed to take any meaningful action to address these grievances.

In many cases, Tesla fired their employees or retaliated over the complaints of racial discrimination. The commission tried to settle the lawsuit with Tesla outside the court but Tesla didn't confirm to the settlement demands which led to the breaking down of settlement talks.

As a result of that, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued Tesla in a federal court. California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which is now called the Civil Rights Department has also filed a case against Tesla for the discrimination of blacks in their company.

California's Civil Rights Department has alleged multiple violations of the Californian state law by Tesla on the grounds of racial discrimination. Tesla has responded to the lawsuit by claiming it to be politically motivated. It also said that the Civil Rights Department broke state laws by directly filing a lawsuit without any notice to the automobile company.

A former employee in Tesla, Owen Diaz earlier won a case against the company on the grounds of racial discrimination. A jury awarded him $3.2 million in April this year. A different jury granted him $137 million in 2021 but the judge reduced the compensatory value to $15 million.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA) has reported third-quarter delivery figures that missed Wall Street expectations.

The company run by Elon Musk blamed the lower-than-expected deliveries on planned maintenance shutdowns and upgrades at its manufacturing plants around the world.

As a result, Tesla, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on October 18, delivered 435,059 vehicles in the three months ended September 30, down 7% from the previous quarter.

Analysts who cover the company had forecast deliveries of 459,949 vehicles for the latest quarter, according to an LSEG poll.

Tesla said that its production in the quarter took a hit as it carried out planned upgrades at its factories to roll out a newer version of its Model 3 electric sedan.

The company produced 430,488 vehicles in the third quarter, versus 479,700 in the previous three-month period.

Despite missing expectations, Tesla maintained its target to deliver 1.8 million vehicles for all of this year.

Deliveries of the updated and higher-priced Model 3 are expected to begin in the current fourth quarter, while a Cybertruck launch event is planned by year's end.

Tesla has been cutting prices aggressively in recent months to counter a slowing automotive market and fend off competition from rival automakers such as Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Toyota (TM).

In the just completed third quarter, Tesla cut prices of its premium Model S and Model X electric vehicles by as much as 21% in the U.S. and China.

NewYork: Tesla reported Monday that its new auto deliveries fell in the third quarter compared with the three months prior, but the company's full-year volume target stayed unchanged.

The electric automaker led by Elon Musk said the sequential decline ""was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades,"" according to a press release.

Deliveries were 435,059 in the July to September period, down about seven percent from the three-month stretch before.

Musk, during a July 19 conference call, had signaled that volumes would be lower in the third quarter due to ""summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades.""

The Tesla statement did not specify which plants underwent maintenance, but Wedbush analysts said longer than expected downtimes at Shanghai and Austin were responsible for volumes that were ""nothing to write home about.""

Production declined 10 percent from the second quarter to 430,488, according to the figures.

But Tesla confirmed that its full-year volume target of 1.8 million vehicles remained unchanged.

Tesla is set to report quarterly results later this month. In the second quarter, the company scored a surge in revenues to $24.9 billion as a series of price cuts boosted sales.

During the second quarter conference call, Musk spoke glowingly of the new Cybertruck, Tesla's futuristic answer to the American pickup truck model.

Musk has said the Cybertruck would begin deliveries in 2023. Tesla's statement Monday did not mention the vehicle.

Tesla (TSLA) has again lowered the prices on some editions of its Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles in the U.S. as sales continue to slump.

The price cuts come days after Tesla reported third-quarter deliveries that missed the expectations of Wall Street analysts.

Tesla said that, effective immediately, the starting price for the Model 3 has been lowered to $38,990 U.S., down from $40,240 U.S. previously.

The price on the long-range Model 3 model has been lowered from $47,240 U.S. to $45,990 U.S. And the price on the Model 3 Performance edition has been brought down to $50,990 U.S. from $53,240 U.S.

At the same time, Tesla's Model Y Performance sports utility vehicle (SUV) has seen its starting price lowered to $52,490 U.S. from $54,490 U.S.

Tesla has been cutting prices on its electric vehicles worldwide for nearly a year now in a bid to entice cash-strapped consumers, and as competition in the electric vehicle space heats up.

Earlier this week, Tesla reported Q3 vehicle deliveries of 435,059, missing analyst expectations and marking a decline from the previous second-quarter of the year.

Tesla blamed the Q3 delivery miss on scheduled maintenance at its manufacturing facilities, which idled production in August.

However, despite the latest delivery miss, Tesla maintains its guidance to deliver 1.8 million electric vehicles for all of this year.

BYD is poised to overtake billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs) as the Chinese automaker's global sales push gains greater traction, 
Bloomberg
 news reported earlier this week.
 
According to 
Bloomberg
, China's best-selling car brand came within a whisker of toppling Tesla in the last quarter after factory downtime led to the US automaker's first delivery decline in more than a year.
 
""BYD sold 431,603 fully electric vehicles in the three months ended September 30, up 23 per cent from the second quarter. Tesla shipped 435,059 cars globally in the quarter, with the 3,456 gap between the two the narrowest yet,"" 
Bloomberg
 said.
 
""BYD will sell more fully electric passenger vehicles than Tesla in the fourth quarter,"" the report quotes Taylor Ogan, chief executive of Shenzhen-based hedge fund Snow Bull Capital, which owns shares in both automakers.
 
""Including hybrids, BYD sold a total of 822,094 vehicles for another record quarter, helping it cement its lead as China's best-selling car brand,"" the 
Bloomberg
 report said.
 
BYD, which is known for selling affordable cars to the masses, has made progress in broadening its appeal, aiding its sales surge.
 
The company has added two luxury EV brands — Yangwang and Fang Cheng Bao — to penetrate the 1 million yuan price category, more than double some of its earlier higher-end vehicles. It also pushed two cheaper models — the Seagull and Dolphin — to undercut its rivals, 
Bloomberg
 reported.
 
""Growing exports are also aiding the company, which also makes its own batteries and semiconductor chips, as it eyes a larger chunk of overseas sales to supplement its dominance in China,"" the 
Bloomberg 
report stated.
 
The news organisation also quoted its intelligence analyst Joanne Chen as saying that exports accounted for nine per cent of BYD's third-quarter sales, up from five per cent in the previous quarter.
 
""This will be a key volume driver [in 2024] as BYD expands its global presence with more new EVs,"" Chen said.
 
Bloomberg also reported that Tesla's deliveries missed estimates by around 20,000 units as it prepared its factories to make a refreshed Model 3 sedan and the yet-to-be-released Cybertruck.
 
However, the company affirmed its annual target of selling 1.8 million vehicles, while BYD remains on track to sell around three million vehicles, including hybrids,

609,'It looks like a child's toy': 3 car designers react to the Tesla Cybertruck,Insider,2023-10-05 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/10/05/it-looks-like-a-child-s-toy-3-car-designers-react-to-tesla-cybertruck/,autoblog.com,"As Tesla Cybertruck deliveries near, we asked car-design experts what they think of the truck. They didn't have many nice things to say.","The 
Tesla Cybertruck
 is coming to customers soon, and it looks almost identical to this early prototype. 
Samantha Delouya
 
 
 
To some, the upcoming 
Tesla Cybertruck
 looks like a clumsily designed, doorstop-shaped monstrosity. To others, the pickup's stainless steel body and bold, science fiction-inspired styling further prove 
Elon Musk's
 unparalleled genius for shaking up the car business.
 
It all depends on who you ask about what's quite possibly the most controversial 
new vehicle
 in recent history.
 
Given that 
Cybertrucks
 are supposed to finally make it to customers any day now, we decided to get some expert opinions on its appearance from three car designers. It's a small sample size, to be sure, but none of the experts we polled were huge fans.
 
""I haven't seen the thing in person yet, but do I really want this threatening-looking thing driving down my street? In my neighborhood? Not really,"" Paul Snyder, chair of the transportation design department at Detroit's College for Creative Studies, told Insider. ""It's not something I would do or buy,"" he added, calling attention to the 
truck's
 dead-flat surfaces and lines.
 
Car companies will often show off adventurous initial designs for a new model, then tone things down when the time comes to actually make it. The near-production Cybertrucks that have been spotted on social media and out in public, however, appear nearly identical to the outlandish, angular truck 
Tesla unveiled nearly four years ago
.
 
Instead of mimicking the upright, boxy shape of conventional pickups, 
Tesla's
 truck looks more like a triangle. Its body panels are straight as a board, not curved like the competition from 
Ford
 and 
General Motors
.
 
 
 
 Elon Musk unveiled the Cybertruck to the world in 2019. 
Frederic J. Brown/AFP
 
 
 
""The aesthetic messaging there is it's kind of a big f--- you to everybody,"" said Snyder, whose design credits include the 
Honda Odyssey
 minivan and cult-favorite 
Ford Flex
 SUV. ""And I think that's the point that they're trying to make, especially to Detroit 
pickup trucks
 and everybody who would buy one.""
 
Matteo Licata, a former car designer and design history professor at 
Italy's
 IAAD (Istituto d'Arte Applicata e Design), said he applauds 
Tesla's
 courage to break norms but that its execution missed the mark.
 
""I can get behind that kind of lo-fi aesthetic, a brutal design that reminds me of the origami cars turned up to 11,"" he said, referring to a school of car design that produced wedge-shaped icons like the DeLorean DMC-12 and 
Lotus Esprit
, a car Musk has said inspired the Cybertruck.
 
Subtle tweaks here and there could have elevated the final product's aesthetic appeal, he said.
 
""In car design, you wouldn't believe how much of a difference some small changes make,"" Licata said. ""I mean they had time, hell, to perfect it. 
It wasn't a rush job
.""
 
Geoff Wardle, the former executive director of the transportation systems and design department at California's ArtCenter College of Design, told Insider the Cybertruck isn't his cup of tea.
 
""Personally, it doesn't turn me on at all. I think it looks crude,"" he said. ""But I understand totally what it's trying to do.""
 
He said he thinks the ""in-your-face, no-nonsense, extreme-looking"" truck may prove popular among Musk's loyal fanbase — if Tesla can manage to produce it with good fit and finish, which 
could be challenging given the unusual design
.
 
Whether the Cybertruck will stand the test of time is another question. Simplicity and purity are hallmarks of timeless design, Snyder said, and Tesla's wacky truck could fit the bill.
 
""You could say that the Cybertruck is also simple and pure — to the extent that it looks like a child's toy made of Legos or something,"" he said. ""So maybe it could be timeless and continue to be controversial for decades.""

Electric vehicles giant Tesla Inc. (ticker: TSLA) is a household name today. At a market capitalization of roughly $790 billion, it's one of the 10 largest public companies in the U.S.

That said, the stock's medium-term performance has been lackluster. Despite a sharp rebound in 2023, investors who acquired the stock in late 2020 are still barely in the green, and anyone who bought in at all-time highs less than a year later is still nursing a nearly 40% loss on paper.

[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]

The story for both short-term and long-term shareholders, however, is much different.

How Much Money Would You Have Made if You Invested in Tesla's IPO?

Tesla went public on June 29, 2010 at $17 per share. TSLA stock, however, opened for trading at $19 per share, and finished the day at $23.89 — a stellar one-day gain of 40.5%.

Return calculations for what an average investor would have earned can't realistically assume a purchase price of $17 per share, as retail investors essentially had no way to buy stocks at their actual IPO price in 2010.

In calculating returns, it's more practical to assume the early Tesla investor purchased shares at its closing price of $23.89. In fact, shares traded below those levels for the majority of normal trading hours, so even this price is somewhat conservative.

If that were all there was to the story, this investment would have walloped the wider market over the last 13 years, rising tenfold.

But due to several aggressive stock splits in recent years, Tesla's long-term performance is even more impressive. There have been two Tesla stock splits in its corporate history:

— a 5-for-1 stock split on Aug. 31, 2020

— a 3-for-1 stock split on Aug. 25, 2022

To compare apples to apples, this means that the cost basis of the initial purchase price should be divided by 15, as one share of Tesla stock in 2010 would have turned into 15 shares by 2023.

On a split-adjusted basis then, the closing price of Tesla stock on June 29, 2010 was $1.59.

At market close on Oct. 2, the stock closed at $251.60 — more than 158 times its adjusted closing price on the first day of trading.

A $10,000 investment in TSLA on the day of its IPO would be worth more than $1.58 million as of Oct. 2.

TSLA Performance vs. the S&P 500

The stock's remarkable 158-fold return works out to a compound annual growth rate of 46.5% since inception. Over the same time, the vaunted S&P 500 has grown at an annualized rate of 11.3%.

That's already an enormous performance gulf, but those differences become even more magnified over time. In stark contrast to the $1.58 million the Tesla IPO investor would be sitting on, a humble S&P 500 investor who put $10,000 into the benchmark index on the same day in 2010 would have $41,185.41 at market close on Oct. 2 — just 2.6% of what the early electric vehicle believer would've ended up with.

Factors Influencing Tesla's Meteoric Rise

Plainly put, Tesla's incredible decade-plus rally has tracked the even more incredible growth of its underlying business. Consider a side-by-side comparison of high-level company metrics back in fiscal 2010 compared to its last reported fiscal year in 2022:

Revenue (in millions) Net income (in millions) Earnings per share Net margin 2022 $81,462 $12,587 $3.62 15.5% 2010 $116.74 ($154.33) ($3.04) -132.2%

The stock's rapid 158-fold ascent was mirrored by a nearly 700-fold uptick in revenue and a dramatic improvement in profitability.

At the time of its IPO, Tesla was undergoing an ambitious experiment that CEO Elon Musk has since admitted was more likely to fail than succeed. Although hybrid vehicles like Toyota Motor Corp.'s (TM) Prius had been around for some time, they certainly weren't sports cars and were a far cry from what one might consider luxury vehicles. Mass-producing electric vehicles and making them sexy and desirable was practically a pipe dream, and major automakers neglected the market opportunity, leaving an open lane for Tesla.

Unlike the software industry, scaling in the capital-intensive auto industry is difficult and expensive. To make the most of its first-mover advantage, Tesla had to rapidly grow its production capacity, which it did at a prodigious pace: In 2010, the company delivered less than 1,600 Tesla Roadsters, which was then its only vehicle. In 2022, it delivered more than 1.31 million cars across its four current models — Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y — none of which existed in 2010.

The last dozen-plus years have also seen the company diversify into areas like insurance, charging infrastructure, and energy storage and generation. Its energy business alone generated $3.9 billion in revenue last year, or more than 33 times the revenue of the entire business in 2010.

A Word of Caution

What Tesla as a company has done in the last dozen-plus years is nothing short of miraculous, and its stock price has rightfully ballooned along with profits.

And while it's a nice thought experiment to see what a $10,000 investment in Tesla at its IPO would be worth today, choosing these diamonds in the rough on Wall Street is exceedingly difficult to do in practice.

First, IPOs are infamously bad times to buy. Companies will seek the highest valuation they can when going public, and newly public stocks tend to underperform the larger market in the short and medium term.

Second, it's just not easy to pick market-beating stocks. A May 2018 paper from Hendrik Bessembinder at Arizona State University found that between 1926 and 2016, the best-performing 4% of public stocks accounted for the entire net gain in the U.S. stock market. The other 96% collectively matched the return of U.S. Treasury bills.

Finally, to reap the enormous rewards an early Tesla investor would be sitting on today, you'd have to keep the faith and hold as the EV innovator lost money year after year for a full decade. It wasn't until 2020 that Tesla turned its first full-year profit.

If you're one of the lucky few to have held firm on Tesla throughout the years, kudos! For everyone else, the hunt for the best stocks to buy now lives on.

In the third quarter, the company produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered over 435,000 vehicles.

The result missed Wall Street expectations. Tesla said planned downtimes at its factories led to lower production and delivery numbers.

""A sequential decline in volumes was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades, as discussed on the most recent earnings call. Our 2023 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged,' said the electric car company.

The company delivered 435,059 vehicles in Q3, a 6.6 per cent decrease over the previous quarter but a 26.5 per cent increase year over year.

Tesla will report its Q3 earnings on October 18.

During its second quarter, Musk had warned that production and delivery numbers would be lower due to the upgrades.

Tesla has delivered 1.32 million vehicles so far this year.

The company is reportedly planning to build a factory for battery storage in India and has submitted a proposal for the same to the government. The electric vehicle major Tesla Inc plans to source automobile parts worth up to $1.9 billion this year from India. Billionaire Musk is also in early talks with South Arabia to build a new EV manufacturing facility there.

However, the c","(MENAFN) Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, announced on Monday that its third-quarter auto deliveries had declined compared to the previous quarter. However, the company emphasized that its full-year volume target remains unchanged. According to a press release, Tesla attributed the sequential decline in deliveries, which totaled 435,059 vehicles in the July to September period, to planned downtimes for factory upgrades.



The figure represents a roughly seven percent decrease from the delivery numbers in the preceding three-month period. Elon Musk had previously indicated during a conference call on July 19 that the third quarter would likely see lower volumes due to ""summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades."" While the press release did not specify which Tesla plants underwent maintenance, analysts at Wedbush suggested that longer-than-expected downtimes at facilities in Shanghai and Austin contributed to the volumes that fell short of expectations.



In addition to lower deliveries, Tesla's production also experienced a decline of approximately 10 percent from the second quarter, with a total of 430,488 vehicles produced during the third quarter, according to the company's figures.

Elon Musk's
 car company navigated through softening customer demand as well as factory upgrades.
 
The Austin, Texas, automaker 
sold 435,059 vehicle
 s during the July-to-September period, up from 343,830 at the same time last year. Analysts had predicted Tesla would sell about 461,000 vehicles during the latest quarter, according to FactSet Research.
 
As usual, 
Tesla's sales
 consisted primarily of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, which have been made even more attractive by 
rounds of price cutting
 that have eaten into the company's profit margins. The third-quarter sales also marked a step back from Tesla's 466,140 vehicle deliveries during the April-to-June period.
 
The company blamed the sequential sales decline on planned downtime to upgrade its factories.
 
Tesla said it made 430,488 vehicles in the latest quarter, slightly below the number it delivered. 
 
Despite large price cuts, sales of the aging models S and X fell 14% year over year to 15,985. 
 
The company will need a big finish to 2023 to realize CEO Musk's stated goal of increasing its sales by 50% annually. To hit that target, Tesla will have to sell 1.97 million vehicles this year. Through the first nine months of the year, Tesla has delivered just over 1.3 million vehicles. Analysts are anticipating Tesla will sell 1.84 million vehicles for the full year.
 
Tesla has been 
slashing prices most of this year
 to keep attracting buyers who now have a wider selection of electric vehicles as more automakers shift away from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The discounts range from $4,400 on Tesla's top-selling vehicles to as much as $20,000 on its most expensive models.
 
Just how much the latest round of cost cutting has trimmed 
Tesla's profit margins
 will be detailed Oct. 18 when it plans to release its third-quarter earnings.
 
Shares of Tesla rose slightly at midday Monday to $251.35. Despite the squeeze that already has occurred on Tesla's profits, the company's stock price has doubled so far this year. Part of the run-up has stemmed from a deal allowing rivals General Motors and Ford to 
join its charging network
.
 
Tesla also could be an indirect beneficiary from a 
labor strike that began last month
 and continues to close down factories operated by GM, Ford and Stellantis. The United Auto Workers labor union is demanding major wage increases that would likely drive up the prices of their cars and trucks — a pain point that Tesla isn't facing with its non-union workforce.
 
The 
UAW is also fighting for higher wages
 and union representation at factories that make the batteries for electric vehicles, demands that the U.S. automakers are resisting in a battle they say they need to win to remain competitive with Tesla and foreign companies.

The Indonesian government, under Preside","(MENAFN- Asia Times) For several years, Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have flirted with entering the Indonesian market.

The Indonesian government, under President Joko Widodo, has made overtures, with powerful actors like Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan showing up at Tesla's manufacturing plant in Texas in April 2022 to promote investment opportunities in Indonesia.

On the sidelines of the 2022 G20 summit in Bali,

Musk was interviewed

by Anindya Bakrie, CEO of Bakrie and Brothers, and said he was'bullish' on Indonesia. Despite these sentiments, Tesla has not made a big move in the country.



This lack of progress probably stings a little bit more given that Tesla opened a

sales office in Malaysia

and will be

opening a showroom

in Thailand. Indonesia may be beginning to wonder if it is being passed over by Tesla and the reasons behind this decision.

The first aspect to consider is Tesla's objectives in Indonesia and Indonesia's motivation for collaboration with Tesla. Indonesia is not currently a major market for electric vehicles. There are few charging stations and the national road system is underdeveloped.



Government subsidies intended to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles have been hotly debated. In the short term, Indonesia is more likely to be a bigger consumer of electric scooters – which Tesla does not make – than electric cars.

If the goal is to sell four-wheeled electric vehicles in Southeast Asia in the near future, Tesla seems to believe Malaysia is a more attractive market.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/10/AT_cd9a1image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,9.1282215,e2a337a8841e4b52e34d2a820e49b838

This is","(MENAFN- Baystreet) What To Do After Tesla Slashed Prices Again

On Oct. 6, 2023, Tesla cut prices for its Model 3 sedan by 2.7% and the Model Y SUV by 4.2%. This is in response to weak demand. Before that, the firm posted weak deliveries.

Tesla reported production of 430,488 vehicles and 435,059 deliveries during the third quarter. Volumes declined sequentially because of factory upgrades. In effect, the volume miss is not a negative development for long-term shareholders. Factory updates will improve quality and efficiency. Conversely, second-place firms like GM (GM), Rivian (RIVN), and Ford (F) continue to lose money.

Tesla has a significant lead on demand advantages and low supply costs. Margins will rise after it cuts prices. It will encourage EV buyers to pick Tesla's model first and foremost. After the cost for each unit of production fell steadily this year, Tesla should report higher profitability.

TSLA stock will likely outperform its peers. Firms that started selling vehicles have a mountain of headwinds to overcome. Fisker (FSR) is targeting the budget market which will increase its costs. Rivian must contend with Tesla's Cyber truck next. And Lucid (LCID) faces competition from Tesla's Model S and Plaid editions.

The chief minister said the state has set the goal of raising its contribution to the nation's economic output from a little over 8% now to 10% by 2026-27, by which time it hopes to become a $500 billion economy. The state is banking on game-changing projects in this journey, including the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail project and creating a global manufacturing and trading hub while greening the economy and building a green hydrogen hub, the chief minister said. Edited excerpts:How do you plan to achieve a 13% growth for Gujarat's economy in nominal terms for 2023-24, which is faster than the 10.5% growth projected for India?Gujarat has consistently outperformed the national growth rate, rightfully earning the title of the 'growth engine of India'. Despite comprising only 5% of the country's population, Gujarat contributes over 8.3% to the national GDP (gross domestic product). In the previous year, the state accounted for 33% of India's total merchandise exports. Strong global ties and a diversified GSDP (gross state domestic product) make our economy exceptionally resilient government has set a target to contribute 10% to India's economy and achieve a $500 billion economy by 2026-27.

This","(MENAFN) Tesla, the world's leading electric car manufacturer, has announced yet another round of price reductions for its vehicles in the United States. This marks the seventh time this year that the Texas-based company has taken steps to lower its prices. Various factors have contributed to these consistent price cuts, reflecting the company's dynamic approach to the electric vehicle market.



In this latest move, Tesla has reduced the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the US by up to 4.2 percent, as indicated on its official website. The base and long-range versions of the Model 3 now come with price reductions of USD1,250, bringing their new prices to USD38,990 and USD45,990, respectively. Meanwhile, the performance model of the Model 3 has seen a price reduction of USD2,250, resulting in a new price of USD50,990.



For the Model Y, both the long-range and performance variants have been subject to a price reduction of USD2,000, setting their new prices at USD48,490 and USD52,490, respectively. Interestingly, the rear-wheel-drive version of the Model Y, reintroduced this week, remains priced at USD43,990.



These price adjustments underscore a significant trend in Tesla's pricing strategy. Notably, the standard Model 3 has seen its price decrease by approximately 17 percent since the beginning of this year, while the long-range option for the Model Y has experienced a reduction of over 25 percent in its price.



Furthermore, this price reduction for the Model 3 coincides with the impending deliveries of its revamped standard version, expected to commence in the fourth quarter. Tesla, however, opted not to alter the prices of its top-tier Model S and Model X vehicles, indicating a selective approach to pricing adjustments within its product lineup.



Tesla's frequent price cuts reflect its proactive stance in the electric vehicle market, where competition is intensifying. These adjustments aim to make Tesla's electric cars more accessible to a wider range of consumers and demonstrate the company's commitment to remaining a leader in the industry.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_Aviationtransport_166.jpg,False,@menafn,7.6626086,dee90df5ee6f86eda6c36ef67fa46c06

Ctrl-Bar brings physical buttons back to Tesla. Keep your eyes on the road while you control essential functions. Drive Safe. Drive with full Ctrl.

Six buttons can easily be programmed to functions you want quick access to while driving.

Ctrl-Bar can illuminate your center console with lighting from a series of powerful LEDs. Scroll through different colors and brightness settings on your Ctrl-Bar to find the perfect color for your drive!

Norwegian start-up Greenmission has developed the world's first ""Ctrl-Bar"", which returns physical buttons to Tesla owners.

- Vetle AG Husby

OSLO, OSLO, NORWAY, October 12, 2023 /EINPresswire / -- Norwegian start-up Greenmission has developed the world's first ""Ctrl-Bar "", which returns physical buttons to Tesla owners.

This is in response to an increasing irritation among Tesla owners over the lack of buttons and concerns from authorities related to the increasing number of accidents caused by distracted drivers.

Following a successful crowdfunding campaign on INDIEGOGO, which was oversubscribed by over 350%, the product is now ready.

""Tesla's lack of physical buttons is one of the worst trends in the auto industry right now,"" according to Autoevolution. Greenmission has now solved this problem. Ctrl-Bar returns physical buttons to the world's most advanced car.

""I'm super happy with my Tesla (model Y) – but one thing increasingly irritated me: It was impossible to change functions such as temperature while keeping an eye on the road. After much trial and error, I found the solution. This has now become Ctrl-Bar,"" says Vetle Husby, founder and CEO of Greenmission AS.

Ctrl-Bar is attached to the lower edge as an extension of the existing screen. It has two black aluminium wheels for temperature control and six programmable buttons for optional functions. It also features an information display and LED lights for optional coloured lights in the cabin.

The product has received enthusiastic reviews on some of the world's largest YouTube channels, and a large number of Ctrl-Bar units have already been pre-sold before the launch.

It took seven months of hard work to develop the product, which included the development of its own electronics, circuit boards, app, firmware, and control systems, in addition to the physical Ctrl-Bar. The unique design is protected on all continents.

About Greenmission:

Greenmission is a Norwegian startup founded by 19-year-old Vetle Husby. Husby has previously developed the ""TESLA WIRELESS CHARGER 2"", now sold globally. The profits from this project funded the development of the Ctrl-Bar.

TRAVAGLIATO,

 — Idra, an Italian aluminum casting machine maker and

 supplier, has added 
Ford

Hyundai

Tesla has pioneered the use of massive casting machines, also known as ""gigapresses,"" to make large single pieces of vehicle underbodies, streamline production and reduce the work even of

A ""gigapress 6,100,"" which produces a clamping force of over 6,000 tons, with the Ford brand printed on it, had been assembled and was being tested in IDRA's plant in Travalgiato, near Brescia, northern Italy during an industry event organized by the company on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
An even bigger press, the 9,000, IDRA's largest and newest model — the size of a small house or a tennis court — was being tested nearby but without the client's name printed on it.
 
A source close to the matter, however, said it would be shipped to Hyundai group, adding both it and the one for Ford would initially be used only for R&D purposes.
 
The source said IDRA was also about to sign a supply contract for two 9,000 presses with a premium automaker in Europe, its first with a European group. 
Volvo and Toyota
 are among the companies exploring the process. 
Toyota recently showed off
 casting machinery that can make a third of a car underbody in 3 minutes. This normally requires

Electric vehicle startup IM Motors launched its third model, the LS6, on Thursday in Shanghai with four variants priced from 214,900 yuan ($29,420) to 276,900 yuan, in efforts to compete with the Tesla Model Y.
 
The model has received more than 30,000 orders since presales began in September.
 
The SUV is 4,904 millimeters in length with the wheelbase stretching to 2,950 mm.
 
Equipped with an Nvidia Orin X high computing power chip and high-precision LiDAR, the model features more than 100 state-of-the-art technology configurations. This includes an industry unique full digital cockpit screen, which displays road condition information and solves blind spot hazards.
 
According to Liu Tao, CEO of IM Motors, the L7 and LS7 models on the market, which compete with BMW's 5 Series and X5, are to establish a high-end pure EV position for the brand.
 
The newly-launched LS6 and the upcoming L6, to compete with the Tesla Model 3, aim to boost the brand's sales, Liu added.
 
Established by China's largest automaker by sales SAIC Motor, IT giant Alibaba and Zhangjiang High-tech in 2020, IM Motors completed in two years what took its competitors nine years to accomplish in self-driving technology, said Liu.
 
He added that its high-speed Navigate on Autopilot, or NOA, covers 26 cities, including Beijing.
 
""Our weakness lies in brand awareness, as IM Motors has not quickly risen to the top tier of EV startups within the past two years but belongs to the upper level of the second tier. In the first half of this year, IM has made the fastest progress in the field with brand awareness but still stands at only 76.8 percent,"" said Liu.
 
He added that it will continue to make efforts to enhance brand awareness through marketing events targeted at the young generation and opening more sales outlets.

When Tesla cut its vehicle prices and more recently announced a pay raise for its German plant worker","(MENAFN- Baystreet) Tesla, Rivian, Polestar: Which EV Is a Buy?

When Tesla cut its vehicle prices and more recently announced a pay raise for its German plant workers, it widened its lead against the other firms. The competitors are nearly 10 years too late in breaking into Tesla's market.

Tesla will announce details of the pay raise in November. It previously increased wages by 6% in the previous year. The wage increase averts any risk of a strike. To grow market share and increase demand, Tesla cut the prices of its Model 3 by 2.7%. The Model Y SUV will cost 4.2% less, or $2,000 less. The base Model 3 is now 17% lower compared to the start of the year.

Rivian (RIVN) has serious near-term costs that investors need to worry about. To reduce losses per vehicle sold, the firm is front-loading or fast-forwarding its capital expenditure. It priced its $1.5 billion green convertible senior notes due in 2030. If shares trade at $30.28, shareholders will get diluted. Although the conversion price is substantially higher than the current price, it sets a limit on the stock's upside.

Polestar (PSNY), is even less attractive. The firm filed a mixed shelf offering to raise as much as $1 billion. Investors should beware of buying PSNY stock amid further dilution.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/18/B_d37bcimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.743374,c4de43d2a64a5c4d45367d4dce83eda8

Tesla's results for the third quarter missed analyst estimates on Wednesday, as the Elon Musk-run company was hit by higher costs and the fallout from price discounts.

The Texas-based electric vehicle giant said sales in the July to September period reached $23.35 billion, lower than the $24.19 billion forecasted by analysts polled by Factset.

The company also saw net profits come in less than hoped for, at 66 cents per share instead of 73 cents forecasted.

Musk has undertaken multiple price cuts throughout 2023 on vehicles, telling investors in April that the company has taken the view that pushing for higher sales is the right choice versus taking a bigger margin.

The move came as more EVs from legacy carmakers like General Motors and Ford are hitting dealerships.

But those rivals have been punished by a major strike in the United States, something that Tesla will not have to navigate.

The price cuts have made investors nervous and Tesla's share price slid more than seven percent in the last month and was down more than three percent from its last closing price in afterhours trade.

The Tesla stock valuation however still dwarfs other US car makers and it has more than doubled in 2023, comforting Musk's position as one of the world's two richest people.

Also rattling nerves, Tesla reported earlier this month that its new auto deliveries fell in the third quarter to 435,059 units because of downtimes at factories in Shanghai and Austin.

Production overall declined 10 percent from the second quarter to 430,488, according to the figures.

But Tesla on Wednesday confirmed that its full-year volume target of 1.8 million vehicles remained unchanged.

Tesla also said that it will stick to the timetable and release the new Cybertruck, Tesla's futuristic answer to the American pickup truck, by the end of this year.

But Musk told an earnings call that the Cybertruck would be expensive and have ""enormous challenges"" in reaching target production.

""I think we'll end up with roughly a quarter-million cyber trucks a year... sometime in 2025,"" he said.

- 'Truly astounding' -

The company again insisted that investing in AI and software that will soon deliver autonomous driving was the right investment.

""The economics of autonomous vehicles are truly astounding in a positive way,"" Musk said of a technology he says is just around the corner.

While the market for electric vehicles has been on an unquestioned growth trajectory, signs emerged recently that the boom could be slowing.

General Motors said Tuesday it was delaying the conversion of a plant to produce electric vehicle (EV) trucks, citing changes in demand as a factor.

And higher interest rates have put a further brake on new car-buying after surfing on more than a decade of super low interest rates that enticed shoppers towards trading up to the latest models.

""I keep harping on this interest rate thing, but it just raises the cost of the car,"" Musk complained on the earnings call.

Musk's unique status as a visionary entrepreneur who created SpaceX and Tesla has taken a knock since his buyout a year ago of Twitter, now renamed X, for $44 billion.

The tycoon's stewardship of X has proven to be tumultuous with lower advertiser spending and the platform increasingly seen as a toxic breeding ground for unmoderated speech and conspiracy theories.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/18/AFP_f2278image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.705337,4ad0b6c0d32bde6fe2432d9331ede277

Stockholm: Tesla mechanics in Sweden will walk off the job on October 27 unless the electric carmaker agrees to sign a collective wage agreement, the metalworkers union IF Metall said Wednesday.

""Over a long period of time, we have attempted to discuss with Tesla the signing of a collective agreement, without success. Now we see no solution other than to take industrial action,"" the union said in a statement.

The strike would affect Tesla's 120 mechanics at seven workshops across Sweden, IF Metall spokesman Jesper Pettersson told AFP.

He said ""many"" of Tesla's workers in Sweden were members of IF Metall, but would not disclose an exact number.

Despite being union members, they cannot benefit from industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.

Negotiated by sector-by-sector, collective agreements are the basis of the Swedish labour market model, covering almost 90 percent of all Swedish employees and guaranteeing standard wages and working conditions.

""This conflict is about our members' wages, pensions and insurances. And in the end it is about the playing rules on the Swedish labour market,"" said the head of IF Metall's collective agreements, Veli-Pekka Saikkala.

IF Metall, which has some 300,000 members, said the agreements also allow for companies ""to operate on a level playing field, while avoiding the risk of any one employer distorting competition in the sector by imposing poor conditions on their employees.""

Tesla has yet to comment on the strike call.

Its founder and chief Elon Musk has consistently rejected calls to allow Tesla's 127,000 employees worldwide to unionise.

""Even though we have called for industrial action, it is our sincere hope that Tesla will begin to negotiate and sign a collective agreement for their employees in Sweden,"" IF Metall said.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/18/TP_a7bcaimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.3389635,2b518e0473d36735cfc5c108cd21344f

Indonesia's nickel downstreaming policies aim to use the country's vast nickel reserves and ore production to add value by processing raw ore into higher-grade nickel intermediates. These higher-grade nickel intermediates are essential components used in the production of stainless steel and nickel cobalt manganese (NCM)-based EV batteries.

In terms of attracting investment, Indonesia's

nickel downstreaming policies

have produced results. In 2020, Indonesia banned the export of raw nickel ore to attract investment, largely in nickel smelters.



A year later,

the country received

downstream investments and commitments from Chinese companies totaling some US$30 billion. As of July 2023,

there were already

43 nickel smelters operating, 28 under construction and 24 in the planning stage.

Indonesia processes its laterite nickel ore through two smelting methods. One method, well-suited to Indonesia's nickel ore, uses a pyrometallurgical (class 2) treatment for lower-grade nickel grade to produce nickel pig iron, a key component in stainless steel production.



The other (class 1) treatment for higher-grade nickel requires a high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) process to produce mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), used in lithium-ion NCM battery cathodes. Most smelting investments have been for producing class 1 high-grade nickel NCM battery cathodes, driven by the growing demand for EV batteries.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/16/AT_45b73image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.3389635,ad6cbbe0c58e6fa07b0804ff789c123f

""With NACS, customers will have access to more charging options, especially DC fast chargers, allowing greater confidence to travel to even more destinations,"" the automaker said.

Through the Toyota and Lexus apps, the company stated that customers will have access to an extensive charging network, comprising over 84,000 charging ports in North America, including level 2 and DC fast chargers.

BMW recently announced that it would adopt the standard for all of its EVs in the US and Canada.

General Motors (GM) and Ford announced a few months ago that the transition would begin in 2025, but owners will be able to access Tesla Superchargers with an adopter as early as next year.

Hyundai will use the port for its EVs in the US starting in 2024, with EVs in Canada following in 2025. Honda announced its transition to NACS in September, as well as its intention to sell vehicles with the port within two years.

European carmaker Volvo also signed an agreement with Tesla in June to provide current and future electric Volvo car drivers access to 12,000 Tesla's vast Supercharger network across the US, Canada and Mexico.

In February, the US administration revealed new initiatives to install 5,00,000 electric vehicle chargers on US roads by 2030 under its $7.5 billion plan, and as part of it, Tesla has committed to opening up 7,500 of its charging stations to non-Tesla vehicles by the end of 2024.

Under-pricing one's competitors is a double-edged sword. Sure, Tesla's series of electric vehicle (EV) price cuts sparked a price war and helped it maintain its dominant market share. It also put tremendous pressure on EV-industry rivals like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), which has struggled to compete against the much bigger and better-capitalized Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

However, it's been challenging to assess the full impact of Tesla's price-reduction strategy . The company's delivery numbers in China disappointed Wall Street, and Tesla did actually lose some of its market share recently.

Yet, the true litmus test of Tesla's price-slashing strategy is its third-quarter 2023 results. They were released after the market closed on Oct. 18 and represented one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases of the year.

Now we come to the billion-dollar question. After implementing 6%-or-greater price reductions across the company's EV models in just the third quarter, was Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tactic a hit or a miss? As usual, the answer is complicated but nonetheless contains insights into the seemingly never-ending war for EV-market dominance.

ShowTesla earnings reaction: Fear, front-running and reliefMargin issues show up in the numbersWill the Cybertruck be a blockbuster or a bust? Tesla earnings reaction: Fear, front-running and relief

In the 2020s, the financial markets have become so efficient that they price in events before they even happen. At least, that's what it felt like as TSLA stock dropped nearly 5% during the Oct. 18 trading session - before the company had even released its quarterly earnings results.

Granted, the stock market as a whole was in the red that day. Still, it felt like short-term traders expected disappointing third-quarter results from Tesla. Perhaps the aforementioned China-delivery data is what kept so many investors on edge.

However, a more likely explanation is that traders were bracing for a sizable margin decline. After all, that's the drawback of deep price cuts. A company will sell more products, but the profits per sale will be reduced.

Thus, analysts expected Tesla to report a Q3 2023 gross margin of 18.02% , versus 25.1% in the year-ago quarter and 18.2% in the second quarter. As it turned out, Tesla's actual gross margin for the third quarter was 17.9% , a slight miss but nothing catastrophic.

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out .

Sometimes good enough really is good enough. Despite all of the pre-earnings fear and loathing, TSLA stock as much as 1.5% in after-hours trading as traders weighed the company's non-disastrous profit margins.

Margin issues show up in the numbers

However, investors shouldn't take the wrong message from all of this. Clearly, Tesla's shrinking margins took a toll on its top- and bottom-line results.

Tesla's Q3 revenue of $23.35 billion fell short of the analysts' consensus estimate of $24.06 billion . Moreover, the company posted adjusted net income of $2.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 66 cents, missing Wall Street's consensus calls for $2.56 billion and 74 cents, respectively.

Hence, the seemingly almighty Tesla just broke its long-standing streak of quarterly EPS meets or beats . It just goes to show that even an industry dominator like Tesla can falter from time to time.

Did Tesla really falter? It's encouraging at least that the company reaffirmed its 2023 goal of producing 1.8 million vehicles. On the other hand, producing EVs isn't the same as selling them. There's also still the question of whether Tesla will generate decent profit margins on the vehicles it sells during the current quarter.

Will the Cybertruck be a blockbuster or a bust?

Then there's the Cybertruck. This is Musk's oddball invention, shaped like a spaceship and not really a truck by any conventional definition. Yet, it's a Tesla product, so it could conceivably be a game changer.

Deliveries of the Cybertruck are still on track for later this year, but the more normal-looking and reasonably priced Model Y and Model 3 EVs are undoubtedly Tesla's bread and butter. For the time being, the Cybertruck remains a show-me story for Tesla.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas apparently hasn't observed blockbuster demand for Tesla's angular EV.

'Cybertruck - very little enthusiasm on Tesla's next model,' Jonas reported .

Moreover, by the morning of Oct. 19, TSLA stock was in the red. This may have occurred because Musk warned that the Cybertruck will not be profitable until 2025 .

Again, the Cybertruck is just the icing on the cake for Tesla - not the cake itself. Now it's a question of whether Musk will persist with his price-cutting path for Tesla's most popular EV models.

Musk is unpredictable, so we'll just have to wait and see. For the time being, Tesla's stockholders can breathe a sigh of relief - assuming they didn't dump their shares pre-earnings.

Tuesday, the 
Travis County Commissioners Court
 approved Tesla's $750,000 community investment plan, to go toward community partners like the Austin Area Urban League, Colorado River Alliance, and Del Valle ISD, as the 
Tesla Gigafactory
, the second-largest factory building in the world, prepares to release its Cybertruck. 
 
A 
presentation
 from Tesla staff touted the many investments the company has already made in the local economy and workforce, much to the approval of commissioners. 
Commissioner Brigid Shea
 noted that 'some people aren't really all that excited about the richest man in the world getting these tax exemptions, but I think it's important for people to understand what was there previously was a sand and gravel pit. And what Travis County got in property taxes from them was $642. So I'll take the $15 million in property taxes over $642 – and all of the jobs, economic benefit, and improvement in people's lives.' 
That economic benefit amounts to nearly $2.2 billion paid to Travis County suppliers in 2022 alone, plus $15 million in property taxes to Travis County over the last three years, and just over $49 million to 
Del Valle Independent School District
. Tesla funds several workforce training programs, like the P-TECH (Pathways in Technology Early College High) program at Del Valle High School, which provides students with four to five years of training culminating in a manufacturing certificate, an associate degree from ACC, and an opportunity to work at Tesla.
 
They also partner with ACC to offer training programs to high school grads and people with GEDs, during which they are paid as Tesla employees and receive full benefits, and can choose to work for Tesla at the end. Staff report that many do: 'We've had a very good turnover rate from students to full-time employees.' Since the program's start last year, new hires from area high schools have climbed from 50 to 200, from Del Valle, Bastrop, Elgin, Manor, and Austin.
 
One of the main stipulations from the county for Tesla to receive tax abatements in 2020 was the target of hiring 5,000 Travis County residents, which the manufacturer has far overshot. There are now upward of 15,000 jobs created and counting – 10,000 actual Tesla factory employees. 
 
As 
Elon Musk
's properties have continued to skirt environmental regulation 
elsewhere
 in Texas (namely the 
Boring Co.
 in Bastrop), many have had questions about the Gigafactory's environmental impact, especially 
water usage
, here in Travis County. Staff gave an update on Musk's promised 'ecological paradise,' manifesting in a 120-acre pilot project for ecological restoration on a stretch of land between SH 130 and FM 973, west of the factory. The previous sand and gravel operation that the land was used for has made planting difficult, but with the help of compost the soil has been revitalized enough to now house 30-plus species of trees, 5,000 native plant species, and over 2,000 wetland plants in shallow water zones. Tesla has also removed 50 acres of invasive species and planted wildflowers.
 
Tesla again did not have exact numbers when Commissioner Shea asked about water usage for the entire factory, so the previous estimate of 600 million gallons a year still stands – though staff noted that as production ramps up that is likely to change (read: increase). The factory does use treated wastewater from Austin Water, and is planning to build more reclaimed water lines to feed the factory building. Cooling systems are also fed by a massive rainwater capture system that collects what rain does fall (not much lately) from the roof and directs it to 500,000-gallon-capacity storage tanks which are then redirected to cooling the offices and the equipment used to make the Cybertrucks. Tesla estimates that system saves about 8 million to 10 million gallons of water a year, but again: With what rain? 
 
'The city of Austin's main water supply has been declining because there's so little flow in any of the contributing streams that feed into Lake Travis. And there's a growing demand,' noted Shea, urging Tesla to do 'anything that can be done to reuse water in your manufacturing process. It would be really useful to understand what other kinds of things that you're doing internally that would reduce the overall demand for water, because it's going to be such a huge problem in the region.'

633,First Woman To Lead Germany's Biggest Union Takes Aim At Tesla,MENAFN,2023-10-21 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107281073/First-Woman-To-Lead-Germanys-Biggest-Union-Takes-Aim-At-Tesla,menafn.com,Bloomberg The incoming first female head of Germany's most powerful labor union IG Metall is warning Elon Musk about efforts to avoid unioniz,"(MENAFN- The Peninsula) Bloomberg

The incoming first female head of Germany's most powerful labor union IG Metall is warning Elon Musk about efforts to avoid unionization at his Tesla Inc. factory near Berlin.

""You need to be careful. The rules of the game are different here,' said Christiane Benner, who is set to take the helm of the union on Monday at its general assembly in Frankfurt.

The warning is a shot across the bow for Musk, whose factory churns out the popular Model Y - Europe's best-selling car earlier this year - and has so far refused to sign the kind of wage agreements that are standard in Germany, putting the company on a collision course with Benner.

IG Metall has the power to initiate walkouts at some of Germany's biggest firms, including Airbus, Siemens, Volkswagen and other titans of industry. Wage negotiations for its 3.9 million workers are closely watched by European Central Bank due to their potential impact on inflation.

While Tesla's 12,000-employee plant is a key concern, Benner, speaking in an interview with Bloomberg News, outlined a broad set of worrying developments putting pressure on Germany's workers.

Weaker demand from China, higher interest rates and the lingering fallout from last year's energy crisis have already caused some factories to close and others to shift production abroad. The economy is forecast to shrink this year. At the same time, the transition to renewable energy and other emerging technologies are requiring workers to have new sets of skills.

""Things are very turbulent at the moment,' Benner said. ""Re-qualification is going to be very important.'

IG Metall is Europe's biggest manufacturing union, representing workers on automaker assembly lines, steelmaking mills and other factories. The organization takes in about €500 million in annual membership fees and has repeatedly caused stoppages at Germany's most famous firms. With its vast membership, the organization holds considerable political clout.

Benner, 55, argues that German politicians have been too slow in tackling the country's structural issues, putting at risk workers in industries like auto production, which employs roughly 800,000 people.

A growing number of auto-industry workers in and outside of Germany are demanding better pay and job security in the shift to electric vehicles. The United Auto Workers union has launched a major strike targeting General Motors, Ford and Stellantis in the US, halting output at several factories. The concern is that EVs, which require fewer moving parts and workers to make, will cost jobs and reduce wages.

In Germany, growing voter frustration has fueled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany - known as the AfD - which Benner sees as a threat to the country's push to reset its manufacturing base for the green economy. The party, which gained in recent state elections in Bavaria and Hesse, has objected to technologies such as heat pumps, undermining efforts to attract investors and establish industrial clusters for manufacturing the machines. And its avowedly anti-immigrant position threatens to worsen Germany's longstanding worker shortage.

""People need confidence. They need a plan and they need to see strategies. They need strong unions,' Benner said. ""We see it as our role to push back against this political fragmentation and polarization.'

Her rise at the overwhelmingly male IG Metall is remarkable. And alongside Volkswagen works council chief Daniela Cavallo, who is leading the fight against painful cutbacks, it reflects a broader shift in Germany's traditionally male-dominated workers' leadership.

German rules requires 50% employee representation on the supervisory boards of large corporations - a requirement some have blamed for slow restructuring at troubled firms like Volkswagen and Thyssenkrupp AG. Benner disagrees.

""We can see that when we really push things and present good concepts to companies and governments, good things happen,' Benner said.

That's the message she aims to deliver to Tesla, where more than 1,000 staff showed up at the EV-maker's plant in Gruenheide near Berlin earlier this month wearing stickers calling for ""safe and fair work,' IG Metall said. Tesla employees are complaining about poor conditions and safety hazards, including extreme workloads due to staff shortages and overly ambitious production targets, according to the union. Tesla said the plant has regular checks by local authorities and that safety measures were being respected, according to Reuters.

Benner hopes to sit down soon with the world's richest man.

""Elon, what's the problem?' Benner said. ""I'm so friendly, I'll bring cookies.'",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/21/TP_85eb8image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.6692033,94412c8681e951e027c7885fb9965688

The US regulator asked Tesla to recall the cars as the vehicle controller is'likely to fail to detect low brake fluid and not display a warning light', reports Reuters.

The electric car company has already released an over-the-air (OTA) software update to fix the problem.

""Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths that may be related to this condition,' according to the NHTSA.

In August, the NHTSA started investigating approximately 280,000 Tesla vehicles (Model 3 and Model Y) over reports of loss of steering control while driving.

The malfunctioning in Tesla cars has frequently been accompanied by driver-facing messages indicating that power steering assist is reduced or disabled, reported CNBC.

The NHTSA received 12 complaints alleging loss of steering control and power steering in the vehicles.

A Model Y owner complained that the'wheel jerked hard right and made a thud'.

Tesla is currently facing several defect investigations by the NHTSA.

Tesla in July recalled nearly 16,000 of its 2021-2023 Model S and Model X vehicles in the US because some front-row seat belts may not have been reconnected properly after being repaired. T

esla also announced the recall of over 1,300 of its 2023 Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles due to a camera issue.

In June, Tesla recalled 137 Model Y electric vehicles (EVs) in the US in response to an issue with the fastener for the steering wheel.

Gavin Newsom is trying to keep the cross-border EV trade dream alive.,"With help from Wes Venteicher and Alex Nieves
































































TESLA TIME:
 At the national level, trade tensions with China appear to be escalating, with clean energy in the crosshairs. Not so in Newsom-world.
'We need China and China needs us,' 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
 told reporters after his meeting Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. 'We need to get our economy moving again, ... and China will play a role in that.'
Bilateral trade ties have been steadily fraying as Washington has been tightening export restrictions on semiconductors, limiting investment in Chinese tech and imposing domestic-content requirements on Chinese-made goods. China announced last week that it would limit exports of graphite, a key component of electric vehicle batteries, following its 
curtailment of gallium and germanium
 in August.
But in California, the picture for trade looks a bit more rosy. Newsom has been consistent throughout his trip to China in his line of strengthening economic ties, direct investment and trade.
That may be because of California's close existing ties with China. Major California companies like Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Tesla — as well as Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital — all have operations in China and are deeply financially enmeshed.
'It's been a win for both sides,' said 
Michael Dunne
, an auto industry consultant with expertise in electric vehicles and China. 'Even though overall the U.S.-China relationship is at its worst in 50 years, China is hoping to sort of carve out a special relationship with the state of California.'
This weekend, Newsom will be visiting Tesla's Shanghai factory, which produces over half the company's sales. Tesla, the second-largest EV company in the world behind BYD, is the only foreign car company in China to have a wholly owned manufacturing operation that isn't a joint venture with the government.
Chinese officials use Tesla as a retort to U.S. complaints that China isn't providing American companies a level playing field, according to 
Cory Combs
, a policy analyst at the consulting firm Trivium China.
'They point back to that and say, ‘Look, you can succeed here, you just need to play by our rules,'' he said.
It's true, says Combs, that 'Tesla has enjoyed the same industrial policy benefits as Chinese-led automakers such as preferential rates on land and taxation.' Tesla is also one of the companies subject to the recently announced 
European probe
 into Chinese EV-industry subsidies.
Tesla has long been a link between the U.S. and Chinese EV industries, according to 
Ilaria Mazzocco
, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The company has helped expand supply chains and popularize EVs among Chinese consumers.
But it's increasingly standing on shaky ground.
'I think Tesla, like many other companies, is finding that what used to be a very profitable position, in the midst of highly integrated U.S.-China supply chains is now increasingly a source of headaches and political risk,' she said.

READING THE TEA LEAVES:
 California leapfrogged over the feds earlier this month with Newsom's signing of two laws to require big companies to disclose their emissions and climate-related business risks.
But the SEC is still thinking about scaling back its ambition, which could hurt California's attempts to enforce its own rules.
SEC Chair 
Gary Gensler
 hinted in remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce today that he might drop a requirement to disclose Scope 3 emissions from his pending rule, 
Jordan Wolman and Declan Harty report
.
The Wall Street Journal 
pointed out today
 that if the SEC doesn't match California, it could empower industry to lobby lawmakers in Sacramento to water down its reporting regime. (Remember: The California Chamber of Commerce and Newsom himself have both said the reporting law needs '
cleanup
.')
'I'm hopeful if the SEC does take out Scope 3, … California will recognize that the SEC spent a lot more time looking at this than the legislators did, and it doesn't make sense to have Scope 3 in,' 
Travis Cushman
, deputy general counsel at the American Farm Bureau Association, told the WSJ.
Environmental groups 
came out with a report
 today aimed at getting the SEC to stay strong. It says 75 percent of Fortune 1000 companies will already need to comply with California's rules, so there's not a huge cost to including Scope 3 in the federal rules.
Gensler did say Thursday that the California laws, along with disclosure requirements out of Brussels, could change the cost-benefit analysis of the SEC's rule since more companies will need to make their climate information public regardless of the agency's rule.
 
































































GREAT WALL
: On Wednesday, the California delegation participated in a Great Wall Climate Dialogue in Beijing. In a large conference room filled with long tables, vice governors and their delegations from five Chinese provinces shared progress toward their climate goals and areas for collaboration.
Fang Wei
, vice governor of Jiangsu province, where Newsom will visit tomorrow, noted that his province had 200 plants working with Apple and Tesla, including 90 percent of Tesla's Chinese suppliers. (This is separate from Xianjing province in the west of China, where reports have exposed forced labor of Muslim Uyghurs in mines that provide minerals for Tesla's EV supply chain).
After the dialogue, Newson got to visit the Great Wall and ride a toboggan down the side of it in the tradition of Michelle Obama when she visited in 2014. Unlike during his visit to Disneyland, he didn't get to cut the line.
































EV EXPRESS:
 Newsom announced today that California is putting $40 million in federal money on the street for EV chargers. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act money is for 270 fast chargers at 26 sites that will be part of a federal charging network with chargers every 50 miles. California expects to receive a total of about $384 million in total from the federal fund over five years.
Some context: California recently met a goal set by former Gov. Jerry Brown to install 10,000 fast chargers, but the state is 
a year behind
 on an Energy Commission goal of reaching 250,000 public and shared-private chargers by 2025, thanks in part to protracted local permitting processes, long waits to connect new chargers to the grid and supply chain issues. The agency has estimated it needs that many chargers to support the state's plan to require that 100 percent of new cars sold in California be EVs by 2035.
The CEC is planning to expand the data it collects on each charger beginning in January in an effort to get a clearer picture of how chargers are used and how reliable they are. EV charging companies, site hosts and utilities will have to report data (private chargers and those serving apartments of four units or less are exempt). Charging companies and utilities are protesting the added burden in an 
agency proceeding
.
WE WANT LITHIUM:
 One of the recipients of a $1 million Energy Department award for lithium extraction is hoping to deploy its technology at the Salton Sea.
Ohio-based Xerion Advanced Battery Corp. announced the award from the DOE's Geothermal Lithium Extraction Prize today.
The company's technology uses a ceramic membrane to filter lithium from geothermal brine that's pumped from beneath the Salton Sea region to power steam turbines. The prize comes after the team won a two-year lithium extraction competition.
Geothermal energy producers like Berkshire Hathaway and Controlled Thermal Resources are 
still trying to crack the code
 on direct lithium extraction, which would allow them to tap into world's largest known lithium brine deposit. Aquifers near the Salton Sea are estimated to contain enough lithium to supply around 40 percent of global demand. DLE technology has not yet been used at a commercial scale.
































BENIPAL OUT:

Amarjeet Benipal
, director of Caltrans' District 3 office and a veteran with more than 30 years at the agency, is 
stepping down at the end of the year
, the agency confirmed Thursday. 
Jeanie Ward-Waller, Caltrans' former deputy director of planning and modal programs, was demoted in September. She said it was because she had warned her superiors that the agency — District 3 in particular — was breaking state and federal law by separating projects into small enough segments to avoid doing full analyses of their environmental impacts.

Tesla mechanics in Sweden walked off the job on Friday to protest against the electric carmaker's refusal to sign a collective wage agreement, the metalworkers union said.

The strike affects around Tesla's 130 mechanics at seven workshops across Sweden, IF Metall union spokesman Jesper Pettersson told AFP.

Pettersson said Tesla employees had ""lower wages, don't have the same insurances, and have lower pensions"" than other industry workers.

Negotiated sector-by-sector, collective agreements are the basis of the Swedish labour market model, covering almost 90 percent of all Swedish employees and guaranteeing standard wages and working conditions.

IF Metall -- which has some 300,000 members -- said the agreements also allow for companies ""to operate on a level playing field"".

""Many"" of Tesla's workers in Sweden are members of IF Metall, Pettersson said, but would not disclose an exact number.

Despite being union members, they cannot benefit from industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.

Pettersson said Tesla informed them Tuesday it would not sign a collective bargaining agreement, adding that the carmaker told the union they ""don't do that anywhere in the world.""

Tesla has not responded to AFP's request for comment.

Tesla founder and chief Elon Musk has consistently rejected calls to allow the company's 127,000 employees worldwide to unionise.

Tesla strikers in Sweden were being paid compensation by the union equivalent to their wages, Pettersson said.

He said that unless Tesla changed its position, IF Metall would widen its strike on November 3 to cover all workshop repairs on Tesla cars across Sweden, not just those done by Tesla employees.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/27/AFP_528e5image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.359495,3ee957c463877731476a11ccc9fc2d67

 Tesla (","(MENAFN- ValueWalk) (Free Video) The 2 Secrets To Finding Small-Cap, Hidden Gem Stock Opportunities To Dramatically Grow Your Portfolio in Q4.





Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected results for its third quarter , sending its shares lower. The electric vehicle (EV) maker lost as much as 15.6% last week to hit the lowest levels in nearly 5 months.

This way, Tesla recorded the weakest weekly performance this year, playing in the hands of bears who were continuously warning about the stock's rich valuation. Tesla stock is up over 72% year-to-date, despite FY 23 earnings declining from ~$6 a year ago to <$3.

Prior to last week's selloff, Tesla shares traded at ~200x trailing TTM FCF, or ~400x TTM FCF, excluding EV credits. At these levels, Tesla stock was always poised to correct lower in case the company failed to clear the Q3 earnings bar. The P/E ratio now sits around 60, down from about 75 seen earlier in October.

Tesla stock now trades near $210 – which is a key near-term support. It is likely that the stock will bounce from these levels, however, it could first move to $206 where the 100 monthly moving average is located.

ShowHow Tesla Performed in Q3Aggressive Price Cuts to Spur DemandConclusion How Tesla Performed in Q3

Tesla shares whipsawed after the release of a report. Initially, they surged by 2.4% in after-hours trading following the report but later dropped more than 4% on comments from CEO Elon Musk, who cautioned on the earnings call that the company's Cybertruck would not generate significant positive cash flow for 12 to 18 months after production commences.

'It is going to require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford,' with the Cybertruck.

'I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product, but financially, it will take a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor.'

Tesla announced on X that the production of the Cybertruck remains on schedule for later this year, with the first deliveries planned for November 30th at Giga Texas. The company also said that Cybertruck is currently in'pilot production,' and the Texas factory has the capacity to manufacture up to 125,000 units per year.

In the meantime, Musk emphasized that Tesla's primary focus is on making its cars more affordable, particularly in a high-interest rate environment. As Tesla aims to make EVs more accessible to the public, some buyers remain wary of the 'unforseen' costs.

For instance, car insurance for EVs tends to be more expensive than that of traditional cars, which can play a notable role in the total cost of ownership. This is why, in September 2023, Tesla launched its own initiative to help lower car insurance rates. With this context in the clear, let's take a closer look at Tesla's performance in Q3.

Tesla delivered a soft Q3 performance with the earnings per share coming in at just 66 cents, missing the market expectations of 73 cents . Revenue jumped 9% year-over-year to $23.35 billion, up from $21.45 billion reported for the same period last year. However, analysts were looking for $24.1 billion.

Even more concerningly, Tesla generated just $848 million in Q3 cash flow while analysts were looking for as much as $2.59 billion. Tesla's third-quarter gross margin also experienced a decrease compared to the previous year, coming in at 17.9%, therefore missing the consensus by 10 basis points.

For the same period last year, Tesla reported gross margins of 25.1% while the Q2 number stood at 18.2%. Tesla reported $19.63 billion in automotive revenue while generating $1.56 billion in revenue from its energy generation and storage business.

Non-adjusted net income amounted to $1.85 billion, while the total gross profit witnessed a 22% decline when compared to the same period in the previous year. More worryingly, the total operating margin for the current quarter stood at 7.6%, signifying a significant decrease from the figure of 17.2% recorded in the year-ago quarter.

'Our cost of goods sold per vehicle decreased to ~$37,500 in Q3. While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions,' the company said .

Tesla is now focused on bringing the prices of its EV models lower before it goes'full-tilt' on the Mexico gigafactory. Commenting on the earnings call, Musk said that the company is'laying the groundwork to begin construction.

'I'm worried about the high interest rate environment we're in... If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car,' Musk commented.

'I just can't emphasize enough how important the cost is...We have to make our products more affordable so people can buy it.'

Tesla shareholders and a long-time bull, Gene Muster, said the company had'a challenging September quarter.' Speaking to CNBC, Muster said the Q3 report was'a disappointment .'

Aggressive Price Cuts to Spur Demand

Shrinking margins are a direct result of the electric automaker's significant price reductions and discounts since January as part of the strategy to stimulate demand, particularly in light of higher interest rates.

Tesla has embarked on a campaign marked by aggressive price cuts, sacrificing margins to increase demand for its EV models. More recently, Tesla stock declined as price cuts were announced , involving its Model 3 and Model Y versions in the United States at the beginning of October.

Tesla's latest drop came shortly after the company's third-quarter deliveries missed analyst expectations. The EV maker is currently striving to deliver a record 476,000 vehicles in the last three months of 2023 to meet its annual target of delivering 1.8 million vehicles.

The stock tends to drop on every new round of price cuts amid concerns that these are impacting the company's industry-leading margins. In the April-June quarter, Tesla's margins reached a nearly four-year low.

Based on the latest prices, the standard Model 3 sedan now costs $1,250 less at $38,990 , while the Model Y long-range variant has a reduced price of $48,490, as shown on Tesla's website. Throughout the year, the standard Model 3 has seen a cumulative price reduction of approximately 17%, and the Model Y long-range variant has experienced a decrease of over 26%.

It could be that Elon Musk and his team also wanted to ramp up pressure on the big three, which were hampered by exhausting and expensive negotiations with the union of workers over a new multi-year contract.

On the other hand, the fact that Tesla continues to put pressure on its margins with price cuts, some shareholders have been increasingly calling for the company to start spending on ads. At Tesla's annual shareholder meeting last May, Elon Musk faced investor pressure when a shareholder challenged him about the company's advertising practices.

Musk expressed openness to the idea of advertising Tesla's features to a broader audience. He acknowledged that there are remarkable features and functionalities in Teslas that many people are unaware of.

'I think what you are saying does have some merit, and I believe in taking suggestions, and we'll try a little advertising and see how it goes.'

Conclusion

The EV maker Tesla reported financial results that missed earnings expectations while CEO Musk provided a tempered outlook for its highly-awaited Cybertruck. This way, the Q3 report is likely to raise concerns among near-to-intermediate-term investors given Musk's comments about the difficult macroeconomic environment and another setback in the Cybertruck rollout.

Tesla stock fell more than 15% last week in response to the soft Q3 print and rising tensions in the Middle East. Net-net, the stock's valuation is now more balanced after a ~30% correction from YTD highs.

Sources told TOI that the central government is in talks with Tesla to bring it to India and the Gujarat government is taking support from the Centre to bring the project to Sanand-Bechraji region or Dholera. They added that Tesla may join hands with Indian auto brands.

Tesla Inc's chief Elon Musk had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York in June.

The sources added,'Gujarat is one of the most industrialised states and an automobile hub. We are taking help from the central government to bring the Tesla project to Gujarat during VGGS 2024.'

Top government sources said,'Talks with Tesla are at a nascent stage. We are trying to get this ambitious project to Gujarat which has emerged as an automobile hub. Gujarat aims to contribute maximum in realising the dream of making India a $5 trillion economy and projects like Tesla will play a significant role in it.'

Gujarat may offer land to Tesla in the Sanand-Bechraji region where Tata Motors and Suzuki have their auto plants. The region has good connectivity with ports, facilitating exports.

Sources further added that Dholera is also among the potential sites where Tesla could set up plant, provided all goes well.

Gujarat emerged as an automobile hub with the arrival of Tata Motors' ambitious Nano plant and since then, the state has seen arrival of auto companies like Ford Motors, whose plant was acquired by Tata Motors, and Suzuki. MG Motor also set up its only plant in India by acquiring General Motor's Halol plant.

The electric car-maker disclosed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that the Justice department issued subpoenas related to perks, vehicle range and personaldecisions.

'We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and various local, state, federal and international agencies,' Tesla said in its filing.

The company has received requests for information, including subpoenas, from the DOJ.

'These have included requests for documents related to Tesla's Autopilot and FSD features. Additionally, the company has received requests for information, including subpoenas from the DOJ, regarding certain matters associated with personal benefits, related parties, vehicle range and personnel decisions,' Tesla informed.

The company said that no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.

'We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand,' said Tesla.

The DOJ's inquiry into vehicle range came as reports surfaced earlier this year that the automaker had exaggerated the range estimates for its EVs for years.

The Reuters investigation, citing anonymous sources and industry experts, found that the directive to use algorithms to give rosier range numbers came from Musk.

Tesla's Shanghai plant is estimated to have delivered 72,000 vehicles in October, said the China Passenger Car Association on Thursday.
 
They brought the plant's deliveries in the first 10 months this year to exceed 771,000 units, more than the total in the whole year of 2022, said the CPCA.
 
Because of the growing demand, the production capacity of its Shanghai plant rose to 950,000 units in the third quarter from 750,000 units in the second quarter, said the carmaker.
 
The Shanghai plant produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, which are well received in the market.
 
The carmaker said deliveries of the new Model 3 have just started in China and overseas markets, with many of them on the way to destination countries.
 
California Governor Gavin Newsom visited the facility during his trip to China last week and test drove the new Model 3.

The American carmaker is targeting customers at the top end of India's growing mass-premium segment of EVs and does not want to be a luxury player competing for a small set of wealthy buyers, the people said.

BYD Co. is rapidly closing in on Tesla Inc. as the world's biggest seller of pure electric vehicles, with surging profits underscoring its sales clout despite intensifying competition at home.

Shares of the Hong Kong-listed Chinese electric-vehicle firm are up 1.7% this month, outperforming Tesla's 17% plunge and declines in other peers as well. While shares of Elon Musk's firm are still up by more than double the rise in BYD this year, signs are pointing to further gains for the latter.

Traders have snapped up bullish options on BYD, while analysts have raised their earnings projections for the Chinese company to a record high since its preliminary quarterly report this month.

BYD posted all-time high sales despite intensifying competition and a broader slowdown in sales of China's new-energy cars. The company will report its third-quarter earnings after Monday's close.

Musk cast a pall over the global EV sector with a grim outlook earlier this month, saying rising interest rates in the US have hurt its sales.

Tesla's results are also suffering from the months-long price war that it had initiated in an attempt to fuel demand. Analysts have been lowering their earnings-per-share estimates for the US maker at the same time the outlook for BYD has been rising.

""BYD still looks like the safest bet versus Tesla in the short term given its discipline in terms of balancing volume growth with profitability,' said Kevin Net, head of Asian equities at Tocqueville Finance.

""It also has growing exposure to hybrids, which have been gaining market share in China and contribute to higher margins.'



BYD sold a record total of 822,094 vehicles in the latest quarter, including hybrids, helping to cement its lead as China's best-selling car brand. What particularly surprised industry observers is that BYD seems to be making more money per vehicle, despite price competition.

Profit per car, excluding the impact of the company's electronics unit, rose as much as 46% versus the previous quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates. The analysts believe BYD can maintain its profitability into next year thanks to more sales of high-end vehicles as well as continued overseas expansion.

BYD is expected to start deliveries of its high-end Yangwang U8 and Fang Cheng Bao BAO 5 in the fourth quarter, according to pundits at HSBC Holdings PLC. Outside of China, BYD claims high shares in countries including Brazil, though tax and political considerations have kept it from entering the US passenger-car market.

The improving profit outlook has helped make BYD's stock more attractive, driving its forward earnings multiple down to about 18 times, compared with over 50 times for Tesla.

Recent options data also look positive, as the volatility skew has shifted toward the more bullish side compared with a month ago.

While BYD has been backed by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s selling of shares since last year may have weighed down its share price. Other headwinds for the shares include the European Union's anti-subsidies probe into EVs made in China.

(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden threw his support behind the United Auto Workers' efforts to unionize workers at Tesla Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. in the wake of the labor group's historic contract with Detroit's Big Three automakers.
 
'Absolutely,' Biden told reporters Thursday when asked if he is in favor of the organizing drive.
 
Biden is again backing the union's push for higher wages, benefits and larger membership. In the midst of the UAW's strike against the legacy automakers, Biden made an historic appearance at a picket line to endorse the labor group's demands.
 
The president spoke before traveling to Illinois for an event later Thursday to celebrate the contract, which saw the union secure record pay agreements with Stellantis NV, General Motors Co., and Ford Motor Co. after a six-week work stoppage that cost the auto industry billions of dollars.
 
UAW President Shawn Fain has said he wants to use momentum from the agreement to target non-union manufacturers such as Tesla and Toyota. Biden will meet Fain and other union figures Thursday in Belvidere, Illinois, where an idled Stellantis assembly plant will reopen under the terms of the contract.
 
Fain is taking on an ambitious task in trying to grow the union's membership, which is a fraction of what it was in its mid-20th century heyday. That dovetails with Biden's goal of reviving the US labor movement.
 
The UAW failed at previous organizing efforts at foreign-based automakers in the US, such as Volkswagen AG. Tesla, though, offers a prominent target for the union. The company employs tens of thousands of non-union workers across states including California, Texas, Nevada and New York, and is the leading US electric automaker. One of the union's concerns is that the transition to electric vehicles will shrink its ranks and lower pay.
 
Fain has expressed optimism the union can take on Tesla and its anti-union Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk following its recent wins.
 
'We can beat anybody,' Fain said in an interview last week with Bloomberg News. 'It's gonna come down to the people that work for him deciding if they want their fair share,' he added. 'I believe it's doable.'
 
Mobilizing rank-and-file union voters next year will be crucial to Biden's reelection prospects. Biden formally launched his 2024 campaign earlier this year at a rally with union groups, signaling their importance to his campaign.
 
The UAW endorsed Biden in his 2020 campaign but has not yet offered their formal support for his reelection bid. Fain praised Biden's appearance on the picket line but has pushed Democrats and the White House to be more supportive of the union and labor movement.
 
'They're going to be fine,' Biden said when asked whether he would bring up an endorsement with Fain.",stripes.com,3181,news,US,en,,https://www.stripes.com/incoming/busd7o-p20230926as-0441_(53235060354).jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/P20230926AS-0441_53235060354.jpg,False,@starsandstripes,8.474575,165cfaddc6683d94626de917a10bf79e

AITO M7 SUV has received more than 80,000 orders within the first 50 days after its launch in China on September 12, exceeding the two partners' expectations, according to AITO, a unit of Huawei and Seres. The M7 offers three options with a starting price of 249,800 yuan (US$34,434), 284,800 yuan and 309,800 yuan. Huawei has reportedly committed 1 billion yuan (US$136.5 million) of additional investment to guarantee delivery of the M7.

AITO, which refers to'Adding Intelligence to Auto,' was formerly known as Huawei AITO until April this year. Its EVs use Huawei's in-car operating system Harmony OS.

AITO also said that its next model, M9, which will be ready for sale next month, has received 15,000 pre-sale orders.



But a favorable market response, in this case, does not equate to financial success for all concerned – yet, at least. In the three years ended last year, Seres has already reported a combined net loss of 9.7 billion yuan. Besides, Seres is also facing rising competition from Huawei's other business partners, including Xiaopeng and JAC Motors.

The problem, an auto expert say s, is that the net profit on an EV priced at around 300,000 yuan is about 35,000 yuan. He says that under its profit-sharing model, Seres can only make about 3,000 yuan while the rest all goes to Huawei, which contributes software and high-end electronic parts.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/07/AT_a2355image_story.png,False,@menafn,8.10853,1b2d4c1d008d75964d8a1e091425740a

Tesla Inc. is taking steps to begin operations in Chile, a country with the world's biggest reserves of lithium but still low penetration of electric vehicles.
 
The company registered Tesla Chile SpA, according to a post on Chile's official gazette dated September 28. The unit can carry out activities such as the sale and fabrication of cars and those related to 'generation of energy and electricity.'
 
The electric-vehicle juggernaut also is recruiting for three positions in the capital Santiago, including for a country manager 'to help launch the market', according to postings on LinkedIn.
 
To be sure, registering for business activities doesn't necessarily mean Tesla will go forward with these plans, but it does pave a legal path to do so.
 
A team from Tesla visited lithium extraction sites and an energy storage project in Chile in February, according to the company's impact report. 'These trips focused on questions related to water usage, indigenous peoples' rights and the use of new technologies, such as Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE), to extract lithium in a more efficient way that reduces land use, water use and energy use,' Tesla said. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles.
 
Tesla would join its biggest electric-vehicle rival, BYD Co., in Chile. The Chinese firm last month launched its Seal sedan in Santiago as part of a push into Latin America. BYD has plans for a cathode factory in Chile after being granted access to preferential prices for lithium mined by SQM.
 
Tesla would face the same barriers that other electric-vehicle sellers have faced in the region. EVs are on average 2.5 times more expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles, according to BloombergNEF. EV sales accounted for only 2.5% of total vehicle sales in the first nine months of the year, according to Chile's car association.
 
A search on Telsa's website only shows job openings in Mexico and Chile and no presence in South America. Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced in March that Tesla would build a new plant in Monterrey, the company's first factory south of the US border.
 
Chile also has some of the world's best conditions for renewable energy generation, with sun-drenched deserts in the north and strong winds in the south. However, the country's renewable energy boom has been hamstrung by transmission bottlenecks and a lack of storage.

According to the reports, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) held a meeting on Monday with top officials to review the upcoming phase of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in the country, including Tesla's investment proposal.

The Union Ministries of Commerce and Industry, Heavy Industry, and Electronics and Information Technology have been engaged in discussions about Tesla's plans in India, following a meeting between Musk and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the latter's state visit to the US in June.

In September, a report said that Tesla is planning to build a factory for battery storage in India and has submitted a proposal for the same to the government.

The electric car-maker proposed supporting the country's battery storage capabilities with its'Powerwall"" during recent meetings.

Musk is also aiming to build a Tesla supply system in India.

The EV major is planning to source automobile parts worth up to $1.9 billion this year from India, Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said.

The minister said that last year, Tesla had already bought $1 billion worth of components from India and this year their target is $1.7-$1.9 billion.

 First and foremost, one should mention if said 
Tesla
 is a Plaid or not – because there's a whole world of difference between an affordable Tesla Model 3 and the 1,020-hp Plaid Model S or Model X. Secondly, not any 
ICE
-powered car will go down without a fight. And there is no need to take our word for granted as we have a lovely couple of examples to illustrate just that. 
 The videographer behind the 
Wheels Plus
 channel on YouTube is a big fan of Bandimere Speedway and Mission Raceway Park, mainly because of their ICE vs 
EV
 drag encounters. And on this occasion, he bundled a couple of white Tesla Model 3 EV sedans with two interesting opponents – a Porsche (presumably a 911 GT3 RS) and an Audi TT RS.
 
 The first skirmish – between an aero-enhanced Tesla Model 3 and a blue Porsche 911, occurred at 
MRP
 – the auto racing facility located in Mission, British Columbia, Canada, which houses a two-kilometer nine-turn road course, a three-kilometer motocross track, and also an NHRA-sanctioned quarter-mile dragstrip. On it, the Tesla and Porsche looked ready to duke it out for all eternity, and this sure was a close brawl.
 
 In the end, the electronic scoreboard showed the Porsche had an ET of 11.37s at 122 mph (196 kph) while the feisty-looking Tesla Model 3 only managed an 11.71s at 104 mph (167 kph), but the track's light gave it the victory, nonetheless. If you're feeling robbed, just like the Porsche driver, no worries. We can switch to 
Bandimere Speedway
 – also known in the NHRA as Thunder Mountain due to its high elevation, which is located outside Morrison and Lakewood, Colorado.
 Over there, another Tesla Model 3 received the visit of an aggressive Audi TT RS (unfortunately, its days are numbered) and probably decided to avenge all ICE-powered vehicles that suffered at the sight of better ETs of Tesla vehicles. As such, the TT RS consistently pulled away from the get-go – slowly but steadily gaining leverage on the EV opponent in the left lane. In the end, that 10.97s versus 11.77s victory was pretty sweet, indeed. 
 Anyway, suppose you want to see more ICE-powered action. In that case, we recommend switching to the second video embedded below – where cvdzijden, the guy with supercar videos, caught a crazy distribution: an army-green BMW M5 Competition tuned to 740 ponies raced a 950-hp Nissan GT-R. So, which action is more remarkable – ICE versus EV or all vehicles with internal combustion engines?",autoevolution.com,5202,news,RO,en,Aurel Niculescu,https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-drags-porsche-and-audi-someone-pulls-away-and-another-is-robbed-of-victory-223993_1.jpg,False,@_autoevolution_,7.4742146,605c311f441106c76cf4f667ab30aba3

This move comes in the wake of a high-level meeting at the Prime Minister's Office on Monday, during which the next phase of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in the country, including Tesla's investment proposal, was discussed.

While the meeting primarily focused on general policy matters, a top official revealed to ET that fast-tracking approvals for Tesla's proposed investment in the country by January 2024 was a prominent agenda item.



The Ministries of Commerce and Industry, Heavy Industry, and Electronics and IT have been engaged in discussions about Tesla's plans ever since CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the United States in June.

Senior Tesla executives have reportedly been in talks with the Indian government to establish car and battery manufacturing facilities in India, with the EV manufacturer expressing a keen interest in bringing its supply chain ecosystem to the country.



A second official disclosed to ET that various ministries and government departments have been instructed to resolve any differences with Tesla and expedite the announcement of the company's India manufacturing plan.

The electric vehicle bubble's bust continued after Rivian (RIVN) posted Q3 results. After losing half its value this summer, why did investors dump shares while Tesla (TSLA) was steady?

Rivian, an EV truck supplier, posted solid revenue growth, up an astounding 150% Y/Y to $1.34 billion. It still lost $1.19 a share on a non-GAAP measure. The figure adjusts the $3.911 billion loss by adding back $606 million in stock-based compensation and another $667 million in depreciation and amortization.

It burned through $1.067 billion in negative cash flow. This is better than the $1.666 billion last year.

Investors initially bid RIVN stock up when the firm announced it was formally ending its exclusivity agreement with Amazon (AMZN). This implies an increase in addressable market for its commercial sales. However, it also suggests that Amazon may buy EVs, hybrids, and non-EV vehicles from other suppliers. In addition, it removes any buyout premium.

Still, Rivian's ~$15 billion market capitalization is too big a cost for Amazon to absorb. It is currently awaiting approval to buy out Roomba vacuum supplier iRobot (IRBT) for nearly $52 a share. Last week, the stock traded at a $797 million market capitalization ($28.60). Markets doubt that Amazon will buy the firm.

Tesla is the winner in the EV space. It just cuts prices to protect its market share. The Cyber truck could pressure Rivian's business further.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/14/B_23bcfimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.84266,f6a3295518a4ee5c4eda803af46408b7

The move comes amid reports suggesting that India is actively encouraging the electric vehicle (EV) giant to establish a manufacturing plant within its borders.



Following a comprehensive tour of Tesla's facility, Minister Goyal took to social media, specifically X (formerly Twitter), to reveal that Tesla is ""on its way to double its components imports from India."" This statement aligns with Goyal's earlier announcement in September, where he indicated that Tesla aimed to source components valued at around USD1.9 billion from India in the current year, a significant increase from the USD1 billion recorded in 2022.



Expressing delight at witnessing Indian engineers and finance professionals in senior roles at Tesla, Goyal underscored their contributions to the company's ""remarkable"" journey. The visit to the Tesla factory is part of Goyal's broader tour of the United States, focusing on bolstering economic ties and encouraging investment in India's growing EV sector.



While Goyal was scheduled to meet Tesla CEO Elon Musk during the visit, Musk had to cancel due to health reasons. In response to Goyal's post, Musk extended an apology for his absence and acknowledged the Indian government's emphasis on attracting investments and expanding the output of EVs in the country, emphasizing the potential for ""economies of scale of new technologies.""



This development comes several months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Musk during his visit to the United States.

Photo / Kenny Holston, The New York Times
A day after Lukasz Krupski put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location in Norway, seriously burning his hands and preventing a disaster, he got an email from Elon Musk.
 
'Congratulations for saving
 
the day!' Musk, Tesla's CEO, wrote in March 2019.
 
But what started as a story about a heroic employee and a grateful employer has devolved into an epic battle between the carmaker and Krupski, a service technician. The fight has spawned lawsuits in Norway and the United States and caught the attention of regulators in several countries.
After initially being hailed as a saviour, Krupski said in an interview with 
The New York Times
 that he was harassed, threatened and eventually fired after complaining about what he considered grave safety problems at his workplace near Oslo.
Krupski, originally from Poland, was part of a crew that helped prepare Teslas for buyers, but became so frustrated with the company that last year he handed over reams of data from the carmaker's computer system to 
Handelsblatt
, a German business newspaper.
The data contained lists of Tesla employees, including Musk, often with their Social Security numbers and other personal information. There were thousands of accident reports and other internal Tesla communications that 
Handelsblatt
 used as the basis for stories about flaws with the company's Autopilot driver-assistance software.
The data also provided the basis for stories by 
Handelsblatt 
and 
Wired 
magazine about how much trouble Tesla was having manufacturing the Cybertruck pick-up, which the company has said will be delivered to customers at the end of this month, almost three years behind schedule. (Some of the information came from a second, unidentified Tesla employee.)
Krupski said he had gotten access to sensitive data simply by entering search terms in an internal company website, raising questions about how Tesla protected the privacy of thousands of employees and its own secrets.
The Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands, where Tesla has its European headquarters, is investigating whether the breach violated privacy laws. A spokesperson for the authority confirmed that it was investigating but declined to comment further.
Tesla and three lawyers representing the company did not reply to requests for comment.
In the United States, Benson Pai, a former Tesla production worker, has sued the automaker in federal court in California, claiming that lax security by Tesla exposed employee information that could be sold to criminals. Lawyers for Pai are seeking approval from a judge to pursue the case as a class action on behalf of tens of thousands of Tesla employees.

Krupski shared the data with Aaron Greenspan, a prominent Tesla critic and short-seller, who urged him to provide information he had collected about Autopilot to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The safety agency has had a long-running investigation into the software, which can steer, accelerate and stop a car on its own but requires a driver to be ready to take control at any moment. The agency has interviewed Krupski several times, he said, an indication that his information was taken seriously.
Greenspan said he had begun closing out his short positions in Tesla shortly after hearing from Krupski.
The US safety agency has confirmed that it is investigating whether Autopilot played a role in hundreds of accidents, some fatal, but declined to comment on any interactions with Krupski. Tesla has maintained that Autopilot makes cars safer and recently prevailed against a lawsuit that had claimed the software was responsible for a fatal crash in California.
Krupski and Greenspan also wrote a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising questions about Tesla's accounting practices, based in part on the data Krupski had collected. He said he did not know what the commission had done with the information.
The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.
Krupski remained anonymous until he spoke on the record to 
Handelsblatt 
last week.
In the interview with the 
Times
, Krupski, 38, said he was unemployed and had exhausted his savings. He has served Tesla with formal notice that he intends to sue for compensation, but cannot pursue the case further until he scrapes together enough money to pay a lawyer. Unlike lawyers in the United States, lawyers in Norway are not allowed to work on commission, collecting a share of any award if they win but nothing if they lose.
Tormod Tingstad, an Oslo lawyer, is representing Krupski free of charge while they try to raise money.
None of this could have been foreseen on March 30, 2019, when Krupski, who had been hired only a few months earlier, was part of a crew summoned on short notice to prepare Teslas for delivery to customers in Norway, where electric vehicles account for more than 80 per cent of new car sales.
Tesla, which sells cars directly to buyers, was using space in an exhibition hall near Oslo to deliver vehicles. Thousands of people were visiting a motor show in the same complex.

Around noon, a charging device that another employee had improperly modified burst into flames beneath a Model 3 sedan. Krupski yanked the device away and, with his bare hands, pulled out wiring, pipes and other components that were burning and melting. He used rags and towels to suffocate the flames.
'It is fair to say that if it wasn't for his action, the result would have been a car on fire,' Krupski's manager wrote in an email to Musk the next day. Krupski said the fire could have spread, endangering workers and customers waiting nearby and forcing evacuation of the motor show.
The only person seriously injured was Krupski, who was hospitalised with severe burns but has recovered.
After Musk congratulated Krupski, the technician replied with complaints about safety practices at Tesla's Norwegian operation. On the day of the fire, he wrote, there were no fire extinguishers, cardboard boxes and other flammable material were strewn about, and employees were not briefed about where they would be working.
'Okay, please let me know if there's anything we should still do,' Musk replied, according to a copy of the email included in legal documents prepared by Tingstad.
But Krupski's direct communications with the Tesla CEO did not sit well with his bosses in Norway. According to Krupski, his supervisor began questioning his performance and telling him he had no future at Tesla.
'Long story short, I am being fired,' Krupski wrote to Musk in late April 2019, less than four weeks after the fire. Musk replied, 'I can't read emails unless critical to Tesla.' That was the end of their correspondence.
In the months that followed, Krupski said, he was threatened and harassed by co-workers and exiled to a basement. One co-worker threatened to stab him in the back with a screwdriver, he said. Krupski and other workers were furloughed during the pandemic, and he missed work because of stress-related health problems. Then, in 2022, he was fired after being accused of bad behaviour and poor time management, and of being a negative influence.
His bosses also said Krupski had taken pictures at a Tesla facility, in violation of company policy. He said he had taken photos to document safety issues, which included use of a rolling table that employees put under a car when removing a battery. The table was designed to bear a maximum of 500 kilograms, Krupski said, while the batteries weighed substantially more. If a table collapsed, he said, workers could be seriously injured or killed.
In a letter to Krupski's lawyer, a Norwegian law firm representing Tesla said the company would dispute that he had been subject to retaliation. The letter accused Krupski of misappropriating company information and threatened to seek damages from him.
Tesla has obtained an injunction from a Norwegian court ordering Krupski not to distribute any more company information. The court also seized his laptop and turned it over to Tesla. The company notified employees of the data breach on August 18, about three months after it learned that 
Handelsblatt 
had the information.
Information including work email addresses, compensation and Social Security numbers might have been leaked, Tesla told employees in an email, but said: 'We have no evidence that any personal information was misused or will be used in a manner that could harm you.'
Krupski said that he had suffered from depression, anxiety and sleeplessness as a result of his battle with Tesla, but that he felt relieved to no longer be anonymous.
'I feel like just by going public I have a new rush of energy,' he said. 'I have motivation that, okay, I can maybe start building my life again.'

The controversial purchase clause appears to have been removed by the company from its updated terms and conditions for the forthcoming vehicle.

The news was first reported by Electrek.

Previously, in a section titled ""For Cybertruck Only"" to its Motor Vehicle Order Agreement, Tesla mentioned, ""You agree that you will not sell or otherwise attempt to sell the Vehicle within the first year following your Vehicle's delivery date"".

""Tesla may seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the Vehicle or demand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater. Tesla may also refuse to sell you any future vehicles,"" it added.

As of Tuesday morning, that section had been removed from the agreement.

However, it's unclear why Tesla reversed course on this restriction.

The Cybertruck, which was first announced in 2019, is Tesla's first new product in years, and it is expected to shake up the electric pickup-truck market.

Tesla initially stated that the truck would start at $39,900, but it is expected to be much more expensive due to expensive building materials.

The Cybertruck will hit the market at the end of the month.

Murati, who has a degree in mechanical engineering from Dartmouth College, previously worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs and French aerospace group Zodiac Aerospace.

She also worked at Elon Musk-run electric car company Tesla as a senior product manager of the Model X.

In 2016, Murati joined Leap Motion, a startup building hand- and finger-tracking motion sensors for PCs, as VP of product and engineering, reports TechCrunch.

In 2018, she came to OpenAI as VP of applied AI and partnerships.

After being promoted to CTO in 2022, she led the work on ChatGPT, the text-to-image AI DALL-E and the code-generating system Codex, which powers GitHub's Copilot product.

A member of OpenAI's leadership team for five years, Murati has played a critical role in OpenAI's evolution into a global AI leader.

She brings a unique skill set, understanding of the company's values, operations, and business, and already leads the company's research, product, and safety functions, said the company.

'Given her long tenure and close engagement with all aspects of the company, including her experience in AI governance and policy, the board believes she is uniquely qualified for the role and anticipates a seamless transition while it conducts a formal search for a permanent CEO,' said OpenAI.

Goyal posted on X that it was ""extremely delighted to see talented Indian engineers and finance professionals working at senior positions and contributing to Tesla's remarkable journey to transform mobility'.

'Also proud to see the growing importance of Auto component suppliers from India in the Tesla EV supply chain. It is on its way to double its components imports from India. Missed Elon Musk's magnetic presence and I wish him a speedy recovery,' the Union Minister added.

The Tesla owner however, apologised to Goyal for not being able to meet him as he was keeping unwell.

'It was an honour to have you visit Tesla! My apologies for not being able to travel to California today, but I look forward to meeting at a future date,' Musk replied.

Goyal and Musk were scheduled to meet during the Minister's US visit, months after the SpaceX and X owner met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US, and revealed he was keen to make significant investments in India.

According to a latest Financial Times report, citing sources, the automaker has asked the Indian government for an initial tariff concession that would offset India's steep customs duties of 70 per cent for cars under $40,000 and 100 per cent for cars above $40,000.

""Their view has always been that they need some tariff concessions at least in the interim period. It would have some kind of sunset clause,"" one of the officials was quoted as saying in the report.

Tesla had asked for the concession as a condition for constructing a plant in the country.

The reduced tariffs would apply to all EV manufacturers.

The officials stated that the reduced rate under consideration would be 15 per cent for EVs of all prices, but that the policy had not yet been agreed upon within the government, the report mentioned.

In September, reports surfaced that Tesla is planning to build a factory for battery storage in India and has submitted a proposal for the same to the government.

The electric car-maker proposed supporting the country's battery storage capabilities with its 'Powerwall' during recent meetings.

Musk is also aiming to build a Tesla supply system in India.

According to vehicle registration data from Experian, the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 were the two most registered EVs in the US between January and September, far outnumbering their competitors.

EV registrations during the period accounted for 7.4 per cent of the total market, up from 5.2 per cent during the same nine-month period in 2022.

The news was first reported by Automotive News.

Tesla had a commanding lead by brand, with 489,454 EVs registered in the US during the period, representing a 41 per cent increase year over year.

Following Tesla were Chevrolet (50,160) and Ford (46,547) in second and third place, respectively, with total EV registrations totalling 852,904, up 61 per cent (year on year), the report showed.

Tesla registrations were dominated by the Model Y (293,398) and Model 3 (165,543), with the Model X ranking eighth. The Model S did not make the top ten list.

The report also suggested that, if current trends continue, 2023 could be the first year in which EV sales in the US exceed one million.

Meanwhile, Tesla might start rolling out on Indian roads soon as the Centre is ramping up the process to provide all the necessary approvals from the concerned departments by January 2024 for its entry into the country.

According to the reports, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) held a meeting with top officials recently to review the upcoming phase of EV manufacturing in the country, including Tesla's investment proposal.

This move is aimed at attracting companies like Tesla Inc. to not only sell but also manufacture their electric cars within the country. According to a Bloomberg reports, as part of an emerging electric vehicle policy, the government is actively considering provisions that would enable global car manufacturers to import EVs at concessional duty rates. However, this benefit would be contingent on their commitment to eventually establish manufacturing facilities in India. Individuals familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the discussions on the policy's specifics are ongoing, and a final decision is yet to be reached.

In 2021, the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer based in Austin sought reductions in import duties for electric vehicles. Specifically, Tesla aimed to lower the rates from the existing 70 percent -100 percent range to 40 percent, contingent on the import value of its vehicles.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is reportedly expected to meet with Trade Minister Piyush Goyal later this week to discuss the company's intentions to establish a factory in India. Minister Goyal is currently in San Francisco for ministerial engagements related to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.

Tesla's interest in the Indian market is driven by the growing demand for electric vehicles within the country's expanding middle class. Should Tesla proceed with its investment, it would contribute to the Indian government's objectives of boosting manufacturing in the nation's GDP and generating employment opportunities.

As of now, India's electric car market is in its early stages, constituting a mere 1.3 percent of total passenger vehicle sales last year, as reported by BloombergNEF. The growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the country has been impeded by factors such as the high cost of cars, limited options, and a scarcity of charging infrastructure.

An overview of Tesla Inc. stock (TSLA)

Tesla is one of the most recognizable brand names in the world. After an initial investment of $6.5 million made entrepreneur Elon Musk the largest shareholder, he became CEO in 2008. He has remained high-profile, and Tesla has become a leader in electric vehicles and clean energy technology.

In 2010, Tesla went public, and its stock has since become one of the most widely traded on the market. Today, Tesla is worth around $600 billion, making it the most valuable automaker in the world.

What Tesla's latest financial reports disclose

Tesla's most recent earnings for fourth-quarter 2022 showed record revenue of $24.32 billion and earnings per share of $1.19. Automotive revenue accounted for over $21.3 billion in the final three months of 2022, with gross margins at 25.9%. The $21.3 billion figure represents 33% year-over-year growth.

The company acknowledged a downward trend in auto sales among electric vehicles and stressed the need for affordability in an increasingly competitive market. Regardless, Tesla stock value experienced volatility not seen since the most recent Tesla stock split.

Tesla's stock split

In August 2020, the electric car manufacturer announced a five-for-one split, followed by a three-for-one in August 2022. In both instances, Tesla's stock split allowed investors to buy multiple shares of Tesla stocks for the price of one before the split.

Both moves aimed to make the stock price more accessible to individual investors and attractive to institutional shareholders. Existing shareholders, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and managed mutual funds, saw a multiplication of their stock dividend payments.

Tesla's current competition

Tesla faces competition from other electric vehicle companies such as Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen and Chinese car makers BYD and SGMW. Other staple automakers like Honda and Toyota want to compete with Tesla in the electric vehicle market and are expected to provide significant competition for Tesla in the future.

This is of particular concern to Tesla in the international market. In 2022 alone, Chinese manufacturer BYD more than tripled the previous year's sales by selling over 1.85 million plug-in electric cars. SGMW also saw sales above 1.6 million units in 2022. Analyst conjecture places either or both companies on the board as stiff competition for Tesla in developing markets.

How to buy Tesla stock

If you're looking to invest in Tesla — or want to know how to buy stocks in general — you can do it in multiple ways. You can choose from individual stocks, mutual funds and more. If it's your first time buying stock, you may need to set up a brokerage account. Here's a step-by-step guide to buying Tesla stock, including the options you have.

Choose an investment method

Before becoming a player in the Tesla stock market, you'll need to choose a way to invest. Purchasing individual company stocks is today's most common method of investing in Tesla stock. However, there are several different options for investing, including diversified ETFs, mutual funds and index funds.

Individual company stocks

When you buy individual stocks of Tesla, you're purchasing a share of the company and becoming a partial owner. Individual stocks bought through a broker are the most straightforward method and can provide the highest potential return on investment. A downside is that it may be riskier than other options like mutual funds or ETFs, especially for beginner investors.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

ETFs are traded on stock exchanges that track a basket of securities across several market segments or industry sectors, such as stocks or bonds. ETFs are typically more protected from risk than individual stocks because they are diversified. The price depends on the market and they can be bought or sold throughout the day when the market is open.

An ETF keyed to the performance of Tesla stock could theoretically provide investors with returns similar to a Tesla stock forecast but could help investors manage stock market volatility.

Mutual funds

Like ETFs, mutual funds offer an alternative that can shield investors from risk. Mutual funds are professionally managed portfolios representing many investors' interests in a diversified securities portfolio. Tesla stock would just be one of many that you would purchase in a mutual fund share.

Mutual funds often have higher fees than ETFs. Additionally, they're only bought and sold once daily at the end of the day, so everyone pays the same price. But, you may be required to make a minimum investment amount.

Index funds

Index funds invest in a basket of stocks meant to track a stock market index, such as the S&P 500. Index funds are generally less risky than individual stocks but also provide less growth potential. Several significant index funds invest in Tesla, including the S&P 500.

Open a brokerage account

Once you've chosen an investment method, you may need to open a brokerage account if you don't have one yet. A brokerage account allows you to buy and sell stocks and other investments. To open one, first research different brokerages and choose one that best meets your needs.

You'll need to fill out an application and supply personal information, such as your name, address and Social Security number. You'll also need to provide financial information, such as your income and net worth. Once approved, you'll be able to begin investing.

Decide how much you want to invest

Once you've opened a brokerage account, you must decide how much you want to invest. Your budget and Tesla stock prices factor into this decision. However, figuring out how much to invest is also a personal decision based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, among other things.

Consider your age, income, current financial situation and any existing investments you own. Another important consideration when creating a budget is leaving enough funding for your other financial goals while still being able to invest comfortably.

In addition, assess your risk tolerance and determine the type of investments suitable for your financial goals. Whether you invest in stocks, mutual funds, bonds or other opportunities, you can consult a financial professional for a tailored investment strategy that meets your needs.

You can invest as little or as much as you want, but it's essential to understand that investing in stocks comes with risk. Only invest money that you can afford to lose.

Purchase your Tesla stocks

Once you have decided how much you want to invest, divide your total potential investment by the current share price of Tesla. Place an order with your brokerage for that number of shares.

Monitor your investment

One of the most common mistakes investors make is to buy a stock and then fail to keep tabs on it. Even if you plan to hold a long position, monitoring your investment is vital. Pay attention to Tesla stock forecast figures and how the stock performs over time. At the very least, aim for a mid-year investment portfolio checkup with a financial advisor.

Best practices for buying shares in Tesla stock

There are several best practices you should follow when buying shares in Tesla stock. Take the time to research the Tesla stock chart before investing. Look into the company's financials, the competition and the industry trends.

You can examine Tesla's stock price history over the most recent few months and identify a target price that will let you buy when the market is low. Above all, understand the risk involved. Tesla's stock news isn't always positive, so it's essential to understand the potential for losses.

Understand analyst stock ratings

Before buying shares in Tesla, it's helpful to understand Tesla stock predictions and how analysts arrive at their stock ratings. Analysts rate stocks according to their potential growth rate, risk level, industry and competitive position. Understanding analyst ratings can help you decide when to buy or sell Tesla stock.

Brush up on common stock market terms

Knowing common stock market terms before buying Tesla stock is important. Understanding terms such as dividend, P/E ratio and market capitalization can help you make informed investment decisions. Knowing the terminology and understanding how the stock market works can help you make wiser choices and maximize your potential for success.

How has inflation affected Tesla's stocks?

High inflation has impacted Tesla's stock price in the past and continues to pose some challenges for the automotive industry and the electric vehicle segment as a whole. In general, as inflation drives up the cost and interest rates rise, demand could slow down and the stocks could take a hit. However, Tesla dropped the price of some of its cars in an effort to make them more affordable. Still, inflation is something to be aware of when investing in any company.

Are Tesla stocks a good investment?

Tesla is one of the most talked about stocks on the market. It has become a household name with its innovative products and services, and many investors have been looking to buy stocks in this company. However, it's essential to remember that investing in any stock comes with risk, and Tesla is no exception.

Despite technological advances in energy generation and storage systems, Tesla stock fell 65% in 2022. However, it has seen some recovery in early 2023. Still, the company saw substantial growth rates in vehicle deliveries, earnings and revenue in 2022.

If demand stays at current levels, Tesla may be able to produce fewer cars than it could sell this year. However, competition in the electric vehicles industry is increasing. Additionally, if supply chain issues worsen or other components come into play, Tesla stock could suffer. The effect of Federal Reserve rate hikes on automotive sales could also affect it. Lastly, it's worth noting that Tesla stock is known for its volatility, partly due to its CEO — for example, the value fell when he purchased Twitter.

If you're deciding if you should invest in Tesla, keep all of these factors in mind before making a decision. Tesla has traditionally been a growth stock and, therefore, riskier than some other more established market segments. If you want to add Tesla to your investment portfolio, consider consulting with a financial advisor to see how it fits.",,2295,news,US,en,Kristopher Kane,https://charlotteobserver.wp.moneyresearchcollective.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/media-temp-15520220804-9360-18qpazd.jpg,False,,9.836212,bc2f5f7990578e1c43622d5ee0770674

Unveiled at the Guangzhou Auto Show, the fully electric SUV is part of BYD's new premium Sea Lion brand and is strategically positioned to compete directly with Tesla's Shanghai-made Model Y.



Priced between 200,000 yuan (USD27,879) and 260,000 yuan (USD36,270), the Sea Lion 07 features BYD's in-house-developed DiSus body control system, designed to minimize the risk of vehicle rollover during high-speed cornering. Analysts anticipate increased competition between BYD and Tesla as the Chinese automaker aims to challenge Tesla's established models.



Chen Jinzhu, CEO of the consultancy Shanghai Mingliang Auto Service, emphasized that BYD's move to produce vehicles comparable to Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y signifies a potential tit-for-tat race. Notably, BYD enjoys a cost advantage over its United States rival, presenting a stern challenge for Tesla in the competitive Chinese market.



BYD, backed by Berkshire Hathaway, emerged as the world's largest EV maker last year, dethroning Tesla. However, its primary focus has been on producing pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars targeting low- and middle-income wage earners in mainland China. In contrast, Tesla's Model Y, assembled at its Gigafactory in Shanghai, starts at a higher price point, commencing at 266,400 yuan (USD37,160).



The unveiling of the Sea Lion 07 marks BYD's strategic expansion into the premium EV market, where Tesla has maintained a dominant position. As the competition intensifies, industry experts will be closely watching the dynamics between BYD and Tesla in this evolving landscape of China's rapidly growing electric vehicle sector.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_Politics_1020.jpg,False,@menafn,8.463494,d1f852a423a53e340f5b42736decd1ef

It will also pave the way for a local factory in the next two years and an

official announcement is anticipated at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit scheduled for January.

States of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu being under consideration due to their well-established ecosystems for electric vehicles and exports, the report added.

As part of the potential agreement, Tesla is expected to commit an initial minimum investment of approximately USD 2 billion for the plant, with plans to escalate purchases of auto parts from India to as much as USD 15 billion.

Additionally, the Elon Musk led-company aims to manufacture some batteries within India to reduce costs, Bloomberg sources disclosed.

While no final decision has been reached, these plans are subject to change, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk had previously stated in June that the company intends to make a'significant investment' in India, with plans for a visit in 2024.

Tesla Inc. is on the brink of making substantial inroads into India, a country experiencing a surge in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

The Information reports that worker injuries and safety lapses are common at Tesla's giant Texas factory, where the Cybertruck is being built.

One out of every 21 workers were reportedly hurt in 2022. The data is derived from the required injury reports Tesla submits to OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) in the US.

""An explosion in the castings department. A worker pinned by a robot. Elon Musk's gargantuan car factory in Austin is critical to Tesla's plans to sell 20 million vehicles a year. But there's a pattern of risky incidents at the plant, current and former workers say,"" the report alleged.

In 2021, an engineer was programming the software that controls manufacturing robots at Tesla's Texas factory when something went wrong. One of the robots'pinned the engineer against a surface, pushing its claws into his body and drawing blood from his back and his arm,' the report claimed, citing people who saw it happened.

""After another worker hit an emergency stop button, the engineer maneuvered his way out of the robot's grasp, falling a couple of feet down a chute designed to collect scrap aluminum and leaving a trail of blood behind him, one of the witnesses said,"" the report noted.

An injury report submitted to Travis County, Texas, by Tesla reportedly has a robot-related incident but does not clearly match the one from witness accounts.

In August 2022, a worker's ankle got caught under a cart, which put them out of work for 127 days. Days later, another worker suffered a head injury which put them out for 85 days, the report alleged.

Around New Year 2023, at least one worker was concussed after getting launched back from an explosion in the metal casting area. The blast was allegedly caused by water inadvertently mixing into the molten aluminum press machine.

Tesla's Fremont factory in California also has a similar history with worker injuries. The Cybertruck, which was first announced in 2019, is Tesla's first new product in years.

Tesla initially stated that the truck would start at $39,900, but it is expected to be much more expensive due to expensive building materials. The Cybertruck is set to hit the market at the end of the month.

The Florida lawsuit was filed after a 2019 crash in Miami when Stephen Banner's Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler truck that had turned onto the road, cutting off the Tesla's roof and killing Banner.

Judge Scott's finding that Tesla's top management knew of the defects could also mean Musk would have to testify, reports TechCrunch.

Tesla marketed the products as autonomous and Musk's public statements about Autopilot'had a significant effect on the belief about the capabilities of the products,' according to the ruling.

The ruling means the family of a man who died in a collision while his Tesla's Autopilot was engaged'can go to trial and seek punitive damages from Tesla for intentional misconduct and gross negligence'.

In August, a grieving widow sued Tesla in the US after her husband died in a 2020 crash involving a Model 3 vehicle.

Jyung Woo Hahn, 46, died on March 12, 2022, when his Tesla malfunctioned and collided with a tree and burst into flames in New York.

He allegedly survived the initial crash but was trapped in the burning vehicle.

The plaintiff Jiyoung Yoon sued Tesla in the US District Court, Southern District of New York, for its role in designing, manufacturing, distributing, and selling the vehicle'in its defective and unreasonably dangerous condition and for causing Hahn's horrific injuries, suffering, and death'.

Last month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) probed Musk-run Tesla for the advertised range of its TVs and personal decisions.

The electric car-maker disclosed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that the Justice department issued subpoenas related to perks, vehicle range and personal decisions.

Tesla has also been pulled up by the US road safety regulators to provide extensive data about its driver assistance and driver monitoring systems, known as 'Elon mode'.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk informed his followers that'Tesla Roadster is now fully open sourced.

'All design and engineering of the original @Tesla Roadster is now fully open source,' the tech billionaire said.

'Whatever we have, you now have,' Musk added about the 15-year-old Roadster.

Musk replied:'Some assembly required'.

The Roadster page includes service, parts, and owners manuals, wiring schematics, and R&D documents on the car's battery monitor board, vehicle display system, and HVAC controller.

Tesla open-sourced all its patents back in 2015. The original Tesla Roadster hasn't been in production for more than a decade now

Tesla produced just over 2,000 units of Roadster, and many of them were lost to accidents and some very unfortunate fires at a garage in Arizona, reports Electrek.

'The information provided is as a courtesy to Roadster enthusiasts and was created during the design phase of the Roadster for research and development.

Tesla's ‘Make-in-India' plan 
Tesla Inc. is on the brink of making substantial inroads into India, a country experiencing a surge in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).
Currently operating factories in the US, China, and Germany, Tesla's potential venture in India follows the Indian government's active push, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for increased domestic manufacturing of EVs to expedite the shift towards cleaner transportation.
Despite the government's efforts, India's EV market has encountered limited growth, constituting merely 1.3 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales last year, according to BloombergNEF.
Challenges such as the high upfront cost of electric cars and an insufficient charging infrastructure have contributed to this restrained growth.

Elon Musk said that Tesla 'left a few things on the table' when it released the 2017 Model 3 Performance trim, so the 2024 Model 3 Highland facelift's Performance version will apparently be 'pretty special.' The current Model 3 Performance package can launch it from 0-60 in a bit over 3 seconds. 
E-Mobility






A Tesla Australia employee has shared the good news about the launch of a maximized Tesla Model 3 Performance trim before the second quarter of next year had passed. A covered Tesla was recently caught 
testing
 with what looked the Sport Wheel and Winter Tire Package for the Model 3, complete with sporty red calipers and all, just without the black hubcaps with the Tesla logo. 


At the time, it was thought that this might be the top-shelf Model 3 version as the 
Highland
 wasn't even released yet, and there is now a tangential confirmation about the existence of said trim. A ""
pretty special
"" Model 3 Performance is apparently prepped for release in the first half of 2024, which will allow Tesla to add the ""
few things we left on the table
"" when developing the 2017 Model 3 Performance. 


At the time, Elon Musk was going through ""production hell"" trying to ramp up manufacturing of Tesla's first midrange electric car, and the Performance version was somewhat of an afterthought. 


Insanely quick afterthought, though, and if a ""special"" 2024 Model 3 Performance materializes indeed, it may have a 0-60 mph acceleration in less than 3 seconds this time. Upgraded brakes and special tires might be a go, too, as well as a much higher price than the base Model 3 Highland trim that will cost about US$40,600 when it is released for purchase in Australia this coming January. 


Coincidentally, that is when the 
Model 3 Highland release in the US
 may happen as well, but it is unclear if Tesla fans in America will also be getting a Performance version in the same January-June timeframe, too. Tesla reportedly thought about calling the ""special"" 2024 Model 3 things like Plaid or Ludicrous, but the beaten Performance naming path won out in the end.

Scheduled for a Thursday unveiling, the American electric car manufacturer has maintained a veil of secrecy around the truck's crucial information.



The Cybertruck made its debut as a test model in November 2019, with experimental production kicking off in July of the following year. Initial plans announced by Tesla in April aimed at commencing deliveries to buyers by September. The truck is expected to be available in two range categories, with estimates from the US Environmental Protection Administration suggesting a 400 km and an 800 km option.



This launch marks Tesla's first foray into introducing a new passenger car since the Model Y in early 2020. Back then, Tesla had initially stated a starting price of $39,000 for the truck. However, Elon Musk, Tesla's founder and president, expressed his desire for the base price to be under $50,000.



Despite the looming launch date, Tesla has chosen to keep crucial details under wraps, leaving enthusiasts and potential buyers eagerly awaiting information on the Cybertruck's pricing and specifications. Musk, in prior statements, hinted that the actual prices might surpass the initial estimates significantly.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_Aviationtransport_165.jpg,False,@menafn,9.776026,0db729f9a2cbdca24ca65b4a71c2419d

Deliveries of 367","(MENAFN- Asia Times) In 2019, Tesla was in the happy position of being a high-volume, premium-priced leader in the global electric vehicle (EV) market. Deliveries of 367,500 cars represented 50% growth over 2018.

That included 92,550 of the mid-sized Model 3 cars and 19,450 of the larger Model S and X vehicles during the fourth quarter, implying strong future growth and producing annual revenue of US$$24.5 billion .

The same year, Tesla announced the Cybertruck. This new futuristic-looking vehicle represented the company's first move into light/pickup trucks . Deliveries were initially planned for 2021.

Yet the Cybertruck has been beset with delays over things like the weight, making it difficult to achieve an adequate battery range, and the surging cost of bulletproof glass – it will now only be available as an add-on. Deliveries finally begin on November 30, meaning 2024 will be the first full production year.

Tesla has simultaneously been managing a difficult transition. Formerly a disruptive entrant rewriting the rules, it is now an incumbent trying to protect sales volumes and profit margins. A hectic growth strategy has seen a new gigafactory in Shanghai that started output in early 2020, plus two others near Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, which both opened in 2022.

In 2023, Tesla expects to sell 1.8 million vehicles overall, roughly double 2021 sales. But things can change very quickly in this industry, and Tesla faces different challenges in its three main markets of China, Europe and the US. The big question is whether the Cybertruck can resolve them.

684,Tesla delivers first Cybertrucks to customers,Published Pm Ct Nov.,2023-11-30 00:00:00,date,https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/transportation/2023/11/30/tesla-announces-pricing--specs-for-new-cybertruck,spectrumlocalnews.com,The first Cybertrucks were delivered Thursday.,"Driving the highly anticipated Tesla Cybertruck onto a stage in Austin, Texas, on Thursday, before handing over the steering wheel to a handful of new owners, Elon Musk revealed the performance figures for the futuristic all-electric pickup that has racked up 2 million preorders in the past four years.
 
'Finally, the future will look like the future,' Musk said to a small but enthusiastic crowd, as he spoke from the bed of the new truck. 'What we have here is something that's a better truck for a truck while also being a better sports car than a sports car in the same package.'


During a livestreamed event over his social media platform, X, that was watched by more than 110,000 people, Musk screened videos that showed the Cybertruck drag racing a Porsche 911 and winning, before revealing the Cybertruck was also hauling a Porsche 911 when it did so.


He also showed a video of the Cybertruck being fired at with a tommy gun. The stainless steel super alloy siding was dented but was not penetrated.


'If Al Capone showed up with a tommy gun and emptied the entire magazine into the car door, you'd still be alive,' he said. 'Why make it bulletproof? Why not?'


In addition to being bulletproof, the Cybertruck's stainless steel exoskeleton cannot corrode and does not need paint.


To show off the shatterproof glass that famously failed during the Cybertruck's introduction in November 2019, Musk had Cybertruck designer Franz von Holzhausen repeating the stunt with a baseball that bounced of the passenger glass window.


Videos also showed the Cybertruck hauling a Space X rocket to demonstrate it can haul 11,000 pounds and has a payload of 2,500 pounds. The truck's bed is six feet long, four feet wide and capable of carrying 4-foot-by-8-foot pieces of plywood with the back down, Musk said.


Showing a rollover test, Musk said the center of gravity was so low, rollovers were not possible. At the same time, he highlighted the Cybertruck's adaptive air suspension, which can provide 17' of ground clearance if it's driven off road.


Saying the ride quality was quiet and 'smooth as sillk,' Musk highlighted a new steer-by-wire system more commonly used on jets. Turning the steering wheel a small amount in a parking lot will cause the wheels to turn a lot while turning the steering wheel a small amount on a highway will only turn them slightly. He added that the Cybertruck's turning radius is smaller than the Tesla Model S flagship full-size sedan.


'This is really going to change the look of the roads,' he said, as he greeted each of the new Cybertruck owners who received their cars at the event.


The company announced pricing and specs for the long-awaited vehicles:




Rear-wheel drive: $60,990 (250 mile range)


All-wheel drive: $79,990 (340 mile range)


""Cyberbeast"": $99,990 (320 mile range)




The Cybertruck is Tesla's sixth passenger vehicle. The company first introduced its roadster sports car in 2008. That was followed by the Model S in 2012, the Model X in 2015, the Model 3 in 2017 and the Model Y in 2020.

Four years after startling the car world with designs for the Cybertruck, Elon Musk is set Thursday to mark the arrival of Tesla's iconoclastic take on the American pickup.

Musk has scheduled an event at Tesla's Austin headquarters to mark the first deliveries to customers of the Cybertruck, whose design to some has evoked a futuristic, sometimes dystopian future akin to ""Blade Runner"" or ""Mad Max.""

The belated debut comes as other automakers have delayed capital investments due to sluggish demand for electric vehicles. Tesla itself has undertaken numerous price cuts, even as its share price has stayed lofty.

""This is an important launch for Musk and the Tesla brand,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives in an email to AFP.

The omnipresent Musk has faced even more scrutiny than usual following criticism that the billionaire entrepreneur and his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, have promoted a growing wave of anti-Semitism.

""We do not believe the Tesla brand has been negatively impacted, but it's a careful balance for Elon he is trying to tightrope,"" said Ives, who praised Musk's recent trip to Israel after the latest X controversy.

- Challenging design -

Musk caused a stir in November 2019 when the prototype of the angular, uniformly gray Cybertruck generated much curiosity and buzz even if it wasn't universally loved.

""It doesn't look like anything else,"" said Musk.

The launch event included a demo conducted by a vehicle designer intended to highlight the truck's toughness. Its body emerged unscathed from an encounter with a sledgehammer but the window cracked when struck with a metal ball.

But the vehicle's unusual styling, which employs large flat plates of unbent stainless steel, poses challenges in manufacturing, said Art Wheaton, an expert on transportation industries at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

""It may look cool, but it's extremely difficult to manufacture successfully,"" Wheaton said.

The vehicle was originally billed with a starting price of $39,900 and first production to come in 2021.

Musk has stayed effusive on the design but has sought to limit expectations as to the vehicle's commercial potential, saying, ""we dug our own grave with Cybertruck"" last month.

""Cybertruck is one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while,"" he said. ""And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous.""

With more than one million Cybertruck orders, demand is not an issue, Musk said. But making it affordable will be ""insanely difficult,"" said Musk, who expects to reach an output of 250,000 probably some time in 2025.

- 'Attention-grabber' -

Though less prominent in several areas outside the United States, pickup trucks occupy a distinct and dominant place on American roads, generating huge sales volumes from consumers who appreciate their image of rugged self-sufficiency.

Once again last year, the three top-selling models in the US were pickups, led by Ford's F series with more than 650,000 trucks sold, followed by General Motors and Ram (Stellantis) models, according to Car & Driver.

The biggest question surrounding Thursday's event will be updated retail pricing of the vehicle, said CFRA equity analyst Garrett Nelson, who expects the price to have risen to about $50,000 given supply chain pressures and higher material costs.

Nelson called the Cybertruck a ""much higher-risk"" product compared with Tesla's current fleet of autos, but noted that Musk ""has done a good job of lowering expectations.""

Wheaton, the expert at Cornell, is skeptical the Cybertruck will be a big seller in part because of the ""polarizing"" design.

But Cybertruck could still succeed for Musk even if it turns out to be a niche product if it lures customers to the brand. Wheaton likened the effect to the Chevrolet Corvette, which does not account for huge sales but draws in buyers to other GM vehicles.

""I don't think it's going to be a massive success in terms of selling big numbers,"" Wheaton predicted. ""It works as a kind of attention-grabber.""",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/29/AFP_9c8e5image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.465314,de46290fdb33e481b25d6805c3175cfe

Let's get into the issues and questions raised by production trucks just delivered.","The 
 Cybertruck
 is finally here, or at least a few of them are. 
Check out our rundown
 of the livestreamed debut and summary of prices, specs and features, if you haven't already, and my colleague 
James Riswick has already weighed in
 with some thoughts.
 
But yes, the 
truck
 is late. Yes, it's more expensive than expected. No, it doesn't go as far on a charge, nor hold as much payload, nor tow as much weight as promised. Whatever. That's  and that's the new normal, especially when it comes to EVs. (Autonomous cars, anyone? Quad-motor 
Rivian R1T
 with the Max Pack, anyone? $40,000 
Chevrolet
 Silverado EV Work Truck, anyone?) We're all just going to have to get over it.
 
And why wouldn't we get over it with this outer space beast to finally enjoy? Look, as you'll discover if you continue reading, or if you read 
my pieces on the  Semi
, I am no  fanboy. I have zero interest in owning a Cybertruck. I am still thrilled every time I get in my 
1999 Ford F-250
 Super Duty with the 7.3. But I respect the game.  CEO Musk wanted the ""
Blade Runner""
 of pickups, in my opinion, his team delivered. The Cybertruck, as a project and as a vehicle to see on streets, looks cool as sh**. How will it be to live with, or charge, or get repaired, or drive off-road? Owners will know, I don't. But I know that enthusiasts have spent nearly two decades decrying how all cars look the same. Here's one that doesn't. 
I'm with Giorgetto Giugiaro on this one
. I applaud it.
 
Having said that, let's get into a few issues, questions, and new info about The United Federation of Planets' official pickup:
 
 
The size
 
The production truck is different dimensionally than the concept. 
A slide with the dimensions
 shown during 
the 2019 reveal
 claimed these numbers: 231.7 inches long, 79.8 inches wide, 75 inches high, with a 6.5-foot bed, 100 cubic feet of exterior storage. Its bed was also said to be 57 inches across, just short of five feet. According to the Cybertruck page at 's site, the production truck in Cyberbeast and AWD trims is 223.7 inches long, 86.6 inches wide with the mirrors folded, 95 inches wide with mirrors out — we'll come back to this point in a second — 70 inches high, with a 6-foot-long bed that's 4 feet across, and 67 cubic feet of lockable storage. 
 
Maximum ride height at the reveal was a claimed 16 inches. We're not sure what the maximum height of the production truck is while moving, but on its tippy toes, the production truck is claimed to get up to 17.4 inches high in Extract Mode, which sounds like it's only for getting out of jams, not normal motoring.
 
 
Where are the markers?
 
The book of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards demands that vehicles wider than 80 inches feature marker lamps — the three amber lights at the front of a vehicle that let other drivers know there's a wide load ahead. The 2024 
Ford Raptor
 R, an exact match for the Cybertruck at 86.6 inches wide without mirrors, wears three amber lights at the leading edge of its hood, atop the grille. The 86.7-inch 2024 GMC 
Hummer
 EV shows off three amber lights at the top edge of windshield. The 88-inch-wide 2023 
Ram 1500
 TRX tucks its marker lights in its hood scoop. Has anyone seen marker lights on the production version of the Cybertruck? We haven't. The 
concept appeared to mount them
 at the top of the windshield, however, that's where the optional light bar goes now.
 
We don't see the lights in twilight photos where the Cybertruck has its headlight and taillight on, nor do we see them in 
Jason Camissa's video review of the Cybertruck
. Maybe the lights will appear at the top of the windshield at some point, but they shouldn't be this difficult to see right now. We'd like to know how the 10 units delivered Thursday night are going to stay on the road legally if the markers aren't on the truck. Then again, the mirror mounts seem kind of recessed, so maybe the body itself squeezes just under the 80-inch mark. It's just a strange mixup to have a concept with markers but under 80 inches wide, and have a production version listed at 86.6 inches wide with no markers.
 
It's not a  event without a few statements that can only be answered with a sideways glance. Musk said the Cybertruck is ""a better truck than a truck, and a better sports car than a sports car in the same package.""
 
The Cybertruck can and should be celebrated for quite a few things, but this is two lies in one sentence. The Cybertruck isn't for men and women who spend their days doing Real Truck Stuff all day every day, like hauling heavy things, towing heavy things, or even reaching repeatedly over a bedside to grab things. The Cybertruck isn't for the men and women who spend their Sunday mornings hooning sports cars up and down (paved) canyon roads. The Cyberbeast beating a 
Porsche 911
 in a quarter-mile while pulling a 911? Marketing laffy-taffy. A base 
Corvette
 Z06 will match the Cyberbeast to 60 if you get the perfect start ('s time doesn't count the rollout), will beat the Cyber in the quarter-mile, and will do so more times on a tank of gas than the Cybertruck will on a charge.
 
The Cybertruck, like the  Semi, doesn't need this kind of fluff. Just look at it! 
 
 
The range extender
 
Drew Baglino, 's SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering, said on X (ex-Twitter) that the range extender is a ""toolbox-sized battery"" sitting in the bed. By ""toolbox,"" he had to be referring to the lockable toolbox some pickups fit across their beds behind the cab, because the extender is two feet long, four feet wide, and of an unknown height. A bed toolbox filled with tools isn't a portable item. A lithium-ion battery that size? Come on. Further proof, the Cybertruck page contains this sentence about the energy cell: ""Go even further with a range extender installed into the Cybertruck's bed. Offering up to 470 miles of total range. Installed separately.""
 
The battery is claimed to add 130 miles of range to the mid-level AWD trim, delivering that estimated 470-mile range. On the top Cyberbeast trim, the range extender adds 120 miles, for a total of 
440
 miles of range. The 
2024 Fiat 500e
 and its 42-kWh battery will probably post an EPA-rated range of not much more than 130 miles when it gets here next year. The 
Fiat 500e
 is a lot lighter than a Cybertruck, with a lot less frontal area. There's no way the Cybertruck range extender is portable, hence the word 'Installed' in the description. This is going to live in the bed. 
An X user who dug through
  website's HTML found source data suggesting the range extender will cost $16,000, which is roughly the cost of replacing the entire 82-kWh battery in the 
Model 3
.
 
We don't know what this accessory will run, but it won't be cheap and it won't be light, so prepare to give up a chunk of that 2,500-pound max payload capacity.
 
 
The spare
 
The 
Cybertruck has an accessories page
 full of kit, including a cargo rack, cleats, a sunshade, and a 20-inch spare wheel and Goodyear tire. The spare is going to be a necessity for anyone who plans to go deep off-road. 
The wheel and tire cost $1,250
 and come with the tools to change a wheel, like a jack and a telescoping lug nut wrench. The 
Goodyear site comes up with one option
 for a 285/65 20-inch tire, the 
Wrangler
 Duratrec RT-LT for $467 retail. 
 
Bundling the tools with the spare makes us wonder if a jack and lug wrench 
don't
 come standard with the Cybertruck. Also, it's a bottle jack, which brings up more questions. The Cybertruck stands so tall and has 12 inches of suspension travel, we can't see a bottle jack getting a tire off the ground if the jack's placed anywhere under the body. On a truck like this, the easiest way to get a tire off the ground with a traditional jack is to put the jack under the differential, or use a Hi-Lift jack to raise the wheel itself, then put a jack stand under an axle. Considering the size shape of a traditional differential housing, the tiny contact circle at the top of a bottle jack is not what you want for the job. Did  make a special place for it?
 
Anyway, the image used for the spare has the spare mounted flat, strapped down at the head of the bed in the same place the range extender battery would go. A wheel and tire combo this size is 34.6 inches tall, meaning the spare placed like that would eat up nearly half the length of the bed, taking up even more space than the range extender battery. Standing the spare up in the bed against the bulkhead would be ideal, but you might not be able to close the tonneau. Carrying the range extender and a spare, which is exactly what you'd want if you planned to go deep off-road in your Cybertruck, looks like it will entail serious compromises. 
 
We want more information on mounting options, though. The 
aftermarket
 needs to come through with a spare carrier. Until then, the 
$550 air compressor
 and tire repair kit would make a lot of sense.
 
Oh yeah, if you want Cybertruck wheel covers — the ones the truck is always wearing except when prepped for sale — they're also 
on the accessories page at $75 a pop
. And only  owners can buy them.
 
The empty boasts
 
The 'shatter-resistant glass' that's 'basically rock-proof,' good up to ""Class 4,"" and keeps the cabin ""as quiet as outer space"" ...
 
All automotive glass is shatter-resistant, windshields especially so. ""Basically"" stopping rocks means, as 's website says, the glass ""can resist the impact of a baseball at 70 mph."" A baseball-sized rock at 70 mph is going to be a different story. The statement about 'Class 4' hail resistance was Musk 
using a term developed for the hail-resistance of roofing materials
, Class 4 being the strongest. And this one might be pedantic, but … you wouldn't want a cabin as quiet as outer space even if it were possible. Space is a 
vacuum
. There's no sound in a vacuum. It's already disconcerting enough being in a Rolls-Royce. And ask firefighters and EMTs if they want everyone in their personal Major Tom space bubbles.
 
On a more lighthearted note, the accessories store offers a broken window decal that makes the left rear window look like the window that shattered at the Cybertruck reveal. Called the '
Cybertruck OMFG Decal
,' it goes over the production truck's rear window and costs $55 — in case you missed out on getting 
one of the $35 T-shirts
 that cashed in on the faux pas.
 
The Cybertruck is bullet-resistant.
 
This is a comedown from earlier claims of being bulletproof, but it still doesn't make sense to heed this boast. Armor resistance is rated in levels so that everyone understands 
what kind of bullets
 a ""bulletproof"" object can stop. When we write about an Inkas truck, 
like its J76 Toyota Land Cruiser
, we say, for example, ""The armor bits start with 
BR6-level plating
 that surrounds the entire passenger cell with ballistic steel at a minimum thickness of 0.3 inches (41mm), plus armored skid plating that doubles as a blast shield."" (BR6 armor can stop rifle rounds in modern high-power calibers.) The Cybertruck's 301 stainless steel stainless steel isn't ballistic steel, but videos have shown the 3-mm-thick panels can stop off-the-shelf 9mm or .45-caliber. Great. But the windows can't. And there are other kinds of bullets. 
 
The Cybertruck has greater ""torsional stiffness than a McLaren P1.""
 
A useless measure. Any automaker can make a vehicle stiffer than a McLaren P1. Given enough time to order enough steel, you could make a structure stiffer than a McLaren P1, given enough time in your own garage to do so. Trophy Trucks aren't stiffer than a McLaren P1, but their suspensions are amazing. The 's test will be how well the adaptive suspension keeps occupants from realizing the Cybertruck is stiffer than a McLaren P1. We don't doubt  has done its homework in that regard.
 
The Cybertruck's low center of gravity makes it unlikely to roll over.
 
Name a battery-electric vehicle for which this isn't true when compared to traditional ICE vehicles in its class. Besides, a billion hours of dashcam videos on YouTube should prove to everyone that Sunday drivers and everyday physics can make the wildest things happen. Everything can roll over. Anywhere. But hey, the 
Model X was the first SUV
 to ace the 
NHTSA's
 crash test regime, partly thanks to its resistance to rolling over.
 
 
Final questions
 
 
The rear-view mirror is not only small, it won't provide a view if the tonneau is covered unless it's picking up a rear-view camera feed. We want to know what's going on there.
 
The triangular shape of the side mirrors means less view of what's behind. This could be exacerbated by the Cybertruck's also-compromised three-quarter view. Patience and paying excellent attention can get around this. However, know where these designer side mirrors are going to suck? Towing. Traditional truck mirrors are big for reasons, one of them being the need to get the biggest and best view of the upper rear corner of whatever you're pulling. Going to want a limber neck and shoulders to get the best view.
 
At the reveal, there was going to be a six-seater version or option that replaced the two front seats with a bench. What's up with that?
 
Will the locking front differential be automatically operated only, or driver-selectable? And what kind of brake-based torque vectoring programs will be available to the AWD and base trims, if any?
 
What's the rear headroom like?
 
The Cybertruck's charging port door is on the rear edge of the driver's side rear wheel arch. Two Cybertrucks pulling trailers drive into a Supercharger station. That's it. That's the whole joke. Now what? 
 
Vehicles over 6,000 pounds that are used mostly for business 
get an IRS tax benefit deduction
. The Cybertruck AWD weighs 6,603 pounds, the Cyberbeast weighs 6,843 pounds. Are we going to see a bunch of these in work fleets? Because we can definitely see realtors in certain areas of the country picking up a bunch of these (Looking at you, Scottsdale).

The company has already discounted new vehicle inventory by up to $3,000, and now offering free supercharging for new buyers.

The news was first reported by Electrek.

According to the company's website, consumers can now get six months of free supercharging if they buy and take delivery of a Model 3 or Model Y by December 31, 2023.

""Order a new Model 3 and take delivery by December 31, 2023, to be eligible for 6 months of free Supercharging,"" the offer reads.

However, this offer also comes with some conditions, with one mentioning that Tesla can remove your benefit ""in the event of excessive charging"".

""Tesla reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove the free Supercharging from your vehicle in the event of excessive charging"".

Meanwhile, a new report has shown Tesla vehicles have led US electric vehicle (EV) registrations by a significant margin during the first nine months of this year.

According to vehicle registration data from Experian, the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 were the two most registered EVs in the US between January and September, far outnumbering their competitors.

Tesla had a commanding lead by brand, with 489,454 EVs registered in the US during the period, representing a 41 per cent increase year over year.

Mazda's CEO has said that Tesla is the only company seeing real success in a fragile EV landscape, with other 
electric cars
 ""not taking off.""
 
Masahiro Moro 
told Fortune
 that consumers are still not sold on 
electric vehicles
, with EVs making up just a fraction of the U.S. market and cars 
piling up in dealerships
 as demand slows.
 
""EV is absolutely important technology, and we are developing it. But [in the U.S.] EVs last year [were] about 6% of the market. This year it is 8%. And out of that 8%, 57% was Tesla. Other EVs are not taking off, inventory is piling up,"" he said.
 
Tesla continues to dominate the U.S. EV market. While Elon Musk's company has 
cut prices multiple times in the past year
 in the face of competition from legacy automakers, it still commands over 
half the market
, with experts estimating that 
it will take a decade
 for rivals to catch up.
 
Unlike automakers like 
Ford
 and 
General Motors
, who have unveiled their own EV ranges in an attempt to challenge Tesla, Mazda has been more cautious.
 
The company has said that it wants at least 
25% of its cars to be electric by 2030
. It recently killed off its only EV sold in the U.S., the Mazda MX-30, after reportedly 
selling just 66 of them this year
. It continues to be sold abroad, however.
 
Moro's comments come at 
a moment of reckoning
 for the EV industry. Major auto companies have cut back on targets and spending amid slowing demand, with 
dealers
 having to turn away supplies and 
a lack of cheap EV options
 hurting adoption.
 
Ford has 
postponed a $12 billion investment
 in electric manufacturing, while General Motors has 
abandoned plans to build 500,000 EVs
 by the first half of 2024.
 
Despite this, sales are on the rise, with more than 1 million electric vehicles 
expected to be sold in the US
 this year for the first time, according to 
Atlas
 Public Policy.
 
Moro suggested that a lack of charging stations was one of the major reasons why companies are struggling to hit their target of producing only zero-emission vehicles.
 

 
Mazda did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI, made outside normal working hours.

In an event held at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas, Musk delivered the truck to about a dozen people and predicted that it would usher in a new, more exciting era, reports The Verge.

The company also revealed updated details about the pricing, range, and features of the truck at the event.

The rear-wheel drive version of the electric truck will cost $60,990, up from $39,900 in 2019. It will have a range of 250 miles on a single charge. However, the model will not be available until 2025.

The dual-motor and tri-motor ""Cyberbeast"" versions will be available sooner, i.e. 2024, according to Tesla's order page -- and will be more powerful.

The AWD Cybertruck will cost $79,990, have a range of 340 miles, hit 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds, and have a top speed of 112 mph. The tri-motor trim will cost $99,990, produce 845 horsepower, 10,296 lb-ft of torque, and have a range of around 320 miles, the report mentioned.

The prices stated at the event are significantly higher than the $50,000 price range the tech billionaire had long said the vehicle would retail for.

At the event, Musk invited Tesla's chief designer, Franz Von Holzhausen, to redo the infamous window strength demonstration from 2019, where he had previously attempted to smash the supposed armour-plated glass with a ball bearing but failed.

This time, Von Holzhausen threw a baseball, and the glass successfully withstood the projectile.

Tesla's Cybertruck
 is generating quite the buzz across the country ahead of its 
delivery event
 later this week.
 
Dozens of Tesla fans lined up outside some of the company's showrooms over the holiday weekend trying to catch a glimpse of the new Cybertruck. Users on X 
posted videos
 from multiple Tesla showrooms in the US that appeared to show lines of people wrapping around the buildings at locations where Tesla had chosen to display its electric-pickup 
truck
.
 
The company began putting Cybertrucks up for display at select locations last week, Electrek 
reported.
 
""My wife and I just got to the 
@Tesla 
Showroom in Tampa and there is a line wrapping around! No this isn't the Apple Store it's Tesla!"" @NickGibbsIAG posted on X Saturday.
 
Matthew Donegan-Ryan, who said he has filed multiple reservation orders for the Cybertruck, waited until Sunday to see the vehicle due to all the photos of the lines he'd seen posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
 
He told Business Insider over email he only had to wait about five minutes to see the vehicle.
 
""Pictures and video of the Cybertruck do not do it justice,"" Donegan-Ryan told BI over email. ""It looks so much better in person. It truly does appear to be computer generated and is instantly iconic."" 
 
Donegan-Ryan shared a series of videos from a showroom in Washington state on X.

Christian Artman, who said he reserved the vehicle over three years ago, 
told BI on X
 that there was a ""constant line"" and he waited about 15 minutes to see the EV when he went to see it at the Miami showroom on Friday.
 
""Tesla and Tesla engineering is amazing,"" Artman responded to BI on X.
 
""Everyone there is excited,"" Artman added regarding the crowd at the showroom.
 
X user Toby Li also shared a photo of a line that appeared to wrap around a showroom in Langley, British Columbia.
 
Tesla has scheduled a ""delivery event"" for November 30, but volume production of the vehicle appears to be far away. Tesla's global director of product design, Javier Verdura, said last week that the company plans to 
deliver only the first 10 Cybertrucks
 at the event. It's also not clear yet which customers will receive the vehicles first, and it may end up being Tesla employees — they were the first to receive the vehicle at a past Tesla delivery event for the 
Model 3
 in 2017.
 
The company has over 2 million preorders for the truck according to an online tally reported by 
Electrek
.
 
Elon Musk has warned
 that it will be difficult to scale production due to the vehicle's unusual design. The Tesla CEO said the company aims to produce about a quarter million Cybertrucks per year by 2025.
 
Even though the Cybertruck might not hit mass production anytime soon, at least one investor is hopeful the hype around the product might create help generate Tesla sales for other vehicles as well.

Deliveries of 367","Author: Peter Wells

(MENAFN- The Conversation) In 2019, Tesla was in the happy position of being a high-volume, premium-priced leader in the global electric vehicle (EV) market. Deliveries of 367,500 cars represented 50% growth over 2018.

That included 92,550 of the mid-sized Model 3 cars and 19,450 of the larger Model S and X vehicles during the fourth quarter, implying strong future growth and producing annual revenue of US$$24.5 billion (£19.4 billion).

The same year, Tesla announced the Cybertruck. This new futuristic-looking vehicle represented the company's first move into light/pickup trucks . Deliveries were initially planned for 2021.

Yet the Cybertruck has been beset with delays over things like the weight, making it difficult to achieve an adequate battery range, and the surging cost of bulletproof glass – it will now only be available as an add-on. Deliveries finally begin on November 30, meaning 2024 will be the first full production year.

Tesla has simultaneously been managing a difficult transition. Formerly a disruptive entrant rewriting the rules, it is now an incumbent trying to protect sales volumes and profit margins. A hectic growth strategy has seen a new gigafactory in Shanghai that started output in early 2020, plus two others near Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, which both opened in 2022.

In 2023, Tesla expects to sell 1.8 million vehicles overall, roughly double 2021 sales. But things can change very quickly in this industry, and Tesla faces different challenges in its three main markets of China, Europe and the US. The big question is whether the Cybertruck can resolve them.

Tesla unit sales 2016-23

Statista

The market breakdown

In China, Tesla faces multiple competitors, a looming overcapacity in battery production, and changing government rules on incentives and purchase taxes. It has consequently been engaging in'dynamic pricing', slashing the cost of Model 3s and Model Ys.

This has boosted unit sales, but Tesla is now distant second behind Shenzhen-based BYD, in terms of hybrids and full EVs combined. Its EV share dropped from 15% in 2020 to 10% in 2022, and is still declining .

Tesla revenues by region (2022)

In Europe, Tesla has also been cutting prices in 2023, while broadly sustaining its volume-premium balance. This is the big challenge for any rising producer: producing in higher volumes reduces costs, but erodes exclusivity and therefore the ability to retain premium pricing.

By early 2023 Tesla had captured about 20% of the EV market, substantially outperforming both volume and premium rivals and increasing share by around 2 percentage points year on year.

The Cybertruck probably won't unlock more growth in Europe, however. US pickups are a marginal product there, seen as unsuited to many European cities. Indeed, Paris is considering higher parking charges for EVs weighing over 2 tonnes, which would include the reputedly 3.3-ton Cybertruck.

Tesla vehicle sales by region (2022)

It is in the US that this vehicle really matters. Again, Tesla cut prices significantly there in early 2023. The company's ability to put pressure on rivals this way reflects its production experience and famous ownership of its supply chain. Tesla's unit sales in the US are up 26% year on year, but like in China it is losing share to competitors: down to 57% from 67% a year ago.

The US pick-up segment is important to Tesla's efforts to retain its premium brand positioning by expanding the product portfolio. but pick-ups are also vital source for the US'big three' manufacturers' profitability. Non-EVs are dominated by Ford (F-series), GM (Chevrolet Silverado) and Stellantis (Dodge Ram).

Those incumbents have not wasted time since the Cybertruck was announced. Ford launched the F-150 Lightning in May 2021, and by 2024 expects output to be 150,000 units per year . The niche GMC Hummer EV pick-up was launched by GM in 2022. GM's Silverado EV will also be on the market by mid-2024, as will the Dodge Ram in pure EV and range-extender formats.

Other disruptive new entrants have also been busy, although companies such as Lordstown Motors and Canoo have struggled. Most prominent, though still not profitable, is California-based Rivian with its R1T electric pick-up and R1S SUV variant. Rivian is expected to produce about 50,000 vehicles in 2023 overall.

Cybertruck prospects

Tesla has the luxury of a reported 2 million reservations for the Cybertruck, with a five-year waiting list. Nonetheless, the vehicle will test whether the company can continue combining volume with premium pricing.

There will now be two models, since the lowest-spec single-motor variant seems no more . The premium tri-motor Cybertruck will likely be priced at US$80,000. Some innovations in the two models, such as stainless-steel body panels, appear to be more marketing hype than engineering logic.

The styling is polarising, and may not appeal to a traditionally conservative segment. The performance claims are impressive, but possibly unnecessary - the ability to tow 6.4 tonnes will rarely be useful.

The Cybertruck will have a battery-technology edge for now, and access to the widespread and reliable Tesla supercharger network . Tesla aims to produce 200,000 units in 2024 and potentially 250,000 the year after. If that can be sustained, then the company will again have achieved premium positioning on a volume product.

At this stage, however, there are concerns. Early pre-production models were reported with multiple quality issues around the fit and finish, including large, variable panel gaps, and bubbles or other defects in the plastic film applied to the exterior panels. Those in the industry may recall the Ford Edsel . Unusual styling along with multiple initial production problems resulted in one of the classic industry disasters for this supposedly state-of-the-art car in the late 1950s.

A lot is riding on the Cybertruck. It will be increasingly difficult to achieve powerful growth on the back of the Model 3/Ys and Model S/Xs. Tesla has talked about introducing an entry-level EV at circa £18,000, but has not always delivered on past promises.

If this hasn't appeared by 2025, Tesla will have an ageing product line and a need to inject more excitement into the brand. It will be protecting its market share against a host of new rivals and resurgent legacy brands. Without a big Cybertruck success, the company will find it ever harder to straddle the volume-premium divide.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/27/TC_0d12bimage_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,7.491539,3b5e967f5fb37236dbf1e644c46568ff

Speaking at the Inmerge Innovation Summit, Jeffrey Brian Straubel, co-founder of the American Tesla Corporation, stressed that Azerbaijan is one of the countries occupying an important position in the global oil industry, Azernews reports.

Straubel emphasised that oil-rich countries must take steps to reduce carbon emissions.

''For me, that's the main point, and reducing carbon emissions is possible through technology. We regularly see news about the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions around the world. However, if you look at the statistics,'In 2018, we will see an increase in global carbon dioxide emissions, reaching record levels. I hope we will be able to take serious steps in this direction.''

Further, the co-founder has touched on challenges in reducing industrialization in our world.

""Decarbonising and rethinking industrial society requires divesting from fossil fuels, which is one of the most significant challenges of this generation,"" Straubel said.

""Often, we are reassured that CO2 emissions are under control or being reduced very quickly. We often see lots of commitments; everyone talks about reaching net zero soon, etc. But the reality is that every year we set records for CO2 emissions. Despite all the work done and all the promises and commitments, emissions are still increasing,"" he added.

The Tesla co-founder emphasised that it is not the emissions of one country or company that are increasing, but the total amount of emissions, which has an impact on everyone on Earth. Straubel also said that this year is likely to set another record for CO2 emissions.

Recall that Baku is hosting the second day of the InMerge Innovation Summit organised by PASHA Holding.

The second day of the summit will feature keynotes from co-founder and CTO of Tesla Inc., J.B. Strobel, and founder and creator of Shazam, Chris Barton.

A YouTuber took his 
Tesla
 on a road trip to Alaska through a 320-mile stretch of remote highway.
 
While some EV owners have shared 
horror stories
 about taking an 
electric car
 on a long road trip, Sandro van Kuijck, a YouTuber who has 
lived in his Tesla
 for the past year, has taken his EV into 49 different US states and told Business Insider he rarely experiences 
range anxiety.
 
The YouTuber said he decided to put his Model X to the ultimate test by taking it to one of the most remote areas in the U.S.
 
""I wanted to show you can take an EV anywhere,"" van Kuijck said.
 
 
 
 Sandro van Kuijck took his Model X to Alaska for a 9-day trip.

Despite his experience with traveling with an EV, van Kuijck said his trip wasn't without some hiccups.
 
During his 9-day roundtrip from Oregon to Alaska, van Kuijck said he had to be wary of the range on his Model X, especially when he took the EV through a dead zone — about a 320-mile stretch of the Alcan Highway — where van Kuijck said he lost cell service and was unable to find a public charger.
 
""You should be able to make it with Model X range, but because the elevation changes are significant, you will not be able to make it even if the car tells you you can,"" van Kuijck said. ""If you don't plan ahead you could potentially be stuck.""
 
The Model X has an 
advertised
 range of about 348 miles, according to 
Tesla's website
. But any number of factor can cause the range to drop, including extreme temperatures.
 
The YouTuber said in the month that he prepared for the road trip he'd learned the range on his Tesla wouldn't be able to cut it due to the cold environment and steep roads. Instead of trying to make a go of the stretch of highway in one day, van Kuijck said he stopped midway to trickle-charge his Model X at an RV site overnight on his way into Alaska.
 
""I wasn't panicked,"" van Kuijck said. ""I was willing to wait however long it took to charge.""
 
The YouTuber said he ended up needing only an additional 10% of 
battery
 life to thread the needle and make it through the dead zone.
 
Later, when he made his way back along the same stretch of highway on his way home, the YouTuber said he drove near the minimum speed on the highway — clocking 42 miles per hour in a 65 miles per hour zone — in order to conserve battery. Van Kuijck said he also turned off the climate control in his car and unplugged his external battery, eventually stopping at a nearby lodge to charge.
 
Without service, van Kuijck said he wasn't able to use his Tesla map during the two-day stretch on the way there and back. The Tesla system couldn't plot out the charging stations along his route without access to 
GPS
 and cell services.
 
'The car was really confused,"" van Kuijck said. ""It would tell me that I can make the charging stops and then halfway through it tells me I won't make it and then I have to turn back around.""
 
 
 
 Sandro van Kuijck said the navigation system on his Tesla didn't work for portions of the Alcan Highway.

Van Kuijck added that he wouldn't have been able to make the trip if he'd left a month later because the RV site and lodge where he'd charged mid-way through the stretch of highway closes after the first snowfall of the season.

Despite some of the difficulties he faced along the way, van Kuijck said he was surprised to see other EV owners in Alaska, including another Tesla owner who 
lived in his Model Y.
 
""It is very difficult to get up there and back, but it's totally doable if you have some patience and you're open to the adventure,"" van Kuijck said.

While the entry-level rear-wheel drive is priced at USD 60,990, the mid-spec all-wheel drive is available for USD 79,990 and the top-spec Cyberbeast variant for USD 99,990. Although the rear-wheel drive variant will not be available till 2025, the other two can be had in 2024.
The current price of the Tesla Cybertruck is much higher than what was announced by the company in 2019 when it was unveiled. At that time, the entry-level variant was priced at USD 39,900.
Tesla has already garnered over 1 million orders for the Cybertruck. The company now has five models in its portfolio -- Model 3, Model S, Model X, Model Y and Cybertruck.
The Cybertruck is the first Tesla vehicle to be launched since the introduction of the Model Y in 2020. The company had initially planned to start the deliveries of the Cybertruck in 2021. However, there were delays due to production issues arising from the electric pickup truck's unconventional design.",indiatoday.in,1817,news,IN,en,India Today Auto Desk,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202312/tesla-cybertruck-vs-porsche-911-014325578-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=DTwbjydOvyW5.OGKEfpYKfRVzKBmGWkK,False,@indiatoday,6.700803,dbdcd19169327c379604a3b3d5ed497e

Decarbonizing and reinventing industrial society requires divesting from fossil carbon, one of the most significant challenges of the current generation, said Tesla Inc. co-founder and chief technical officer Jeffrey Brian Straubel at the ongoing InMerge Innovation Summit in Baku, Trend reports.

""Often we are convinced that CO2 emissions are under control or being reduced rapidly. We often witness a lot of commitments, everyone talks about reaching net zero emissions soon, etc. But the reality is that every year we set record CO2 emissions. Despite all the work done, all the promises and commitments, the emission is still increasing,"" he said.

Straubel emphasized that it is not the emissions of one country or company that are increasing, but their total amount, which has an impact on everyone on Earth.

According to him, this year is likely to set another record for CO2 emissions.

InMerge, considered the largest innovation summit in the region, is designed to bring together leading companies, startups, and investors to discuss the topic of innovation and possible collaborations.

The summit is taking place in Baku from November 30 through December 1.

Dao has undertaken an extraordinary feat, crafting a fully functional wooden replica of the much-anticipated Tesla Cybertruck. With an investment of a staggering Rs 12 lakh (approximately $15,000) and a dedicated 100-day journey, Dao has transformed his passion for woodworking into a testament to automotive artistry.
Dao's woodworking prowess extends beyond the Cybertruck as he has formed an entire collection of functional wooden vehicles in the past. This lineup includes a tank, a Bugatti replica, and even a child-sized Mercedes AVTR, showcasing not only Dao's exceptional skills but also his deep passion for automotive craftsmanship. Inspired by his admiration for Elon Musk, Dao took on the ambitious Cybertruck project and even documented the process on his YouTube channel, ND-Woodworking Art.
The craftsmanship began with the creation of a metal chassis, frame, and wheels, onto which Dao added crafted wooden panels, seats, and wheel trims. The finishing touches included LED blinkers and an illuminated ""X"" logo on one of the doors. Dao emphasized the waterproof nature of the wood, ensuring both functionality and durability for his unique creation.
Going above and beyond, Dao also crafted a functional Cyberquad, fitting into the wooden pick-up truck replica. This inventive addition allows Dao's young son to join the family in style, creating an immersive experience that goes beyond conventional woodworking. The video that he made swiftly garnered attention on social media platforms, amassing over 70 million views on TikTok alone. Users praised Dao's craftsmanship, with one enthusiast suggesting, ""Tesla should be taking notes about the fit and finish of this thing.""
In a remarkable turn of events, Dao reached out to Elon Musk and Tesla, expressing admiration and offering the wooden Cybertruck as a heartfelt gift. Elon Musk, known for his active engagement with the Tesla community, responded positively to Dao's tweet, expressing appreciation with a ""Sure, much appreciated,"" accompanied by a heart emoji. Dao described the moment as ""truly indescribable.""
Currently, he is in communication with Tesla to arrange the shipping of the wooden Cybertruck to the US. Moreover, Dao has also been extended an invitation to the official Tesla Cybertruck launch on Thursday by the President of the Tesla car owners club. This unexpected recognition from Tesla adds another remarkable chapter to Dao's journey, illustrating that craftsmanship and creativity possess the power to capture the attention of even the most influential figures in the automotive industry.",indiatoday.in,1817,business,IN,en,Ankita Garg,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202311/tesla-27530143-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=Bv0ObBc2Kies5WugS2E52kCjO.Py8Sa3,False,@indiatoday,6.397021,f857ea5252ff483daa7cd16fa9da1b2f

The design is bold. Not just due to the unusual shape and the stainless steel finish, but also in the product offerings. The stainless steel panels and finish are reminiscent of the ill-fated DeLorean DMC-12 that, while beloved for its starring role in the Back to the Future franchise, was otherwise disastrous for the company and a rather lackluster car with many issues.

The angular shape, flat surfaces and triangular roof line of the Cybertruck look like nothing else currently on sale. The vehicle is very different from the traditional Tesla lineup of cars that are more curved and jelly mold-like in their appearance. This means they're highly aerodynamic, with reduced drag to maximize their electric range.

Inconsistent brand identity

Automotive manufacturers typically have a design language that underscores all of their vehicles, clearly indicating the brand. This could be signified by a consistent grille design or the shape and form of their cars. Take, for example, the kidney-shaped grille on BMWs – or Mazda's 'Kodo' design philosophy , which aims to evoke motion even when the car has stopped.

However, Tesla seems to have designed the Cybertruck to bear no resemblance to any of its other offerings. Externally, at least, there's no clear brand consistency.

Sure, pickups often look different from cars made by the same company due to their differing functions, however even the Tesla Semi , a heavy goods vehicle, retains the jelly-mold styling and associated aerodynamic benefits of the Tesla cars. Considering the aesthetics of the existing Tesla lineup, the Cybertruck doesn't really fit in.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/07/AT_2e064image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.034207,bbadf374b8c1fe016abc00b647aae515

 is getting closer to a sub-$30,000 car. 
Brandon Bell/Getty Images
 
 
 
Elon Musk
 is already looking forward to the next addition to Tesla's growing fleet of vehicles.
 
The 
Tesla
 CEO told automotive manufacturing expert Sandy Munro that the long-awaited $25,000 Tesla is nearing reality in an interview posted to YouTube following the 
Cybertruck's launch party. 
 
Musk said his company is ""quite advanced"" in its work on the affordable Tesla, and that he is reviewing production plans weekly.
 
""The revolution in manufacturing that will be represented by that car will blow people's minds,"" Musk said. ""It is not like any car production line that anyone's ever seen.""
 
Musk has 
teased a sub-$30,000 Tesla since 2020
. At the time, he said the more attainable price point could be achieved by halving 
battery
 and cell manufacturing costs.
 
He told Munro that the 
new vehicle
 is currently slated for the Texas Gigafactory, where the Cybertruck is currently produced, with a secondary assembly line at the company's 
planned plant in Mexico. 
 
If Tesla gets to the $25,000 EV first, Detroit is in trouble
 
The U.S. 
electric vehicle
 market has 
undergone some serious changes
 in the last 12 months, with the shopping base for these vehicles changing over from wealthy early adopters to 
more practical buyers 
looking to switch from gas to electric power.
 
That has elevated the need for more 
affordable options in the EV space
, creating a gulf between where EV demand actually stands and which EVs are available to purchase today. Many car companies have responded to this change in demand by 
pulling back production plans
 while 
dealers
 lather on discounts to move these cars off their lots.
 
Tesla had led the way in a segment-wide dip in average EV prices this year, setting off a price war that has caused 
headaches for Ford
 and 
GM
 as these companies get their grand electric vehicle plans off the ground.
 
Adding more affordable options will only make it harder for Detroit car companies and other legacy automakers to compete with Tesla, especially since these companies still aren't turning a profit on their 
electric cars
.
 
Tesla buyers seem to be more price-sensitive
 
If the reaction to Cybertruck's pricing is any indication, Tesla itself is not safe from the changes in price sensitivity in the EV segment.
 
Pricing for the Cybertruck
 was finally released last week, with the cheapest option (not available until 2025) starting at almost $61,000 – $20,000 more expensive than Musk originally promised.
 
While these prices are in line with where EV 
truck
 prices stand right now, some 
order holders told Business Insider
 they were counting on a more affordable option with the Cybertruck.

Tesla remains non-unionized globally, but Swedish workers are advocating for the company to engage in a collective bargaining agreement, a standard practice for most employees in Sweden. Although Tesla does not operate a manufacturing plant in Sweden, it maintains several service centers in the country.



The United Federation of Workers in Denmark, also known as 3F, declared their support for the Swedish workers and disclosed plans for a sympathy action. The move comes in response to speculation that Tesla might reroute its car deliveries through Danish ports after Swedish dockworkers obstructed the reception of Tesla cars in Sweden. The primary demand of the Swedish workers is for Tesla to enter into a collective bargaining agreement, aligning with established labor practices in the country.



In a statement, 3F outlined their concrete actions, stating that dock workers and drivers will refuse to receive and transport Tesla cars bound for Sweden, disrupting the previous model of delivery. Jakob Lykke, the local head of 3F Transport in Esbjerg, revealed that Tesla cars are exclusively received through the harbor in Denmark's fifth-largest town. Effective December 20, the union members will refrain from driving Tesla cars off the board, impacting not only the Swedish market but also potentially influencing the Danish market.



Jan Villadsen, the head of 3F, emphasized that this solidarity action is exerting additional pressure on Tesla. The hope is that the company will promptly engage in negotiations and agree to sign a collective bargaining agreement. The widening scope of the labor conflict, now involving both Swedish and Danish workers, reflects a coordinated effort to address workers' demands and emphasize the significance of fair labor practices within Tesla's operations in the region.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_Aviationtransport_166.jpg,False,@menafn,7.7040625,eba74f7ff1bdc2d81b8e199ba034827b

Model Y
 at the company's Fremont factory earlier this year.
 
The EV maker failed to ensure power was cut to a conveyor belt while workers were performing quality inspections, according to 
documents
 obtained by 
Bloomberg
 through a California Public Records Act request. As a result, in April, the worker became trapped in a car after its open door struck a fixed vertical gate at 

's Fremont plant, according to the documents.
 
California OSHA proposed fining  $18,000 for the 'serious' violation, which the regulator said the carmaker addressed during an inspection at some point between April and October. The company also received another $18,000 fine for failing to maintain an effective injury and illness prevention program, while it received two other $1,000 fines for 'general' violations at the plant.
 
The report comes as the 
United Auto Workers

In an interview with the BBC, Lukasz Krupski said his attempts to highlight his concerns around self-driving technology internally'had been ignored'.

Krupski said he was concerned about how AI was being used to power Tesla's autopilot service.

Its autopilot feature, for example, includes assisted steering and parking - but, despite its name, it does still require someone in the driver's seat with their hands on the wheel.

""I don't think the hardware is ready and the software is ready,"" he was quoted as saying.

""It affects all of us because we are essentially experiments on public roads. So even if you don't have a Tesla, your children still walk on the footpath,' Krupski added.

Tesla did not comment on the report.

According to Musk, ""Tesla has by far the best real-world AI'.

Krupski reportedly found evidence in company data which suggested that requirements relating to the'safe operation of vehicles that had a certain level of autonomous or assistive-driving technology had not been followed'.

According to Tesla's own data, US customers using Autopilot averaged one crash where the airbag deployed roughly every 5 million miles travelled in 2022.

The US Department of Justice is also investigating Tesla over its claims relating to its assisted driving features.

Everyone's favorite 'self-driving'
 car is experiencing technical issues…
again
. On Wednesday, Tesla issued a recall for over 2 million vehicles due to reported insufficiencies in the software designed to monitor a driver's attention while using the Autopilot function. It comes after a two-year 
investigation
 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of over 
1,000 crashes
 involving the self-driving function. A recent 
Washington Post
 
story
 also detailed at least eight Tesla crashes on roads where Autopilot should not have been engaged. 


If you own one of the following models, according to NHTSA, your car could experience technical difficulties:




TESLA/MODEL 3/2017-2023


TESLA/MODEL S/2012-2023


TESLA/MODEL X/2016-2023


TESLA/MODEL Y/2020-2023




Thankfully, there appears to be an easy fix: a software update that the company will reportedly provide free of charge. However, this recall is just one more bullet point in the long list of safety issues involving vehicles over the past few years. As my former colleague  
reported
 last year, Tesla's Autopilot function has been linked to multiple deaths. 


In 2022, the NHSTA 
reported
 that Tesla made up over 68 percent of the 392 crashes involving vehicles with an advanced driver assistance system. On December 10, the 
Washington Post
 claimed that issues with the car's 'Autosteer' function—an element of the self-driving Autopilot function—go beyond driver inattention, citing dash cam footage from a 2019 crash showing a Tesla 'blowing through a stop sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends.'  In a statement

Tesla probed its battery supply scheme earlier in the year and managed to convince the Treasury Department that all of its cars are 
eligible
 for the full US$7,500 EV tax credit amount. Despite that its bestselling vehicles like the Model 3 and Model Y use Chinese LFP batteries, fleetwide the total amount of raw materials sourced from non-eligible entities may have stayed under the government's 40% threshold. 


President Biden's administration, however, just released its EV tax credit eligibility guidance for next year, confirming that some Tesla cars won't qualify for the full government subsidy, most likely because the battery raw materials threshold goes to 50% in 2024. 


Tesla immediately put out a warning that the ""
$7,500 tax credit will reduce to $3,750 for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on Jan 1, 2024
,"" indicating which versions will no longer be eligible for the full federal subsidy. 


The Tesla 
Model 3 Highland
 facelift, which is scheduled for 
US release
 in Q1, may only qualify for 50% of the tax credit, too, as it is powered by CATL's 
M3P
 phosphate batteries. The US-made Model Y, however, will seemingly stay eligible for the full tax credit amount. 


On the other hand, the EV subsidy guidelines issued Friday leave some wiggle room for US automakers like Ford, which plans to invest billions in US battery factories by 
licensing
 LFP technology from CATL. Otherwise, the Treasury's ""foreign entity of concern"" ineligibility clarification now includes anything sourced from China-based companies, US subsidiaries notwithstanding, as well as from any foreign firms that have at least 25% Chinese government stake. 


Needless to say, the licensing deals exemption irked some lawmakers like Senator Joe Manchin who said that the new guidelines don't go nearly far enough and will leave too many EVs with Chinese materials eligible for tax credit still. A trade group that lobbies on behalf of Japanese, South Korean, or German automakers, however, said they ""
appreciate the clarity today's guidance provides and the flexibility it creates
"" for its clients, as the government has tried to balance everyone's interest.",notebookcheck.net,5474,business,AT,en,Daniel Zlatev,https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc4/tesla-model-3-highland-flame-red.jpg,False,,6.041597,cb9deac0b75b99f393281e632a05c164

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

711,"Tesla drivers run Autopilot where it's not intended, with deadly consequences",Trisha Thadani,2023-12-12 00:00:00,date,https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/301025348/tesla-drivers-run-autopilot-where-its-not-intended-with-deadly-consequences,stuff.co.nz,At least eight fatal or serious Tesla crashes in the US occurred on roads where Autopilot should not have been enabled in the first place.,"After a long day of fishing in Key Largo, Florida, Dillon Angulo and Naibel Benavides Leon pulled to the side of the road and hopped out of their Chevy Tahoe to look at the stars. Suddenly, Angulo said, the ""whole world just fell down.""
 A Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about 110kph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was ""driving on cruise"" and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.
 But the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It occurred on a rural road where 
Tesla's Autopilot technology
 was not designed to be used. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and obtained exclusively by The Washington Post shows the car blowing through a stop sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends and drivers must turn left or right.
At left, a screenshot from a body cam shows Dillon Anguloâ€™s Chevy Tahoe after police arrived at the scene of the crash. At right, Anguloâ€™s Chevy Tahoe after the crash.
 The crash is 
one of at least eight fatal or serious wrecks involving Tesla Autopilot
 on roads where the driver assistance software could not reliably operate, according to a Post analysis of two federal databases, legal records and other public documents. The first crash occurred in 2016, when a Tesla plowed under a semi-truck on a U.S. route in Florida. The most recent was in March when a Tesla in Autopilot failed to slow down, police said, and hit a teenager stepping off a North Carolina school bus at  than 70kph.
 In user manuals, legal documents and communications with federal regulators, Tesla has acknowledged that Autosteer, Autopilot's key feature, is ""intended for use on controlled-access highways"" with ""a center divider, clear lane markings, and no cross traffic."" Tesla advises drivers that the technology can also falter on roads if there are hills or sharp curves, according to its user manual. Even though the company has the technical ability to limit Autopilot's availability by geography, it has taken few definitive steps to restrict use of the software.
 Nor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, 
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
 called for limits on where driver-assistance technology could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, NTSB has no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto safety standards - but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.
Dillion Angulo suffered a brain injury, a broken jaw and a broken pelvic bone in the 2019 crash that also killed his girlfriend.
 In an October interview, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the 2016 crash should have spurred NHTSA to create enforceable rules around where Tesla's technology could be activated. The inaction, she said, reflects ""a real failure of the system.""
 ""If the manufacturer isn't going to take safety seriously, it is up to the federal government to make sure that they are standing up for others to ensure safety,"" Homendy said. But ""safety does not seem to be the priority when it comes to Tesla.""
 Of NHTSA, Homendy added, ""How many  people have to die before you take action as an agency?""
 In a statement to The Post, NHTSA said the agency ""always welcomes the NTSB's input and carefully reviews it - especially when considering potential regulatory actions. As a public health, regulatory and safety agency, safety is our top priority.""
 NHTSA said it would be too complex and resource-intensive to verify that systems such as Tesla Autopilot are used within the conditions for which they are designed, and it potentially would not fix the problem.
 Homendy was sceptical of that explanation, saying agencies and industries frequently respond to NTSB recommendations by citing the impossibility of their requests - until additional carnage forces their hand.
 NHTSA said it is focused instead on ensuring drivers are fully engaged while using advanced driver-assistance systems.
 Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. In court cases and public statements, the company has repeatedly argued that it is not liable for crashes involving Autopilot, because the driver is ultimately responsible for the trajectory of the car. After a fatal crash in 2018, Tesla told NTSB that design limits for Autopilot would not be appropriate because ""the driver determines the acceptable operating environment.""
 The string of Autopilot crashes reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly evolving technology to operate on the nation's roadways without significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics argue the agency's approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed technology to put Tesla drivers - and those around them - at risk.
 The approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment - such as recurring issues with Boeing's 737 Max - have resulted in sweeping action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a process called ""type certification,"" passenger car models are not prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to meet.
Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self Driving systems are not to be confused with each other. The latter is  sophisticated, but also known to have its issues.
 NHTSA's approach also contrasts with how some states, localities and even companies have responded to incidents involving autonomous vehicles. After a fatal crash in 2018, Uber halted its driverless program amid official scrutiny by NTSB before offloading the program entirely. And in October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended permits for driverless car company Cruise after one of its cars dragged a jaywalking pedestrian about 20 feet after she had been hit by a regular car. Cruise also grounded its entire U.S. fleet and issued a voluntary recall.
 Steven Cliff, a former NHTSA chief who left the agency last year, acknowledged the approach taken by regulators can appear too cautious at times, but said the agency was aggressive under his watch - mandating companies such as Tesla report their data on crashes involving advanced-driver assistance-systems.
 But advancing from the data collection stage to a final rule, where new regulations are adopted if necessary, can take years, he said.
 ""Tesla's philosophy is, let the operator determine for themselves what is safe but provide that operator a lot of flexibility to make that determination,"" he said.
 He said Tesla could easily limit where the technology can be deployed. ""The Tesla knows where it is. It has navigation. It knows if it's on an interstate or an area where the technology wasn't designed to be used,"" he said. ""If it wasn't designed to be used there, then why can you use it there?""
 
'Operational Design Domain'
 In all, The Post has identified about 40 fatal or serious crashes since 2016 involving Tesla's driver assistance software; the bulk of them were identified through NHTSA's data, and the rest surfaced through lawsuits. Many occurred on controlled-access highways. But at least eight occurred on roads where Autopilot was not designed to be used.
 In another six crashes, it was unclear whether the Tesla driver had engaged Autopilot or the  sophisticated Full Self-Driving mode. Full Self-Driving is designed to recognize stop signs, traffic lights, cross traffic and other hazards on surface streets.
 After the 2019 Key Largo crash, Angulo filed a lawsuit arguing that Tesla's marketing creates a false sense of complacency for drivers, setting the stage for the crash that killed his girlfriend. The suit also accuses Tesla of negligence, including for the ability to activate the feature outside of its so-called ""Operational Design Domain,"" which is an industry term for the specific locations and sets of circumstances for which Autopilot is designed. It is one of about 10 such cases expected to go to trial over the next year.
 As a result of the crash, Angulo suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken jaw and a broken pelvic bone, amongst other injuries. Even today, he said, the sight of a Tesla makes him wince.
Tesla's updated Model 3 recently launched in New Zealand.
 ""How could they allow something like this on the road?"" Angulo said in an interview. ""It's like a deadly weapon just driving around everywhere. And people, pedestrians like me, how are we supposed to know stuff like this? It shouldn't be allowed.""
 In a sworn deposition last year first detailed by Reuters and obtained by The Post, Tesla's head of Autopilot, Ashok Elluswamy, said he was unaware of any document describing limitations on where and under what conditions the feature could operate. He said he was aware of some activation conditions for Autopilot, including the presence of lane lines, and that it is safe for ""anyone who is using the system appropriately.""
 But he said he did not know what the term ""Operational Design Domain"" means. ""I've heard those words before, but I do not recall much  than that,"" he said.
 Tesla's commitment to driver independence and responsibility is different from some competitors, whose driver-assistance technologies are loaded with high-definition maps with rigorous levels of detail that can tip vehicles off to potential roadway hazards and obstructions. Some manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors, also only allow the technology to work on compatible roadways that have been meticulously mapped.
 Tesla relies on  rudimentary maps, The Post has previously reported. And its software has been found to contain exceptions to Autopilot rules in some locations, according to a former Tesla employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. For example, the software could be activated on the Embarcadero in San Francisco, a busy and fast-moving street along the water where pedestrians and bicyclists flock, the person said.
 In 2022, a company supervisor was made aware that Autopilot could be activated in locations that were not controlled-access highways, according to the former employee. The software was interpreting Kato Road in Fremont, Calif. - a public thoroughfare adjacent to Tesla's factory - as a private road so employees could test Tesla's ""Summon"" feature, which allows owners to hail their vehicles from a parking spot with no one in the driver's seat.
 Summon is supposed to be limited to private property, and the employee said he raised the matter with a supervisor. Tesla fixed the loophole soon after, the person said.
Elon's latest electric car touches down in New Zealand with new looks,  tech, and the weirdest indicators in the world.
 
'Sensible safeguards'
 Over the years, NTSB has repeatedly called on NHTSA to rein in Autopilot. It also has urged the company to act, but Homendy said Tesla has been uniquely difficult to deal with when it comes to safety recommendations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk once hung up on former NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt, said the former chief, who retired from the agency in 2021 when Homendy took over.
 Sumwalt led NTSB when the agency released its investigation of the first fatal crash involving Autopilot, which resulted in a 2017 report calling on automakers including Tesla to equip their driver-assistance systems with ""safeguards"" that limit use of the technology to ""conditions for which they were designed."" It also called on NHTSA to create binding rules that limit the technology's use.
 In 2020, NTSB issued a report on another fatal Tesla crash the prior year that cited both the semi-truck driver, who ran a stop sign, and the Tesla driver's ""over reliance"" on Autopilot as probable causes of the crash. NTSB also cited NHTSA for the first time, saying its failure to ""develop a method"" that would ""limit the use of automated vehicle control systems to the conditions for which they were designed"" contributed to the crash.
 In 2021, NTSB sent another letter to NHTSA about Autopilot, calling on the agency to ""include sensible safeguards, protocols, and minimum performance standards to ensure the safety of motorists and other vulnerable road users.""
Elizabeth Frantz/For The Washington Post
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk.
 Last year, several senators joined the chorus, saying they were ""deeply troubled"" by the number of Autopilot crashes. They called on NHTSA to ""use all its investigative and regulatory authorities to shed needed light on this out-of-control industry and impose guardrails to prevent  deadly crashes.""
 NHTSA has implemented some of NTSB's recommendations, including increased data reporting for crashes involving autonomous and driver-assistance software. Meanwhile, NHTSA has an ""active investigation"" into Tesla's Autopilot, and it issued a recall on certain Tesla models equipped with Full Self Driving after determining that it ""led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety based on insufficient adherence to traffic safety laws.""
 But NHTSA has not adopted any rules that would limit the technology to where it is meant to be used, despite exploring how it could ensure such software adheres to its design limits.
 In one of her latest attempts to spur action, Homendy sent a letter directly to Musk in August 2021. She urged him to implement safeguards to ""limit"" the technology to conditions it was designed for, among other recommendations.
 ""If you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design,"" she wrote, ""I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued to you four years ago.""
 Musk, she said, never responded.

(Photo by John Anderson)
 
 


Tesla
 
recalled
 nearly all of its vehicles today – close to 2 million – in response to a two-year 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
 investigation into its partially self-driving Autopilot system.
 
Tesla will provide a software update to owners of models Y, S, 3, and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and Dec. 7, 2023, that will increase warnings and alerts to drivers, in an attempt to get them to pay better attention to the road. It will also limit where Tesla's Autosteer software can be used and potentially suspend drivers from using it if they repeatedly fail to 'demonstrate… driving responsibility.'
 
CEO 
Elon Musk
 took to X (formerly Twitter) in February to complain about people calling the NHTSA's software updates 'recalls,' 
writing
 that defining them as such is 'anachronistic and just flat wrong!' However, part of drivers' confusion might stem from another misnomer: Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving car systems are not actually fully self-driving; the Tesla website says they 'are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment… currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.' Musk has long touted fully autonomous vehicles as safer than human drivers, and 
said
 he expects to roll out truly fully self-driving cars this year. The timeline used to be by 2020, however, and continues to be moved up due to repeated safety issues. 
 
In 
February
 of this year, Tesla recalled 363,000 cars with the Full Self-Driving software in response to glitches causing them to not obey speed limits or come to full stops at intersections. Before that, the NHTSA launched their investigation in August 2021 in response to several accidents during which drivers using the Autopilot software crashed into emergency vehicles stopped for a call. Since 2016, 30 crashes involving Tesla Autopilot resulted in 14 deaths. Tesla does not agree with the NHTSA's analysis of its issues but has agreed to the recall in order to resolve the investigation, according to 
AP News

This feature will allow Tesla cars to park themselves without a driver even behind the wheels.

In response to a post on X, Musk noted that Tesla is working on a feature that will allow the car to recognise potential parking places and allow users to choose one by tapping on it. After selecting a parking space, the driver can leave the vehicle and the car will park itself.

""We are working on a feature where the car identifies probable viable parking spaces. You tap on one, exit the vehicle and it parks there,"" he wrote.

Tesla owners who purchased their vehicles prior to the discontinuation of Ultrasonic Sensors (USS) can use a similar option called ""Autopark"".

However, Autopark does not allow users to choose among several parking locations, and drivers must remain in the vehicle and be prepared to take control if necessary.

Meanwhile, Tesla has announced a number of new updates, including one that allows its vehicles to call 911 automatically if the car's airbags deploy in a crash.

Tesla announced the 2023 Holiday Update on X that will start rolling out this week.

The company highlighted features like Apple Podcasts support, rear-screen Bluetooth headset support, an updated version of the park assistance with 3D visuals, and new blind spot indicators.

The recall applies to nearly every Tesla vehicle sold in the US since the Autopilot feature was introduced way back in 2015.

Tesla would send a software update ""over the air"" to fix the issue.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in the recall notice that at no cost to customers, affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy, which is expected to begin deploying to certain affected vehicles on or shortly after December 12.

'The update happens automatically and does not require a visit to a dealership or garage, but is still referred to by the US regulator as a recall,' said the US agency.

Tesla defended the safety of Autopilot in a post on X.

""Safety metrics are emphatically stronger when Autopilot is engaged than when not engaged"" the company said.

The NHTSA said in its recall notice that in Tesla's Autopilot system, Autosteer is an SAE Level 2 advanced driver-assistance feature that can provide steering, braking and acceleration support to the driver subject to certain limited operating conditions.

'In certain circumstances when Autosteer is engaged, the prominence and scope of the feature's controls may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse of the SAE Level 2 advanced driver-assistance feature,' said the US agency.

In certain circumstances when Autosteer is engaged, if a driver misuses the SAE Level 2 advanced driver-assistance feature and/or fail to recognize when the feature is operating in situations where its functionality may be limited,'there may be an increased risk of a collision'.

On August 13, 2021, the NHTSA opened a preliminary probe into 11 incidents involving stationary first-responder vehicles and Tesla vehicles that were operating with Autosteer engaged.

While not concurring with the agency's analysis, Tesla determined to voluntarily administer a recall.

As of December 8, Tesla had identified 9 warranty claims.

716,Virginia sheriff's office says Tesla was running on Autopilot moments before tractor-trailer crash,Associated Press,2023-12-12 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/12/12/virginia-sheriffs-office-says-tesla-was-running-on-autopilot-moments-before-tractor-trailer-crash,ny1.com,Virginia authorities have determined that a Tesla was operating on its Autopilot system and was speeding in the moments leading to a crash with a crossing tractor-trailer last July that killed the…,"DETROIT (AP) — Virginia authorities have determined that a Tesla was operating on its Autopilot system and was speeding in the moments leading to a crash with a crossing tractor-trailer last July that killed the Tesla driver.
 
The death of Pablo Teodoro III, 57, is the third since 2016 in which a Tesla that was using Autopilot ran underneath a crossing tractor-trailer, raising questions about the partially automated system's safety and where it should be allowed to operate.
 
The crash south of Washington remains under investigation by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sent investigators to Virginia last summer and began a broader probe of Autopilot more than two years ago. 
 
Jeffrey Long, spokesman for the Fauquier County Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday that investigators determined Autopilot was in use on Teodoro's Tesla Model Y by downloading information from the vehicle's event data recorder. 
 
Sheriff's investigators used a search warrant to get access to the recorder in late July. Authorities released some of the results this week after an inquiry by The Associated Press.
 
The Tesla was traveling 70 mph (112.7 kilometers per hour) on four-lane U.S. 29 near Opal, and was 25 mph over the 45 mph speed limit in that area, Long said. The road has a median and can be accessed at intersections and from driveways. 
 
Long said Teodoro took action in the second before the crash, but he was not sure if that deactivated the system. He did not know what action Teodoro took, but said brakes were applied just one second before impact, slowing the vehicle a little. 
 
He said he could not release the speed at impact or say whether Teodoro or the Tesla applied the brakes because his office is working with NHTSA on its ongoing investigation.
 
Prior to the crash, the Tesla warned Teodoro to take control of the car because it detected something in the way. But neither the car, which is equipped with Automatic Emergency Braking, nor Teodoro stopped it in time to avoid the crash.
 
Long said an accident investigator's analysis of the data recorder 'indicated that the system was aware of something in the roadway and was sending messages' to the driver.
 
'Our investigation also determined that the driver would have had adequate time and distance to avoid the crash had he been traveling at the speed limit,' Long said in a statement. 'The full investigation concluded that the driver would have had more than adequate time to brake and even come to a complete stop.'
 
Initially the truck driver in the crash was charged with reckless driving for creating a barrier to traffic, Long said, but the charge was dropped in October by the commonwealth attorney at the request of the Sheriff's Office.
 
Under Virginia law, a driver gives up the legal right-of-way if they violate the speed limit, Long said.
 
The tractor-trailer was pulling from a truck stop onto the highway at the time of the crash, authorities said.
 
In October of 2021, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board called on Tesla to limit where Autopilot can operate and to put a better system in place to make sure drivers are paying attention.
 
Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote to CEO Elon Musk pointing out that her agency's investigation of a similar crash with a semi in 2016 found that Tesla allows its vehicles to run on Autopilot on roads where it wasn't designed to operate safety. An NTSB spokesman said Tuesday that Musk has not responded to Homendy's letter.
 
Tesla did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
 
Its website says Autopilot and a more sophisticated 'Full Self Driving' system cannot drive themselves and are meant to assist drivers who have to be ready to intervene at all times. 
 
With Autopilot, a Tesla can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane, the website says.
 
In a statement posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter, Tesla said safety is stronger when Autopilot is engaged. 
 
The Virginia crash brings to 35 the number of Tesla crashes under investigation by NHTSA since June of 2016. In all the cases, the agency suspects the Teslas were operating on a partially automated driving system. At least 17 people have died.
 
Recent crashes NHTSA is investigating include a July 5 head-on collision between a Tesla Model 3 and Subaru Impreza in South Lake Tahoe, California. The driver of the Subaru and an infant traveling in the Tesla were killed.
 
NHTSA also sent investigators to a March 15 crash in Halifax County, North Carolina, that injured a 17-year-old student. The State Highway Patrol said at the time that the driver of the 2022 Tesla Model Y, a 51-year-old male, failed to stop for the bus, which was displaying all of its activated warning devices.
 
A message was left seeking comment from the agency, which hasn't made public the results of its Tesla crash investigations.

There are ample movies that are based on the concept and have been widely enjoyed by people of all age groups for years. And it looks like Elon Musk is quite close to turning this concept into reality. 
Musk recently unveiled the Optimus Gen 2, a humanoid robot that can do much more than just walk and talk. The upgraded robot has faster walking speed, hand movements, tactile sensing on fingers, and much more. 
Elon Musk unveils Optimus Gen 2
Sharing a demo video of the robot on X, Musk simply wrote, ""Optimus."" 
The demo video begins with previous versions of the humanoid robots, that were introduced in 2021 and 2022. Now, the new humanoid, is much more advanced and can exercise, boil eggs, and even dance. The robot boasts a stylish design, resembling a human being. 
In the video, all these abilities of the humanoid robot are shown. Towards the end, there is a sweet surprise in store as the two Optimus Gen 2 robots are seen dancing. 
About Optimus previous generations
Tesla Optimus, also known as Tesla Bot, is a conceptual humanoid robot under development by Tesla. It was first announced at the company's AI Day event in 2021, and is intended to be a general-purpose robot capable of handling a wide range of tasks, particularly those that are unsafe, repetitive, or boring for humans.
Optimus is still in development, and Tesla has been releasing several updates showcasing its progress, with the Gen 2 being the latest one.
In 2022, Tesla had unveiled a prototype that could walk and perform simple tasks like picking up objects. ""This is literally the first time the robot was operated without [a tether] onstage tonight,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk had said back then as videos of the robot picking up objects and watering plants were displayed. ""We didn't want it to fall on its face,"" he added. 
While unveiling the robot in 2021, Tesla had said that it is powered by a custom Tesla computer chip and packs the processing punch needed for complex tasks. Similar to a smartphone, it stays connected with WiFi and LTE, allowing for remote updates and control. Audio capabilities ensure clear communication, while built-in cybersecurity features keep its operations safe.
Fuelling the machine is a 2.3 kilowatt-hour battery - which is much more efficient than traditional robots. This promises an extended operation without the need for frequent recharging. 
Then, in March this year, Optimus Gen 1 was unveiled. And in September, more details about the robot were shared. One of the things that caught attention was that the TeslaBot operates on end-to-end neural network, same technology that powers Tesla's electric cars. In a demo video, the TeslaBot was seen doing yoga.",indiatoday.in,1817,business,IN,en,Divyanshi Sharma,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202312/tesla-134113534-16x9_0.png?VersionId=A1aFieZ.8ycJebFyKsWXjabehmKdZRBL,False,@indiatoday,6.484413,d669bf5829b5f815fd02651b01c0a05c

The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use. Some were deadly.
The agency says its investigation found Autopilot's method of ensuring that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can lead to foreseeable misuse of the system. The recall covers nearly all of the vehicles Tesla sold in the U.S. and includes models Y, S, 3 and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and Dec. 7 of this year.
The software update includes additional controls and alerts ""to further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility,"" the documents said. The update was to be sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday, with the rest getting it at a later date, the documents said.

Autopilot includes features called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise Control, with Autosteer intended for use on limited access freeways when it's not operating with a more sophisticated feature called Autosteer on City Streets.
The software update apparently will limit where Autosteer can be used. ""If the driver attempts to engage Autosteer when conditions are not met for engagement, the feature will alert the driver it is unavailable through visual and audible alerts, and Autosteer will not engage,' the recall documents said.
Depending on a Tesla's hardware, the added controls include ""increasing prominence"" of visual alerts, simplifying how Autosteer is turned on and off, additional checks on whether Autosteer is being used outside of controlled access roads and when approaching traffic control devices, ""and eventual suspension from Autosteer use if the driver repeatedly fails to demonstrate continuous and sustained driving responsibility,"" the documents say.
Recall documents say that agency investigators met with Tesla starting in October to explain ""tentative conclusions"" about the fixing the monitoring system. Tesla, it said, did not agree with the agency's analysis but agreed to the recall on Dec. 5 in an effort to resolve the investigation.
Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether a driver's hands are on the steering wheel. They have called for cameras to make sure a driver is paying attention, which are used by many other automakers with similar systems.
Autopilot can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane, but is a driver-assist system and cannot drive itself despite its name. Independent tests have found that the monitoring system is easy to fool, so much that drivers have been caught while driving drunk or even sitting in the back seat.
In its defect report filed with the safety agency, Tesla said Autopilot's controls ""may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse."" A message was left early Wednesday seeking further comment from the Austin, Texas, company.

DETROIT — Tesla is recalling nearly all vehicles sold in the , more than 2 million, to update software and fix a defective system that's supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when using Autopilot.
 
Documents posted Wednesday by  safety regulators say the update will increase warnings and alerts to drivers and even limit the areas where basic versions of Autopilot can operate.
 
The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use. Some were deadly.
 
The agency says its investigation found Autopilot's method of making sure that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can lead to 'foreseeable misuse of the system.'
 
The added controls and alerts will 'further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility,' the documents said.
 
But safety experts said while the recall is a good step, it still makes the driver responsible and doesn't fix the underlying problem that Tesla's automated systems have trouble spotting and stopping for obstacles in their path.
 
The recall covers models Y, S, 3 and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and Dec. 7 of this year. The update was to be sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday, with the rest getting it later.

Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether a driver's hands are on the steering wheel. They have called for cameras to make sure a driver is paying attention, which are used by other automakers with similar systems.
 
Philip Koopman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety, called the software update a compromise that doesn't address a lack of night vision cameras to watch drivers' eyes, as well as Teslas failing to spot and stop for obstacles.
 
'The compromise is disappointing because it does not fix the problem that the older cars do not have adequate hardware for driver monitoring,' Koopman said.
 
Koopman and Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, contend that crashing into emergency vehicles is a safety defect that isn't addressed. 'It's not digging at the root of what the investigation is looking at,' Brooks said. 'It's not answering the question of why are Teslas on Autopilot not detecting and responding to emergency activity?'
 
Koopman said NHTSA apparently decided that the software change was the most it could get from the company, 'and the benefits of doing this now outweigh the costs of spending another year wrangling with Tesla.'
 
In its statement Wednesday, NHTSA said the investigation remains open 'as we monitor the efficacy of Tesla's remedies and continue to work with the automaker to ensure the highest level of safety.'

(MENAFN- The Conversation) Tesla has recalled 2 million US vehicles over concerns about its autopilot function . Autopilot is meant to help with manoeuvres such as steering and acceleration, but still needs input from the driver. It comes just a few days after a whistle-blowing former Tesla employee cast doubt on the safety of the autopilot function.

A simple internet search reveals several reported cases where the cars have made errors in identifying objects on the road. For instance, a Tesla car mistook an image of a stop sign on a billboard for the real thing and confused the yellow moon with a yellow traffic light.

There have also been numerous recent examples of problems with the'robotaxis' operating in San Francisco. It raises questions about whether the technology that enables vehicles to operate autonomously is ready for the real world.

The driving force behind self-driving vehicles is artificial intelligence (AI), yet current algorithms lack the human-like understanding and reasoning necessary for context when driving. This includes advanced contextual reasoning for interpreting complex visual cues such as obscured objects, and inferring unseen elements in the environment.

Social interaction

Furthermore, these vehicles must be capable of counterfactual reasoning –evaluating hypothetical scenarios and predicting potential outcomes. This is a crucial skill for decision making in dynamic driving situations.

For instance, when an autonomous vehicle (AV) approaches a busy intersection with traffic lights, it must not only obey the current traffic signals but also predict the actions of other road users and consider how those might change under different circumstances.

An example of this scenario is provided by a 2017 accident in which an Uber robotaxi drove through a yellow light in Arizona in 2017 and collided with another car. At the time, there were questions about whether a human driver would have approached the situation differently.

Additionally, social interaction – an area where humans excel and robots falter – is essential. For example, on urban roads with cars parked along both sides, it's not always clear who has the right of way and we use social skills to negotiate a fair way to proceed.

At roundabouts, it's common for several cars to arrive at once, making it unclear who has right of way . Again, social skills allow drivers to safely pull onto the roundabout.

To ensure seamless coexistence with AI-driven cars, we urgently need to develop groundbreaking algorithms capable of human-like thinking, social interaction, adaptation to new situations and learning with experience. Such algorithms would enable AI systems to comprehend nuanced human driver behaviour , react to unforeseen road conditions, prioritise decision making that factors in human values and interact socially with other road users.

As we integrate AI-driven vehicles into existing traffic, the kinds of standards we've been using to assess and validate the success of autonomous driving systems will become insufficient. There is a pressing need for new standards and mechanisms to assess the capabilities of these driverless cars.

Specific uses

These new protocols should provide more rigorous testing and validation methods, ensuring that AI-driven vehicles meet the highest standards of safety, performance and interoperability (where AI systems from different manufacturers can work'understand' and work together). In doing so, they will establish a foundation for a safer, more harmonious traffic environment where driverless and human-driven cars mix.

It would be a mistake to write off fully self-driving cars, even without the developments which are needed. There is still a place for them, albeit not as ubiquitously as the rapid spread of Tesla vehicles might indicate. We'll initially need them for specific uses such as autonomous shuttles and highway driving. Alternatively, they could be used in special environments with their own dedicated infrastructure .

For instance, autonomous buses could drive a predefined route with a dedicated lane . Autonomous trucks could also have a separate lane on motorways. However, it's crucial that uses focus on benefiting the entire community, not just a specific – usually wealthy – group in society.

To ensure autonomous vehicles are well integrated on our roads, we'll need a diverse groups of experts to enter into a dialogue. These include car manufacturers, policymakers, computer scientists, human and social behaviour scientists and engineers and governmental bodies, among others.

They must come together to address the current challenges . This collaboration should aim to create a robust framework that accounts for the complexity and variability of real-world driving scenarios.

It would involve developing industry-wide safety protocols and standards , shaped by input from all people with a stake in the matter and ensuring these standards can evolve as the technology advances.

The collaborative effort would also need to create open channels for sharing data and insights from real-world testing and simulations. It must also foster public trust through transparency and demonstrate the reliability and safety of AI systems in autonomous vehicles.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/14/TC_419aaimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,5.999926,e8a8159687e387e4db11a18d3725ab1a

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

energy-storage batteries
 in China moved forward on Friday with a signing ceremony for the land acquisition for a new factory in Shanghai, China's state media said.
 
Construction is scheduled to start early next year with production to come on line by the end of the year, the official Xinhua News Agency said. 
 
The factory won't build batteries for cars but for electric utilities and other companies to store power. Such storage units have become increasingly important with the growth in 
solar power
 and 
wind energy
, which only generate electricity when weather conditions are favorable and need to store it for when residential and commercial users need it.
 
The new factory will initially produce 10,000 of Tesla's Megapack units annually for sale worldwide, Xinhua said. 
 
The Tesla project is a rare piece of good news for the Chinese economy, which has seen 
a sharp drop in foreign investment
 this year. The Commerce Ministry said this week that foreign investment in the first 11 months of this year was down 10% compared with the same period last year. 
 
Foreign companies are worried about the Chinese government's increasing control over business on national security and other grounds, as well as growing U.S. restrictions on technology trade with China.
 
China is a major market and manufacturing center for Tesla, and the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has built close ties with Chinese officials even as U.S.-China relations soured. In May, he 
met the commerce minister
 and the 
then foreign minister
 in Beijing. 
 
Tesla built an electric vehicle plant in Shanghai in 2019 that assembles cars for China, Europe and other overseas markets. It is the No. 2 seller in the booming Chinese market for electric vehicles. The market leader is Chinese auto company BYD, which 
announced plans Friday
 to build electric vehicles in Hungary in what will be its first car factory in Europe.
 
Tesla sold 464,654 vehicles in China in the first 10 months of the year, up 37.5% over last year and accounting for 12% of China's electric vehicle sales, according to the China Passenger Car Association, the research arm of the China Automobile Dealers Association.
 
China is also by far the world leader in installing wind and solar capacity, making it a major market for energy storage.

Author: Francesco Biondi

(MENAFN- The Conversation) On Dec. 12, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a recall regarding Autosteer, a feature included in Tesla's semi-autonomous suite Autopilot, because'there may be an increased risk of a collision .'

The recall, which affects over two million vehicles in the United States, is a watershed moment in modern automotive history, as it affects nearly every Tesla on the road in the U.S.

Transport Canada extended the recall to 193,000 Tesla vehicles in Canada .

Tesla says only vehicles in the U.S. and Canada are affected by the recall.

Unlike technologies that can be defined as fully autonomous - like elevators where a user steps in and pushes a button - Autosteer is not an autonomous system, despite what drivers may think.

A 2018 study found that 40 per cent of drivers believed Tesla vehicles are capable of being fully self-driving . A similar study concluded that participants'rated [Autopilot] as entailing less responsibility for the human for steering than 'high automation,' and it was not different from 'autonomous' or 'self-driving' .'

Instead, Tesla Autopilot falls into the category of level 2, or semi-autonomous, systems . These system can handle vehicle steering and accelerating but the human driver must stay vigilant at all times.

PBS covers the safety issues that led to the December recall of Tesla vehicles in the United States and Canada.

Confusing communication

In human factors research , believing that a system can do something it can't is referred to as mode confusion . Mode confusion not only misleads the user, but also has direct safety implications, as in the 1992 Air Inter Flight 148 plane crash in France . That situation was the direct result of the pilot operating the aircraft system in a mode different from its original design.

Safety researchers have sounded the alarm about risks inherent to semi-autonomous systems . In fully manual and fully autonomous modes, it is clear who's responsible for driving: the human and the robot driver, respectively.

Semi-autonomous systems represent a grey area. The human driver believes the system is responsible for driving but, as lawyers representing Tesla have already successfully argued , it is not.

A second important factor is also the role of misleading information. The automotive industry as a whole has, for years, tiptoed around the actual capabilities of autonomous vehicle technology. In 2016, Mercedes Benz pulled a TV commercial off the air after criticism that it portrayed unrealistic self-driving capabilities .

More recently, Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot software at Tesla, said the 2016 video promoting its self-driving technology was faked .

False sense of security

Thinking that a system is fully autonomous creates a false sense of security that drivers may act on by losing vigilance or disengaging from the task of supervising the system's functioning. Investigations on prior accidents involving Tesla Autopilot showed that drivers' overrelience on the semi-autonomous system indeed contributed to some reported crashes .

The recall is a logical, albeit long-awaited, effort by transportation agencies to regulate a problem that researchers have attempted to draw attention to for years.

In her 2016 study, Mica Endsley, a pioneer in the research field on user automation, highlighted some potential safety risks of these systems . A more recent study published by my research group also shows the dangers that operating semi-autonomous systems pose to drivers' attention .

With the recall, Tesla will be releasing over-the-air software updates that are meant to'further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous supervisory responsibility whenever Autosteer is engaged.' These may include additional'visual alerts' and other additions to the system to help drivers stay vigilant while Autosteer is engaged.

In all, although this may be the first time regulators strike a direct, concrete blow at Tesla and its marketing, it won't be the last.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/19/TC_78bf3image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.1249905,ca1191f2ad413f54f768e49a0f340e51

Tesla's Cybertruck
 had a viral moment when it needed a rescue on a snowy hill from a Ford pickup.
 
Ford
 CEO Jim Farley took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to clarify that the video of the Cybertruck's off-roading troubles 
wasn't a promotional stunt
 for his company.
 
The U.S. Forest Service, on the other hand, shared a 
press release
 on Thursday saying the viral video could be a learning experience.
 
Responding to the viral video, Stanislaus National Forest supervisor Jason Kuiken invited Tesla executives to ""sit down at the table with us and develop an educational experience for new Cybertruck owners.""
 
""We feel confident that had the driver of the Cybertruck had a better understanding of the topographical feature indicated on our maps, practiced Leave No Trace principles, and generally been more prepared, this whole incident could have been not only avoided, but also provided much-needed education to many new off-road users,"" said Kuiken.
 
""Ha! Nobody knows how to throw shade better than the Forest Service,"" one user commented on 
Facebook
.
 
This isn't the first time that Tesla's off-road troubles have gone viral. In November, a video of a Cybertruck 
struggling to climb
 a dirt hill garnered over 8 million views.
 
In response, Ford CEO Jim Farley produced his own off-road demo of the

735,Musk and Tesla are battling unions across Scandinavia. What comes next in the labor dispute?,Associated Press,2023-12-20 00:00:00,date,https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/ap-online/2023/12/20/musk-and-tesla-are-battling-unions-across-scandinavia-what-comes-next-in-the-labor-dispute,baynews9.com,Tesla has found itself locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with union workers in Sweden and neighboring countries,"Tesla has found itself locked in an increasingly 
bitter dispute with union workers in Sweden
 and neighboring countries. The showdown pits the electric car maker's CEO Elon Musk, who's staunchly anti-union, against the strongly held labor ideals of Scandinavian countries. 
 
None of Tesla's workers anywhere in the world are unionized, raising questions about 
whether strikes could spread
 to other parts of Europe where employees commonly have collective bargaining rights — notably in Germany, Tesla's most important European market.
 
Here are key things to know about the union fight: 
 
HOW DID THE TESLA STRIKE GAIN STEAM?
 
About 130 mechanics at 10 Tesla garages across Sweden walked off the job on Oct. 27 over the company's refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement. Tesla doesn't have a factory in Sweden, but does have a network of service centers. 
 
Since the mechanics with the powerful Swedish metalworkers' union IF Metall went on strike, other workers around the country have joined in sympathy, withholding their services to pressure the company.
 
Members of the country's 
transport union
 say they'll stop collecting waste from Tesla service centers starting Sunday. Employees with 
supplier Hydro Extrusions
, which makes aluminum profiles, are refusing to make a component for Tesla cars.
 
Other unions say their members won't paint Tesla cars, 
clean the company's offices
 or 
service electrical systems
 at its workshops or any of its 70 charging stations in Sweden.
 
Postal workers have stopped delivering license plates for new Tesla vehicles, 
prompting Tesla to sue
 the Swedish Transport Agency, demanding that it be allowed to retrieve the plates, and PostNord, the company that delivers the registration numbers. Tesla lost an early battle in the case, which is still working through the courts.
 
The boycott has escalated by spreading to neighboring Nordic countries. Like in Sweden, 
dockworkers in Denmark
 won't unload Tesla vehicles arriving at ports. 
Unions in Finland
 and 
those in Norway
 have warned that workers at ports and workshops will join the strike if the dispute isn't resolved by Wednesday.
 
WHO ELSE IS PRESSURING MUSK?
 
A group of 16 institutional investors including KLP, Norway's biggest pension fund, and PensionDanmark, have written to Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm. They have urged the company to reconsider its approach to unions and asked for a meeting to discuss it further. 
 
PensionDanmark has sold its 476 million kroner ($70 million) stake in the carmaker, saying it's putting Tesla on its blacklist 'in the light of the conflict spreading to Denmark and Tesla's latest and very categorical denial to reach collective agreements in any country."" 
 
Paedagoernes Pension, Denmark's teachers' pension fund, sold its 242 million kroner ($35 million) stake in Tesla because it 'cannot compromise' on its core values, 
CEO Sune Schackenfeldt said in a statement
. 
 
The fund discussed workers' rights with Tesla in March, but Musk's 'hard course against the Nordic trade union movement' makes continued investment unsustainable, it said.
 
WHY ARE UNIONS SO IMPORTANT IN NORDIC COUNTRIES?
 
Sweden is one of the most highly unionized countries in Europe, with nine in 10 workers covered by collective agreements. 
 
Across Scandinavia, trade unions and employers negotiate deals on wages and working conditions, with almost no involvement from the state. It's a system that originated in the 1930s and is widely acknowledged as the backbone of a labor market model that has helped workers benefit from decades of economic prosperity. 
 
The system results in fewer strikes than in other 
countries like France
 and Germany, because negotiations are the first avenue to resolve disputes. 
 
Tesla's attempts to secure a quick win in the license plate clash through Swedish courts 'appears to be having precisely the opposite impact, making unions more steadfast and creating sympathetic actions across the country,' said Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst. 
 
Collective agreements allow 'for companies to operate on a level playing field, while avoiding the risk of any one employer distorting competition in the sector by imposing poor conditions on their employees,' the IF Metall union says.
 
In a famous example of this model's success, the Toys R Us toy chain started up in Sweden in 1995 and hired only nonunion workers. The chain refused to sign such collective agreements. It resulted in a three-month strike by the retail employees union that snowballed into an all-out boycott as other Swedish unions joined in sympathy strikes. The company eventually agreed to sign collective deals.
 
WHAT HAS MUSK SAID? 
 
He's never hidden his disdain for unions, 
writing, 'this is insane,'
 on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in response to a tweet about Swedish postal workers refusing to deliver license plates.
 
In the U.S., Musk has 
picked online fights
 with the United Auto Workers and vehemently battled union legal challenges to his company's actions.
 
'I disagree with the idea of unions,' Musk said in a November onstage interview with The New York Times. 'I just don't like anything which creates kind of a lords and peasants sort of thing.'
 
Musk, the world's wealthiest person, said that unions try to create negativity in a company, denying that Tesla has a wealth hierarchy largely because the company awards everyone stock options. 
 
'Everyone eats at the same table. Everyone parks in the same parking lot,' he said.
 
Musk has 
accused the UAW
 of driving General Motors and Chrysler into bankruptcy, costing many workers their jobs. He said that if Tesla becomes unionized, 'it will be because we deserve it and we've failed in some way.""
 
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. 
 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT? 
 
Watching from the sidelines are labor organizers in Germany, where Tesla opened its first European gigafactory in 2022. The plant in Grunheide, southeast of Berlin, employs 11,000 people. It makes both batteries and Model Y SUVs.
 
Germany is the company's biggest market in Europe, selling 55,000 vehicles so far this year, three times as many as in Sweden, according to data from Schmidt. 
 
Labor organizers are on a union drive to sign up Tesla workers and say the numbers are rising quickly. 
 
Workers and unions in Germany are banned from joining sympathy strikes, but that might 'act as a catalyst to German Tesla production line workers to join local unions that can strike a good deal for them,' Schmidt said. 
 
Germany's IG Metall 
union says
 it's concerned about occupational safety at the plant and has fielded reports from 'numerous employees' about accidents and health problems that resulted in high staff sickness rates. 
 
Christiane Benner, the union's newly elected chairwoman, has Tesla in her sights. 
 
'We don't allow union-free zones! Not even on Mars, Elon Musk!' she said in her 
inaugural speech
 in October.

736,Tesla's recall of 2 million vehicles to fix its Autopilot system uses technology that may not work,Associated Press,2023-12-20 00:00:00,date,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2023/dec/20/teslas-recall-of-2-million-vehicles-to-fix-its-autopilot-system-uses-technology-that-may-not-work-2643278.html,newindianexpress.com,"A better solution, experts say, would be to require Tesla to use cameras to monitor drivers' eyes to make sure they're watching the road.","DETROIT: Tesla's recall of more than 2 million of its electric vehicles — an effort to have drivers who use its Autopilot system pay closer attention to the road — relies on technology that research shows may not work as intended.
 
Tesla, the leading manufacturer of EVs,
 reluctantly agreed to the recall
 last week after a two-year investigation by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that Tesla's system to monitor drivers was defective and required a fix.
 
The system sends alerts to drivers if it fails to detect torque from hands on the steering wheel, a system that experts describe as ineffective.
 
Government documents filed by Tesla say the online software change will increase warnings and alerts to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. It also may limit the areas where the most commonly used versions of Autopilot can be used, though that isn't entirely clear in Tesla's documents.
 
NHTSA began its investigation in 2021, after receiving 11 reports that Teslas that were using the partially automated system crashed into parked emergency vehicles. Since 2016, the agency has sent investigators to at least 35 crashes in which Teslas that were suspected of operating on a partially automated driving system hit parked emergency vehicles, motorcyclists or tractor trailers that crossed in the vehicles' paths, causing a total of 17 deaths.
 
But research conducted by NHTSA, the National Transportation Safety Board and other investigators show that merely measuring torque on the steering wheel doesn't ensure that drivers are paying sufficient attention. Experts say night-vision cameras are needed to watch drivers' eyes to ensure they're looking at the road.
 
'I do have concerns about the solution,' said Jennifer Homendy, the chairwoman of the NTSB, which investigated two fatal Florida crashes involving Teslas on Autopilot in which neither the driver nor the system detected crossing tractor trailers. 'The technology, the way it worked, including with steering torque, was not sufficient to keep drivers' attention, and drivers disengaged.'
 
In addition, NHTSA's investigation found that out of 43 crashes it examined with detailed data available, 37 drivers had their hands on the wheel in the final second before their vehicles crashed, indicating that they weren't paying sufficient attention.
 
'Humans are poor at monitoring automated systems and intervening when something goes awry,' said Donald Slavik, a lawyer for plaintiffs in three lawsuits against Tesla over Autopilot. 'That's why the human factors studies have shown a significant delayed response under those conditions.'
 
Missy Cummings, a professor of engineering and computing at George Mason University who studies automated vehicles, said it's widely accepted by researchers that monitoring hands on the steering wheel is insufficient to ensure a driver's attention to the road.
 
'It's a proxy measure for attention and it's a poor measure of attention,' she said.
 
A better solution, experts say, would be to require Tesla to use cameras to monitor drivers' eyes to make sure they're watching the road. Some Teslas do have interior-facing cameras. But they don't see well at night, unlike those in General Motors or Ford driver monitoring systems, said Philip Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies vehicle automation safety.
 
Koopman noted that older Teslas lack such cameras.
 
Tesla's recall documents say nothing about increased use of cameras. But the company's software release notes posted on X, formerly Twitter, say that a camera above the rearview mirror can now determine whether a driver is paying attention and trigger alerts if they aren't. Tesla, which has no media relations department, didn't answer emailed questions about the release notes or other recall-related issues.
 
Tesla's website says that Autopilot and more sophisticated 'Full Self Driving' software cannot drive themselves and that drivers must be ready to intervene.
 
Experts say that although limiting where Autopilot can operate to controlled access highways would help, it's unclear whether Tesla will do so with its recall.
 
In the recall documents it filed with NHTSA, Tesla says its basic Autopilot includes systems called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise Control. The documents say that Autosteer is intended for use on controlled access highways and won't work when a driver activates it under the wrong conditions. The software update, the documents say, will have 'additional checks upon engaging Autosteer and while using the feature outside controlled access highways and when approaching traffic controls.'
 
Cummings noted that doesn't specifically say Tesla will limit areas where Autopilot can work to limited-access freeways — a concept known as 'geofenced.'
 
'When they say conditions, nowhere does that say geofenced,' she said.
 
Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, said she was able to use Autopilot on roads that weren't controlled access highways while testing a Tesla Model S that received the software update. But it's difficult, she said, to test everything else in the recall because Tesla has been vague on exactly what it's changing.
 
Homendy, the chairwoman of the transportation safety board, said she hopes NHTSA has reviewed Tesla's solution to determine whether it does what the agency intended it to do.
 
The NTSB, which can make only recommendations, will investigate if it sees a problem with Teslas that received the recall repairs, Homendy said.
 
Veronica Morales, NHTSA's communications director, said the agency doesn't pre-approve recall fixes because federal law puts the burden on the automaker to develop and implement repairs. But she said the agency is keeping its investigation open and will monitor Tesla's software or hardware fixes to make sure they work by testing them at NHTSA's research and testing center in Ohio, where it has several Teslas available.
 
The agency received the software update on its vehicles only a few days ago and has yet to evaluate them, Morales said. The remedy must also address crashes on all roads, including highways, the agency said.
 
Cummings, a former NHTSA special adviser who is set to be an expert witness for the plaintiff in an upcoming Florida lawsuit against Tesla, said she expects Tesla's warnings to deter a small number of drivers from abusing Autopilot. But the problems for Tesla, Cummings said, won't end until it limits where the system can be used and fixes its computer vision system so it better detects obstacles.

At present, it is difficult to evaluate the cartilage of an equine stifle with the most accessible imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and radiography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as the optimal noninvasive modality for a global evaluation of joints in humans. With technical advances, MRI is becoming more available for equine patients as well. Currently there is no general consensus on the optimal sequence for cartilage evaluation even though there are many possibilities. This study compares a routinely used two-dimensional (2D) sequence to four different three dimensional sequences (3D). Measuring the cartilage thickness in 30 different regions of interest (ROI) in each sequence and comparing them to macroscopic measurements showed that the 3D sequences were more accurate than the 2D sequence. Specifically, the 3D VIEW T2W HR and T1W VISTA SPAIR depicted cartilage thickness most accurately. Knowing the accuracy of different sequences improves the evaluation of equine cartilage and the early detection of cartilage pathologies. This promotes MRI as a noninvasive imaging modality for horses suffering from stifle lameness with no findings using conventional imaging methods. Furthermore, since 3D sequences are more accurate in depicting cartilage, they may replace 2D sequences, shortening scanning time.





 

The objective of this study was to compare articular cartilage thickness observed in the different 2D and 3D sequences to the cartilage thickness of the equine stifle in cadavers to determine the accuracy of each sequence. The study was conducted as a blinded laboratory study using seven equine stifle specimens. The 2D (T2W TSE) and 3D (3D VIEW T2W HR, T2 3D mFFE, T1W VISTA SPAIR, 3D PDW SPAIR) 3-tesla MRI sequences of each stifle were obtained. Cartilage thickness was measured at 30 locations on MRI and on gross pathology. Thickness measurements were compared using a Bland–Altman plot and post hoc analysis tests. The 3D sequences were found to be generally more accurate than the 2D sequence (
p
 < 0.001). The smallest difference to macroscopic measurements was observed in the 3D VIEW T2W HR and T1W VISTA SPAIR sequences with no statistical difference between each other. Knowing the accuracy of different sequences will improve the evaluation of equine cartilage and the early detection of cartilage pathologies. This would promote MRI as a noninvasive imaging modality for horses suffering from stifle lameness with no findings in conventional imaging methods. Furthermore, since 3D sequences seem to have better accuracy in depicting cartilage, they may replace 2D sequences, thereby shortening scanning times.

Tesla did a lot of growing up in 2023.
 
Elon Musk's company started the year 
back on its heels
, with overflowing inventory, a 
stale-looking lineup
, and shrinking profit margins due to a slew of hefty discounts.
 
All of these 
problems
 were shockingly mundane for a company helmed by one of the most polarizing figures in tech, and some saw it as a sign that Wall Street darling Tesla might just be 
a normal car company
 after all.
 
The normality at Tesla was 
welcomed and encouraged by investors
, who were frustrated by Musk's antics at his social media company X (formerly Twitter) and the knock-off effect on Tesla's value.
 
""The Cinderella ride is over for Tesla,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a January note to clients. ""Musk now needs to navigate the company through this Category 5 dark macro storm instead of focusing on his new golden child Twitter, which remains a distraction and overhang for the Tesla story/stock in our opinion.""
 
With 2023 largely in the rearview, automotive analysts who spoke with Business Insider agree that this year 
Tesla
 has taken a new place in Musk's empire, alongside X and 
SpaceX
, as a steady and reliable business.
 
Musk won his own price war
 
Investors were 
initially nervous
 at the start of the year when 
Tesla's series of price reductions
 ate into the company's industry-leading automotive margins — often touted as justification for Tesla's market value eclipsing rest of the automotive industry.
 
But later in the year when the EV market experienced 
a sudden shift in buyers
 – away from early adopters and toward more budget-minded shoppers – Musk came out on top. While Tesla got ready to roll out its long-awaited 
Cybertruck
, competitors like 
Ford
, 
GM
 and 
Mercedes-Benz
 
warned investors
 that their EV businesses were 
hitting roadblocks
.
 
""This is a pretty brutal space,"" CFO Harald Wilhelm said on an October analyst call. ""I can hardly imagine the current status quo is fully sustainable for everybody.""
 
While legacy car companies go back to the drawing board on their EV ambitions, Tesla has lots of runway to price their cars correctly for the market while still turning a profit on battery-powered cars – something almost none of Tesla's competitors have achieved as of yet.
 
Deutsche Bank predicts fourth-quarter revenue around $24.7 billion and an automotive gross margin around 16.2%, according to a recent note to clients. That margin is off 10 basis points from the third quarter alone, but still outpaces the industry average around 9%.
 
That shows just how much room Musk has to run on price cuts for the next several months, analysts say.
 
Cybertruck brings the hype
 
While Tesla spent most of this year doing normal car company things, like discounting cars and adjusting manufacturing efficiencies, the 
Cybertruck launch
 in November provided the shot in the arm Musk's company needed to keep people excited.
 
Production on the trapezoidal 
truck
 started over the summer, leading to months of hype and online speculation about Cybertruck's final form. While the launch event was a bit of a letdown for some of Tesla's biggest fans, Cybertruck is still a much-needed shot in the arm for an aging Tesla lineup.
 
A slew of new competition in the EV market this year meant that for the first time, 
Tesla started losing market share
 to competitors. The company's share of US EV sales fell to a record low of 50% in the third quarter, according to Cox Automotive, continuing a steady decline in share that began late last year.
 
Still, Tesla is expected to end 2023 with 1.8 million vehicles sold, according to Deutsche Bank. That's a nearly 38% increase from last year, and just barely hits the goal Musk set for the company at the start of the year.
 
Musk's personal drama
 
While Tesla began to act like an ordinary car company, Musk is far from a typical CEO and 2023 was perhaps one of his most tumultuous years yet.
 
Last month, Musk's issues at X finally started to spill over onto Tesla. When the billionaire 
appeared to boost
 an antisemitic post on X, the 
backlash
 from Tesla fans and investors was swift.
 
""Getting a flood of messages from clients wanting out of Tesla and anything to do with Elon Musk,"" Tesla investor Ross Gerber wrote on X in November. ""Many saying they are 
selling their cars
 as well. What is he doing to the Tesla brand??!!?!?""
 
Musk eventually apologized for the post, calling it ""foolish.""
 
Just a week later, at Dealbook's November conference, X once again upstaged Tesla. Musk had little to say at the event about the Cybertruck and instead took the opportunity to tell X 
advertisers
, including Disney CEO Bob Iger to 
""Go fuck yourself.""
 
The next day, 
Tesla's Cybertruck
 delivery event was met by 
disappointment from fans
 — many of whom had expected Musk to deliver on the vehicle's promised range and price. Instead, what should have been Tesla's victory lap turned once again to public criticism of Musk.
 
Nonetheless, Musk has a propensity for 
bouncing back
.
 
""We started the year asking 'OK, who is going to catch Tesla this year?,"" said Martin French, managing director at automotive consultancy Berylls. ""I was always one of the ones that said Tesla will be very difficult to catch, and if you look back at 2024, no one's come anywhere near close.""

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi unveiled its first vehicle on Thursday, aspiring to compete with established companies including Porsche and Tesla.
 
The model, a sedan called SU7, has a size similar to BMW's 5 Series. Xiaomi said the model outperforms Porsche's electric vehicle Taycan and Tesla's Model S in such aspects as acceleration from zero to 100 km per hour and mileage on one charge.
 
The SU7 is also seen in footage to navigate itself through Beijing's busy urban traffic and park itself at narrow parking lots.
 
Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi, said the company is expected to join the ranks of top-tier players in terms of autonomous driving in 2024.
 
The sedan is also expected to appeal to customers due to its shared operating system with Xiaomi's popular phones and other electronic devices.
 
Lei did not reveal the price of the model, which is available in two variants, on Thursday. He added that it will launch the model in several months to come.
 
Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said he is impressed by the model's performance, adding that pricing will determine whether the model will be a hit.
 
Xiaomi unveiled its plan to build vehicles in 2021. In an interview with CCTV earlier this month, Lei said the company has spent over 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) on the first model, with over 3,400 engineers involved.
 
Lei expects Xiaomi to grow into a top five automaker worldwide in 15 to 20 years, which means its annual sales will stand above at least 6 million vehicles. So far none of the world's top five car companies is Chinese.
 
Yet China has been the world's largest vehicle market since 2009 and the largest one for new energy vehicles since 2015.

 has done an equivalent favor for enthusiasts that its products do for  owners, which is to show detailed aspects of the Cybertruck that 's handover event and website have not. We're most interested in the two-part ""Dissecting a 
 Cybertruck
"" and the truly deep dive into driving mode pages, plus the bonus feature about the 
air compressor port behind the rear wheel arch
. The first ""Dissecting"" vid looks at the underbody from bumper to bumper, including what's in the wheel arches.  engineers built in some neat features like a pad for lift arms when 
working on the truck
, indentations that could be intended as support points for jack stands, and exposed bolt holes for side steps and rock sliders.
 
There are some interesting omissions as well, like increased protection for the 
battery
 pack and proper skid plating outside the battery pack. Of course, those are mainly applicable to owners who plan hardcore off-roading. Based on trends in the general market, the Cybertruck won't do much of that. However, for those few, T Sportsline also notes that the design of the front suspension means there's less than an inch of clearance between an upper knuckle bolt and the top of the stock 35-inch front tire, so 37s will be out of the question without some intense modifications.
 
The second ""Dissecting"" video
 moves up the 
truck
, pulling back the frunk liner to check out items like the auxiliary power feeds. There are two such feeds of 48 volts and up to 400 watts on the truck, one in the roof that will probably mainly serve light arrays, the other behind the frunk that could do lights, winches, and other accessories. These feeds are different than power outlets, which are grouped in three areas, two in the cabin and one in the bed.

the video about the off-road modes

The host flips through the numerous pages to explain permutations and combinations, takes the Cybertruck back to the shop to answer questions that arise from navigating the pages, then measures specs like tire clearance and ground clearance to see where one of the first delivery units stands in relation to the 
advertised
 capability. In some spots, it's even better, ground clearance measuring 17 inches as opposed to the 16 inches we've been told about.

 was reportedly a victim of a bloody attack by a robot at a factory near Austin, Texas.
Recent reports revealed that a 2021 injury report which claims the robot that was designed to move aluminum car parts, 
pinned the engineer
 against a surface and dug its metal claws into the his back and arm, according to witnesses who spoke to The Information in a story published last month. 
After another worker hit an emergency stop button, the engineer maneuvered his way out of the robot's grasp, falling a couple of feet down a chute designed to collect scrap aluminum and leaving a trail of blood behind him, one of the witnesses told The Information.
The attack reportedly occurred while the engineer was programming software for two disabled Tesla robots nearby.

In 2022, the Tesla Texas gigafactory was subject to a federal investigation for failing to pay workers holiday, overtime and other earned wages. 
Staff attorney Hannah Alexander of the Workers Defense Project told a local news outlet that the unpaid wages range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars.

Here are…","An investigative report by The Information recently revealed a series of workplace injuries at Tesla's Giga Texas factory, with a notable incident involving a robot attack on an engineer that occurred two years ago. This incident brought attention to the safety challenges and risks associated with the increasing integration of automation in manufacturing, shedding light on the potential hazards faced by workers in automated environments. Elon Musk has now commented on the same, saying that the information is inaccurate.
""Truly shameful of the media to dredge up an injury from two years ago due to a simple industrial Kuka robot arm (found in all factories) and imply that it is due to Optimus now,"" Elon Musk said on X. He was replying to Andrew McCarthy on X, who explained that the robot just made a decision and ""did exactly as it was programmed to do."" He also further asserted that the worker might have thought that the robot was off when it wasn't.
The specific incident unfolded when an engineer at Giga Texas unwittingly commenced work on three robots in 2021. Unfortunately, only two of the robots were powered down, and the third continued its operation, leading to a perilous situation. The engineer found themselves pinned against a surface by the robot's claws, resulting in injuries that caused bleeding from the victim's back and arm. Swift action, including the activation of an emergency stop button by a co-worker, allowed the engineer to escape the robot's grasp, albeit falling down a scrap-metal chute in the process.
Despite Tesla filing an injury report with the county in response to the incident, concerns arise over the frequency of safety inspections by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at Tesla's Austin factory. The report indicates that OSHA inspected the factory only once a year in 2021 and 2022, prompting questions about the adequacy of safety measures, especially given the factory's higher injury rates compared to other auto plants. According to The Information's analysis of federal data, nearly one in 21 workers at the Austin factory suffered on-the-job injuries last year, a rate significantly above the industry median of one in 30.
The safety disparities extend to Tesla's Fremont factory in California, which, despite exhibiting a high injury rate, underwent more frequent safety inspections. The one in 12 injury rate for Fremont workers in 2022 raises concerns about Tesla's overall workplace safety protocols.
The report also underscores the concerns voiced by the CDC's Center for Occupational Robotics Research, predicting a potential rise in fatalities due to the increasing use of industrial robots in the United States. The integration of collaborative robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles in work environments introduces new safety challenges.
As Tesla persists in its ambitious endeavor to manufacture an affordable electric car at Giga Texas, this incident highlights the critical need for enhanced safety measures and more frequent inspections to safeguard workers from the potential risks associated with automated manufacturing processes.",indiatoday.in,1817,business,IN,en,India Today Technology desk,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202312/elon-musk-14483233-16x9.jpg?VersionId=KA.jNyZj8IJEQLYYw8C8vtoLaFItyXSJ,False,@indiatoday,7.3135967,cafa63d9de724a422598b209e7b03eaf

746,An abused wife took on Tesla over tracking tech. She lost,Reuters,2023-12-24 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/12/24/an-abused-wife-took-on-tesla-over-tracking-tech-she-lost/,autoblog.com,Cases of technology-enabled stalking involving cars are emerging as automakers add sophisticated features such as location tracking. Here's such a case.,"San Francisco police Sergeant David Radford contacted 
Tesla
 in May 2020 with a request on a case: Could the automaker provide data on an alleged stalker's remote access to a vehicle? 
 
A woman had come into the station visibly shaken, according to a police report. She told police that her abusive husband, in violation of a restraining order, was stalking and harassing her using the technology in their 
2016 Tesla Model X
. 
 
The SUV allows owners to remotely access its location and control other features through a smartphone app. She told police she had discovered a metal baseball bat in the back seat — the same bat the husband had previously used to threaten her, the police report stated. 
 
Weeks later, Sergeant Radford asked Tesla for data that might help the investigation. A Tesla service manager replied that remote-access logs were only available within seven days of the events recorded, according to records in a lawsuit the woman later filed. Radford's investigation stalled. 
 
Cases of technology-enabled stalking involving cars are emerging as automakers add ever-more-sophisticated features, such as location tracking and remote control of functions such as locking doors or honking the horn, according to interviews with divorce lawyers, private investigators and anti-domestic-violence advocates. Such abusive behavior using other devices, such as phone spyware or tracking devices, has long been a concern, prompting technology companies including Google and Apple to design safeguards into their products. 
 
Reuters examined the details of the San Francisco case and another one involving alleged stalking through Tesla technology but could not quantify the scope of such abuse. Tesla has encountered at least one other case of stalking through its vehicle app, according to a Tesla employee's testimony in the San Francisco woman's lawsuit. Some attorneys, private investigators and anti-abuse advocates said in interviews that they knew of similar cases but declined to provide details, citing privacy and security concerns. 
 
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Radford and the San Francisco Police Department did not comment on the investigation. 
 
The San Francisco case offers insight into the complex considerations these technologies pose for auto companies and law enforcement. Other automakers offer similar tracking and remote-access features, and an industry group has acknowledged the need for protections to ensure 
car technology
 doesn't become a tool for abuse. 
 
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a technology-focused trade group for automakers and suppliers, in 2021 cited spousal violence as a reason why California regulators should not require carmakers to release location or other personal data in most cases under a new state privacy law. The law sought to give consumers broadly the right to access their personal data being tracked by companies. The auto group argued some car owners might improperly request personal data on other drivers of the same vehicle. 
 
Disclosing location-tracking data to an abuser could create 'the potential for significant harm,' wrote the AAI. The group's membership includes many major automakers, but not Tesla. 
 
Some automakers have taken steps to prevent the misuse of data their vehicles track. 
General Motors
 spokesperson Kelly Cusinato said 
GM
's 
OnStar
 mobile system allows all drivers to mask their location, even if they are not the vehicle's owner or primary user. 
Rivian
, which makes 
electric trucks
 and SUVs, is working on a similar function, said Wassym Bensaid, senior vice president of software development. 
 
Rivian hasn't encountered a case of domestic abuse through its vehicle technology, according to Bensaid, but believes 'users should have a right to control where that information goes.' 
 
GM declined to comment on whether its technology had been involved in any alleged domestic abuse. 
 
Request denied
 
The San Francisco woman sued her husband in state Superior Court in 2020 on claims including assault and sexual 
battery
. She later named Tesla as a defendant, accusing the automaker of negligence for continuing to provide the husband access to the car despite the restraining order against him. Her lawsuit sought monetary damages from Tesla. 
 
The woman, at her request, is identified in court papers only by her initials; she cited a risk of physical harm. Her husband is also identified only by his initials. 
 
Reuters reviewed court filings, police reports, depositions, company emails and other documents in the case, which has not been previously reported. 
 
The woman made multiple requests to Tesla in writing and in person, according to her lawsuit, seeking remote data logs and asking Tesla to disable her husband's account. The requests started in 2018, more than a year before Radford, the police investigator, sought data from Tesla. 
 
Tesla told the woman that it could not remove her husband's access to the car's technology because his name remained on the vehicle's title as a co-owner, along with hers, according to records she filed in her lawsuit. 
 
Tesla prevailed in the lawsuit. After denying the San Francisco police request for evidence, the automaker argued she had no proof that her husband 
used the car
's features to stalk her. Tesla also argued the restraining order against the woman's husband never specifically ordered the automaker to act. 
 
The woman and her husband settled the lawsuit in 2023 on undisclosed terms. Their divorce case is pending. The restraining order against the husband remains in effect. 
 
The husband, in a deposition, denied tracking or harassing his wife through the vehicle's technology. His attorney declined to comment. 
 
In a separate case, Renée Izambard said in an interview that her then-husband was tracking her on his Tesla app after he made comments to her indicating he knew where she had been. Izambard filed for divorce from her husband in 2018 and alleged years of physical and psychological abuse.
 
Izambard said in an interview her ex-husband's tracking of her through the vehicle was 'just one part of a much wider pattern of coercive control.' 
 
Her ex-husband and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. 
 
Unlike the San Francisco woman, Izambard had her own access to change the account settings and turn off its connection to the internet, so she did not have to interact with Tesla, she said. Tesla cars allow a primary account holder to add additional drivers who can access the car's features and settings – or the primary user can deny other drivers that access, according to the San Francisco woman's lawsuit. She complained in court records that the company only allowed one primary account holder even in cases like hers, where two people co-owned the vehicle. 
 
No policy
 
Long before the latest automotive features enabled stalking, abusers used other technology on smartphones or tracking devices, said Jeff Kaplan, a private investigator. 
 
Apple launched its AirTag location-tracking device in 2021 as a way to help people find lost purses or keys. The small tags can easily be concealed in a car's interior or other locations, and soon became a favorite tool for one partner to track another. 'I'm getting those all the time,' Kaplan said. 
 
Earlier this year, Apple and Google jointly proposed standardized technology that could be adopted by any tech company that would allow for alerting people who are being tracked without their knowledge through tags or smartphone features. The idea, presented to a tech-industry standards organization, won praise from some anti-domestic abuse advocates. Apple and Google did not comment for this story. 
 
In the San Francisco case, Tesla said in response to a plaintiff's written request for information that it 'does not have a specific companywide policy' regarding how to handle stalking allegations involving its vehicles' technology. 
 
Stalkers always find a way to use location data, making this problem 'totally foreseeable,' said Catherine Crump, a Berkeley Law School professor specializing in privacy issues involving technology. 
 
'It is disappointing that a company as sophisticated and well-resourced as Tesla doesn't have better answers to this,' said Crump, who is also a former adviser to the White House Domestic Policy Council. 
 
 
 
 
Bat in the car
 
When the San Francisco woman and her husband bought the 
Tesla Model X
 in January 2016, he set himself up as the administrator on the account and listed her as an additional driver, her lawsuit said. That meant she could not remove his access without his password. 
 
After they separated in August 2018, a family law judge found she had suffered repeated physical abuse during the marriage, which the husband acknowledged, as well as sexual abuse, which he denied, court records show. The judge found her version of events credible and his 'less credible.' 
 
Over the next several months, the woman alleged, she regularly returned to the car to find that its settings and features appeared to have been manipulated. She found the doors open, the suspension settings changed, and the vehicle's ability to charge turned off. When she asked service center employees for help, they tried to disconnect the car from the Internet, but those attempts failed, she said in court records. 
 
Two letters, one of them dated in 2018, to Tesla's legal department by anti-domestic abuse advocates on the woman's behalf asked the company to preserve data logs and remove the husband's access. Tesla told the court it could not find these letters in its files. 
 
Eventually, a Tesla service center manager contacted Tesla deputy general counsel Ryan McCarthy for advice, the manager said in a deposition reviewed by Reuters. McCarthy said the woman needed to have her husband removed from the vehicle's title in order for the company to disable his account, the service manager testified. 
 
McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment. 
 
In its successful defense against the woman's lawsuit, Tesla cited the husband's denials and said she had 'no proof other than her 'belief and imagination' that her husband used the car's technology to stalk her. 
 
San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow agreed with Tesla, writing in a 2022 opinion that both the woman and her husband 'had a right' to use the car technology. It is unclear how Tesla was supposed to determine whether her allegations were legitimate, he wrote. 
 
'A jilted partner might fabricate misuse charges to punish the other,' Karnow wrote, adding that the consequences of imposing liability for car manufacturers 'would be broad and incalculable.'

The price war and slowing EV demand, however, have prompted automakers including Ford Motor to pull back on their electrification plans, leaving Tesla as the undisputed leader in the United States and helping its stock more than double this year.
""The fourth quarter is typically the strongest of the year in terms of deliveries for Tesla, we're expecting that to be the case again this year,"" said Garrett Nelson, senior analyst at CFRA Research.
Tesla likely delivered 1.82 million vehicles globally in 2023, up 37 per cent from 2022, with about 473,000 units in the fourth quarter, according to 14 analysts polled by LSEG.
In January, Musk said that Tesla has the potential to achieve 2 million deliveries this year, if there was no 'fr**king force majeure'. But as recently as October, he warned that higher borrowing costs were pressuring demand.
The company, which made a year-end sales push by increasing discounts on its key models, has said it aims to achieve a 50 per cent average annual growth rate over multiple years.
Going into 2024, the EV market leader will have to contend with the loss of federal tax credits for some of its cars in the United States as well as in Germany, where the government is prematurely ending its EV subsidy program.
This may force more price cuts next year even though interest rates and battery ingredient costs are expected to ease.
Jairam Nathan, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, trimmed his estimate for Tesla's deliveries next year to 2.04 million from 2.14 million and said he was modeling for a 4 per cent decline in average revenue per car from 2023.
The company is also dealing with a rise in regulatory scrutiny of its self-driving systems and other parts in the United States and in some European countries. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled nearly all of its 2 million vehicles on United States roads to install new safeguards.
Musk has previously said he believes full self-driving (FSD) could one day account for most of Tesla's value.
Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect 2.2 million deliveries by Tesla next year. Most believe that the newly-released Cybertruck and a refreshed Model 3 are not enough to boost demand.
""Tesla candidly admitted the company is now in an intermediate low-growth period,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note, citing a meeting with Investor Relations Chief Martin Viecha.
Investors expect Tesla's margins to remain pressured as the company ramps up Cybertruck production and prepares to launch a cheaper car platform.
Musk has said Cybertrucks will be a small percentage of the vehicles Tesla makes next year and that there are ""enormous challenges"" in reaching volume production for the pickup, whose controversial design has divided fans.
Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a report that Cybertruck would represent 3 per cent of Tesla's volumes in 2024, calling it more of a 'halo' product that could attract consumers to the brand.

748,Hackers say the Tesla nightmare in Netflix's 'Leave the World Behind' could really happen,Stephen Council,2023-12-27 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2023/12/27/hackers-say-the-tesla-nightmare-in-netflix039s-039leave-the-world-behind039-could-really-happen,thestar.com.my,"Netflix's hit streaming movie Leave the World Behind has its share of outlandish, apocalyptic mayhem. But it turns out that one of the movie's most bizarre scenes might actually be possible.","Netflix's hit streaming movie Leave the World Behind has its share of outlandish, apocalyptic mayhem. But it turns out that one of the movie's most bizarre scenes might actually be possible.

The chart-topping film centres around the Sandford and Scott families, who find themselves sharing a country house outside of New York City. As surreal events befall the group (and society at large), a sense of paranoid distrust steadily grows. Around the one-hour mark, just after ""Death to America"" pamphlets rain from the sky, the Sandfords decide they'll take their chances with fleeing their vacation home via the expressway to New Jersey.

But they find both lanes blocked - with dozens of smashed-up white Tesla Model 3s. Amanda Sandford, played by Julia Roberts, climbs out of the family Jeep and slowly walks into the mess of banged-up cars and broken glass.

As another vehicle approaches from behind, Amanda notices that the sales sticker on one of the cars includes a dubious but familiar Tesla sales point: ""Full Self-Driving Safety Features,"" it says, ""Navigate on Autopilot: automatic driving.""

Amanda realises that the oncoming car is going to crash into her Jeep, then books it back to her vehicle, imploring her husband to dive in. She spins the car away and barely avoids the oncoming Tesla, which crashes violently into the wrecked cars she'd just been examining. Six more brand-new Teslas follow, all empty, all speeding, all barely avoided by a swerving Sandford family - and each one crashes mightily into the two-lane jam of wrecked cars.

It's a high-intensity, startling scene, even in the thriller context. It also feels plausible, perhaps especially to San Franciscans who've seen Waymo and Cruise vehicles zipping around the city without drivers for the past few years. But could this actually happen, with Teslas? Hacking experts told SFGATE it'd be incredibly difficult to pull off - but never impossible.

Renaud Feil and David Berard work for the French cybersecurity company Synacktiv; they won US$350,000 (RM1.6mil) at a March conference co-sponsored by Tesla, by showing off ways to hack into a Tesla's entertainment center and its energy management system.

Asked about the Leave the World Behind scene over email, Feil and Berard said, ""It's a difficult hack to perform, but it can't be ruled out as impossible."" They added that a ""rogue Tesla employee"" might have the best chance at pulling it off, ""and if an employee can do it, a hacker who gained access to the credentials of a Tesla employee could do it as well. No system is fully secured.""

Tesla's over-the-air updates, they said, are a ""two-sided coin."" On one hand, they let the Tesla team send regular security patches and erase vulnerabilities before hackers notice them. Plus, the company's security progress has been impressive in recent years, they said. However, the constant software connection makes cars vulnerable to a well-constructed, large-scale attack - hackers or rogue employees could remove safety features en masse.

David Colombo, who found a way to remotely control features on 25 Teslas around the world in 2022, agreed that the over-the-air updates are a potential weakness for Tesla security. If someone somehow injected malicious firmware in one of the updates, he said, it could spread quietly across the fleet - much like the SolarWinds hack in 2020.

The more salient Tesla-specific feature might be ""Smart Summon,"" which lets owners order an empty car to pick them up in a parking lot or private area. Because high-end Tesla models already have the tech to drive without a passenger, it'd require fewer exploits to turn a fleet into a rampaging horde. Still, it'd be extremely difficult. X user @greentheonly, who has posted about Tesla design and security for years, told SFGATE over email that a hacker would need control of Tesla's servers, over-the-air updates and more - and ""the more steps you need, the less likely is the combination for an external attacker.""

It turns out, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made remarks that prefigure Leave the World Behind. He likened a Tesla car to a ""laptop on wheels"" onstage at a 2017 meeting of the National Governors Association, and said Tesla has engineered its cars' powertrains and braking systems to have their own separate security encryptions.

""I think one of the biggest risks for autonomous vehicles is somebody achieving a fleet-wide hack,"" he said. ""In principle, if somebody was able to hack, say, all of the autonomous Teslas, they could say, I mean just as a prank, they could say, 'Send 'em all to Rhode Island.'

""That would be the end of Tesla,"" he joked. – SFGate, San Francisco/Tribune News Service",thestar.com.my,1823,news,MY,en,Stephen Council,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2023/12/26/2458108.jpg,False,,7.073657,f9de5db88030495f1ee39547c89aef07

A thorough Model Y exterior facelift is in store very soon with upgraded specs, too, scheduled for a 2024 summer release.

4 Reviews

Tesla is preparing to do to the 2024 Model Y what it did to the Model 3 Highland, a facelift and interior redesign and sources from its Gigafactory in Shanghai have confirmed that it is being retooled to release it next summer.

The mid-2024 Tesla Model Y release has a codename internally, rumored to be Project Juniper, just like the Model 3 Highland. The Highland refresh includes sleeker forms and slightly longer body, as well as restyled head- and taillights, upgraded interior and specs, plus new badging.

2024 Model Y Juniper design and specs

The Model Y already got the LED ambient lighting that the Model 3 Highland introduced, so the 2024 Juniper refresh should include an additional overhaul of the interior. The Model Y, which globally is Tesla's bestselling vehicle, should get a bigger and bolder redesign to fight off Tesla's biggest competitor BYD that already refreshed its bestsellers in China, as well as its other formidable competitors there.

BYD may surpass Tesla this quarter and become the world's largest EV maker, according to some analysts, and Tesla is reacting accordingly by upgrading its largest Gigafactory in Shanghai to prep it for the 2024 Model Y production.

Tesla was initially scheduled to announce Juniper next fall, but it has apparently pulled the launch forward to battle the onslaught of direct competitors like the cheaper Sea Lion that BYD recently unveiled. It is also reportedly going to equip it with a new, possibly larger M3P battery by CATL, of the type it used in the Model 3 Highland refresh.

According to factory sources, Tesla will idle its Chinese plant for a week around the New Year's festivities in order to upgrade its newer manufacturing facilities there. It will perform additional retooling, as needed, to prepare for the mass Model Y Juniper production with a release date scheduled for the middle of 2024, about two quarters from now.",notebookcheck.net,5474,business,AT,en,Daniel Zlatev,https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc4/2024-model-y-lamian-design.jpg,False,,6.5203404,590d1f0bda7686d1c78836dd76ba5b82
