0,Zotac Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo Review,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,2023-01-04 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/zotac-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-amp-extreme-airo,pcmag.com,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti has strong performance, and it could be a great graphics card...but only if the price is right.","Nvidia's newest graphics card, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, does nothing to buck the recent trends of exponential performance gains paired with parallel rocketing prices. But, thanks to competition, this high-end card's price isn't quite as high as it was once slated to be. To evaluate the level of performance you should expect from the RTX 4070 Ti, we tested out Zotac's Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo, which is one of the higher-end partner-made models of the RTX 4070 Ti. (There is no Founders Edition of the RTX 4070 Ti.) Now, there's no question that the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is a powerful piece of gaming hardware. However, it's a card you'll only want to buy if you see it at the right price. With Nvidia setting the base price for RTX 4070 Ti cards at $799.99, even the lowest expected price may be too high for most gamers.

Design: I Was Once an RTX 4080

If you've been following along with Nvidia's rollout of the RTX 40-series graphics cards so far, you'll likely know that Nvidia initially announced two versions of the RTX 4080. These were the RTX 4080 16GB, and the RTX 4080 12GB. Ultimately Nvidia opted to change this arrangement, with the RTX 4080 16GB becoming the vanilla GeForce RTX 4080 that we reviewed in November. The RTX 4080 12GB, for its part, has been rebranded as the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, which we are reviewing here.

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Ti has a lot in common with the RTX 4080, just as you might expect from their original names. Both cards are built on the AD103 graphics chip that is based on the Ada Lovelace architecture and built using a customized 4nm TSMC manufacturing process. At first, this might give the impression that the two cards will perform similarly, but the AD103 chips used on RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards have been considerably cut down, leading to a noticeable performance rift.

Out of the 76 SMs available on an RTX 4080, the RTX 4070 Ti has access to only 60. This dramatically drops core counts from 9,728 CUDA cores, 304 TMUs, 112 ROPs, and 76 Ray Tracing (RT) cores on the RTX 4080 to just 7,680 CUDA cores, 240 TMUs, 80 ROPs, and 60 RT cores. Essentially a straight 26% drop in all hardware resources, which is matched by the change in VRAM capacity from 16GB of the RTX 4080 to just 12GB on the RTX 4070 Ti.

Nvidia increased the clock speed on the RTX 4070 Ti slightly to make up for its reduced resource count, but the 2,310MHz base clock and 2,610MHz boost clock on the reference RTX 4070 Ti do little to make up for the losses. This is especially true in the bandwidth department, as the RTX 4070 Ti also has just a 192-bit memory interface and slower VRAM, giving it only about 70% of the bandwidth that the RTX 4080 enjoys. This is notably less bandwidth than its direct predecessor, the Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti, had as well, as that card shipped with 608GBps of bandwidth.

Long story short, the changes made to the card lead to a significant drop in performance. Some of this was expected as it wouldn't make sense for Nvidia to make two graphics cards that perform identically at very different prices, but we can't help but feel Nvidia might have taken the cutbacks a bit too far with the RTX 4070 Ti.

A Closer Look at the RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo

Nvidia didn't create Founders Edition models of the RTX 4070 Ti, so we tested a Zotac Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo card instead to gauge the performance of the RTX 4070 Ti family as a whole. This card is rather enormous and, though it gives the impression of being smaller than Nvidia's RTX 40-series Founders Edition cards due to its rounded design, it's actually considerably larger.

The downside to this is that the card isn't going to fit well inside many cases, but it does have phenomenal cooling performance. That heatsink is simply huge, and the trio of fans installed over it resulted in far lower-than-expected operating temperatures during our thermal tests, which we will cover below. The card also has a decent factory overclock pushing the boost clock up to 2,700MHz.

Zotac opted to fit this card out with a new 12VHPWR power connector instead of old-fashioned PCI Express (PCIe) power connectors. This fits with Nvidia's other RTX 40-series cards that have shipped so far, and the card includes an adapter for 12VHPWR to three eight-pin PCIe connectors for users that don't yet have a power supply with 12VHPWR—which is almost everyone at the time of writing.

The rear I/O panel on the card is also equipped with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port, which has become the go-to standard for most graphics cards these days.

Price Cuts Already, But Is It Still Too High?

One of the more controversial and difficult aspects of the new RTX 4070 Ti to discuss is its price. Prior to the card's public unveiling, several different prices were bandied about for the RTX 4070 Ti (and the RTX 4080 12GB, back when that used to be its name) before Nvidia finally landed on an MSRP of $799.99. At the time of writing, we're still lacking a lot of information about pricing when it comes to the RTX 4070 Ti, and we don't even know how much the Zotac Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo will retail for.

What we do know, however, is that even with the $799.99 starting price, we are going to see RTX 4070 Ti cards at several price points at launch. Some of the Asus RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards will retail for as much as $999.99 and $1,049.99, and other Asus cards that will retail for as little as $799.99 or $849.99.

The higher prices here are simply untenable. No one for any reason should spend $999.99 or $1,049.99 on an RTX 4070 Ti. We can say this without question, as AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX retails for $999.99 and it is often faster than the RTX 4080. As you'll see when we get to the benchmarks, that performance gap has only gotten a lot bigger when comparing the RTX 4070 Ti to the RX 7900 XTX. There's just no point in buying the RTX 4070 Ti at that price when you can get a faster card for the same price or less.

The same can also be said for RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards retailing for $899.99 or more, as the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT retails at that price and it is also faster than the RTX 4070 Ti, though by only a small margin. This leaves the only RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards worth considering to be those that retail for less than $899.99, and even then it's not an open and shut case.

At $849.99, we'd say the RTX 4070 Ti is competitive with AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT. At $799.99, it can be argued that the RTX 4070 Ti is a better value than the RX 7900 XT. However, the price will be perhaps more critical than most times making this decision.

Unfortunately for Zotac and the card we are testing today, it's likely to be one of the more expensive models, and if so we really can't recommend it heartily unless it sells for under $899.99. We also can't help but once again regret the trend of higher prices we are seeing this generation, as the RTX 3070 Ti originally cost just $599, making it far more affordable at launch than the RTX 4070 Ti.

Test Setup

The Zotac Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo graphics card was tested on our 2022 GPU test bed with an Intel Core i9-12900K processor that is cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X(Opens in a new window) water cooler. The system also includes an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard, 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM(Opens in a new window) clocked at 5,600MHz, a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro(Opens in a new window) NVMe 4.0 SSD, and a Corsair HX1500i(Opens in a new window) 1,500W 80 Plus Platinum power supply. All tests were performed inside Windows 11 Pro with all of the latest updates installed.

The RTX 4070 Ti's main competitor at this time is the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT. All last-gen cards from both companies remain too slow to really make for strong competition. Though the last-gen cards aren't so slow that we'd recommend you upgrade if you have something like an AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080—those older cards are getting to where they aren't worth considering without sizable price cuts.

Synthetic Benchmarks

Nvidia's new RTX 40-series graphics cards have been turning in better synthetic test results in general than AMD's new Radeon RX 7000-series cards, and that's true with the RTX 4070 Ti as well.

In Unigine's Superposition test, we do see the RTX 4070 Ti fall behind the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, but not by a huge margin.

Ray Tracing, FSR and DLSS Testing

Ray tracing is another area in which Nvidia's new RTX 40-series cards tend to have the upper hand against the AMD competition. This advantage allows the RTX 4070 Ti to outpace the Radeon RX 7900 XT and nearly catch the Radeon RX 7900 XTX in F1 22. In Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the RTX 4070 Ti far outperforms both of these AMD cards.

FSR isn't working correctly in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy with AMD Radeon RX 7000-series cards, so we aren't able to run that test on either card. In F1 22 with FSR and DLSS enabled, however, we see the situation improve for AMD with both the RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX now surpassing the RTX 4070 Ti.

AAA Game Tests

In games that don't support Ray Tracing, the RTX 4070 Ti loses its greatest advantage and falls behind the Radeon RX 7900 XT in almost all of our AAA game tests. It does manage a small lead at 1080p in Far Cry 5, but so small as to be inside the margin of error for testing. This is further minimized by clear signs of a bottleneck occurring in this test on several cards, which is due either to the game engine or the Core i9 processor.

Most notable are the 4K test results in these games that all show a fairly significant performance lead for the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT. This ranges from a 4% advantage for the RX 7900 XT in Shadow of the Tomb Raider up to a 17% advantage in Far Cry 5. However, more often than not, the RTX 4070 Ti is within 10% of the RX 7900 XT's test score.

With a $799.99 price for the RTX 4070 Ti and $899.99 for the RX 7900 XT, this makes both cards highly competitive. The RTX 4070 Ti is arguably a slightly better value when you consider performance-per-dollar and ray tracing—but without ray tracing, the RX 7900 XT comes off as slightly better.

Legacy Game Tests

Legacy game tests are often limited due to compatibility and the performance of the game engine used by these older games. As a result, performance lands all over the place, which is why the older RTX 30-series graphics cards dominate these charts even though they are, in fact, slower than their RTX 40-series counterparts.

These tests are most important to see if the cards can run these games at all and do so with playable frame rates, even if they can't beat out the last-gen. Overall, the RTX 4070 Ti doesn't do too badly in these tests, but it does fail to maintain 60 frames per second in Hitman Absolution at 4K. It also doesn't run quite as well as the AMD competition in these tests overall, but it grabs a win in Sleeping Dogs at 4K.

Power and Thermal Tests

We test the power consumption of the entire system using a Kill-A-Watt meter. The graphics card is the only part changed during these tests, which points to it as the lead cause for the differences in power consumption observed during the tests.

Among the new cards we've tested, the RTX 4070 Ti is one of the most efficient. Its idle power is slightly higher, though this could have been caused by the CPU not idling down quite all the way. The power consumption in FurMark and Guardians of the Galaxy is much more indicative of how much power the card is pulling, and there's no question that in these tests it uses less power than the RTX 4080 and the RX 7900 XT.

Zotac's Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo also remains quite cool during the FurMark test, hitting just 49 degrees C. We ran a separate thermal test during the F1 22 2K test that shows the card can hit a peak temperature of 67 degrees C, which is exceptional.

Conclusion

Rating Zotac's Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti as a family is difficult for us to do at the time of writing, as we don't have complete pricing information at this time. The best we can say at this time is to carefully watch prices, especially as more RTX 4070 Ti cards launch. As we mentioned earlier, priced below $899.99, the RTX 4070 Ti is definitely competitive with AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT, and at $799.99 it's arguably a better buy. If you find it priced above that, then you should consider other options instead.

Following this to the letter, we'd consider Zotac's Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo a less-than-attractive option over $899.99, but a decent one if it retails for less than that. We also can't help but acknowledge the generational price increase yet again, as a lower price could make the RTX 4070 Ti an outstanding graphics card—if it was priced at, say, $699.99 instead. But as it exists, priced at $200 over its predecessor and at best $100 apart from its closest competitor (which is also slightly faster) makes the RTX 4070 Ti Amp Extreme Airo a difficult card to place.",pcmag.com,492,news,US,en,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06cXbs6eOASPDqmbce0Ecbm-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1672788191.jpg,False,@pcmag,8.474894,41fddfebc84200b8678641082b110311,0.0,0.0,0.9999347925186157,1.0,0.0,0.0

This would put it $100 cheaper than what was going to be the launch price of the RTX 4080 12 GB. NVIDIA cancelled the launch of the RTX 4080 12 GB, and reportedly re-branded it to the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4080 12 GB was supposed to launch alongside the RTX 4080 16 GB in mid-November 2022, but the company decided to ""unlaunch"" it, in the wake of bad press on the confusing and deceptive naming of the SKU, and its ambitious MSRP that would have put custom-design cards well above the $1,000-mark. The NVIDIA slide goes on to claim that the RTX 4070 Ti will be faster than the previous-generation flagship, the RTX 3090 Ti. This is thanks to its 40 shader TFLOP/s, 93 RT TFLOP/s, and 642 Tensor TFLOP/s. The RTX 4070 Ti is expected to debut the new 4 nm ""AD104"" silicon, featuring 7,680 CUDA cores, 60 RT cores, 240 Tensor cores, 240 TMUs, and 80 ROPs. The card features 12 GB of 21 Gbps GDDR6X memory across a rather narrow 192-bit memory bus. The slide confirms that January 5, 2023 will be the market availability date for the RTX 4070 Ti. NVIDIA's decision to price the RTX 4070 Ti at $799 may have been influenced by the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT priced at $899.

The GeForce RTX 4070, RTX 4060 and RTX 4050 will supposedly deliver GeForce RTX 3080-class performance while consuming a third of the power. Gaming laptops featuring the GPUs will be available starting February 22 at US$999. Gaming Geforce GPU Laptop Launch


While the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards will be featured in most spec sheets and top all performance charts, Nvidia's real bread and butter will lie in its lower-end siblings, namely the GeForce RTX 4070, GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4050. Nvidia claims the three mid-range GPUs can perform on par with the last-gen GeForce RTX 3080 mobile while consuming a third of the power. 
Starting with the GeForce RTX 4070 mobile, one gets 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM on a 128-bit bus, 4,608 CUDA cores, a boost clock of up to 2.1 GHz, and a TGP of up to 115 Watts. Nvidia hasn't mentioned its GPU, but a previous leak said it would pack an AD106 chip. 
Next up, the GeForce RTX 4060 sports identical VRAM and TGP specs as the GeForce RTX 4070, but lowers the CUDA core count to 3,072, presumably due to it using an AD107 GPU. This allows the boost clocked to be upped to 2.3 GHz.
 That leaves us with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050. While it increases the amount of VRAM to 6 GB GDDR6 (vs the RTX 3050), it is on a 96-bit bus, greatly hindering the total memory bandwidth. Other specs include a TGP of up to 115 Watts, 2,056 CUDA cores, and likely an AD107 GPU. 
The GeForce RTX 4070, RTX 4060 and RTX 4050 laptop versions all come with Ada Lovelace-exclusive features such as DLSS 3.0, NVENC dual AV1 encoders and Nvidia RTX Remix. Laptops running the graphics cards will be purchasable on February 22 starting at US$999. Some of the OEMs include Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung.

According to ASUS, this year's ROG Flow X13 also contains the following I/O:1x 3.5 mm combo jack 1x HDMI 2.1b1x Micro SD Card Reader (SD 4.0)1x ROG XG Mobile interface2x Speakers with Smart Amp Technology 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C with DisplayPort 1.4 and Power Delivery1x USB 4.0 Type-C with DisplayPort 1.4 and Power DeliveryAdditionally, the ROG Flow X13 (2023) has a 75 Wh battery, which sits within a 299 x 212 x 16.7 mm chassis. Overall, this year's ROG Flow X13 weighs 1.4 kg, regardless of the configuration chosen. ASUS adds that the machine will be configurable with up to 32 GB of LPDDR5-6400 RAM and a 2 TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, as well as a 13.4-inch display that operates at 2.5K with a 165 Hz refresh rate and 3 ms response times. Alternatively, the ROG Flow X13 (2023) will ship with an FHD panel that outputs at 120 Hz with 7 ms response times and 100% sRGB colour space coverage.It is worth noting that the ROG Flow X13 (2023) only has one SO-DIMM slot, with half of its RAM soldered to its motherboard. Currently, ASUS has not confirmed how much the ROG Flow X13 (2023) costs, nor has it provided a complete list of regions in which it will be available. The new ROG Flow X13 will be coming to Europe later this quarter, though. Purchase the ASUS TUF Dash 15 (2022) on Amazon

ASUS has refreshed the ROG Flow Z13, which now goes by the name ROG Flow Z13 (2023). According to the company, the ROG Flow Z13 (2023) will be available with the Core i9-13900H, a 45 W part from Intel's Raptor Lake series. For reference, the Core i9-13900H contains 14 cores, 20 threads and can boost its 6 P cores to 5.4 GHz when needed. By contrast, the processor's 8 E cores can reach 4.1 GHz.While the Core i9-13900H has an iGPU, the ROG Flow Z13 (2023) will rely on the RTX 4060 in GPU-heavy tasks, such as gaming and video editing. Based on the AD107 GPU, the RTX 4060 has 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 3,072 unified pipelines. At launch, the RTX 4060 will come with 35 W - 115 W TGPs. However, the RTX 4060 in the ROG Flow Z13 will peak at 65 W with Dynamic Boost. Additionally, the new ROG Flow Z13 will ship with up to 16 GB of DDR5-5200 RAM and up to 1 TB of PCIe 4.0 storage.Moreover, ASUS has included a 56 Wh battery, an ROG XG Mobile interface for connecting an external GPU and Thunderbolt 4, among other ports. Unlike the Surface Pro 9, the ROG Flow Z13 (2023) also features a 3.5 mm jack and a USB 3.0 Type-A port. All configurations contain the same 13.4-inch ROG Nebula display too, which operates at 2.5K (2,560 x 1,600) with a 165 Hz refresh rate and 7 ms response times. Unfortunately, ASUS has not confirmed when the new ROG Flow Z13 will be available, nor for how much or in which markets. Instead, the company has only outlined that the ROG Flow Z13 (2023) will be available at some point later this year.Purchase the ASUS TUF Dash 15 (2022) on Amazon

ASUS has presented a 2023 version of the ROG Zephyrus G14, its compact gaming laptop. As its name suggests, the ROG Zephyrus G14 still comes with a 14-inch display. According to ASUS' press release, this year's ROG Zephyrus G14 will be available with a choice of three panels:ROG Nebula HDR QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600)Mini LED backlights165 Hz refresh rate, 3 ms response times, 100% DCI-P3 colour space coverageNVIDIA G-SYNC, Dolby Vision, Pantone validatedROG Nebula Display QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600)IPS-level panel165 Hz refresh rate, 3 ms response times, 100% DCI-P3 colour space coverageNVIDIA G-SYNC, Dolby Vision, Pantone validatedFHD+ (1,290 x 1,200)IPS-level panel144 Hz refresh rate, 3 ms response times, 100% sRGB colour space coverageDolby Vision, Pantone validatedAdditionally, ASUS has equipped this year's ROG Zephyrus G14 with up to 32 GB of DDR5-4800 RAM split evenly between onboard memory and one upgradeable SO-DIMM slot.

Prices start at US$1,699 and HP will announce its availability later. Gaming Geforce Laptop Launch Raptor Lake


HP has also refreshed its gaming laptops with new hardware from Intel and Nvidia. Our in-depth review of last year's model (HP Omen 17 2022) deemed the laptop quite bland, and it'll be interesting to see if HP remedies it this time. Perhaps its optical mechanical keyboard will be sufficient to set it apart from the competition with its US$1,699 starting price. 
Unlike many high-end offerings from MSI and Acer that offer a 16:10 screen, the HP Omen 17 sticks with a tried and tested 17.3-inch 16:9 panel with the following resolutions and framerates- QHD (2,560 x 1,440) 240 Hz, QHD 165 Hz and FHD (1,920 x 1,080) 144 Hz. Both QHD variants have a response time of 3 ms, while the FHD model is slower at 7 ms. Peak brightness tops out at 300 nits for each variant. 
For the processor, the HP Omen 17 users can pick an Intel Core i9-13900HX or Core i7-13700HX. HP hasn't specified the models of graphics cards, but one can expect to spec the machine out with at least a GeForce RTX 4080, if not an RTX 4090. A leaked store listing from earlier also hinted at the existence of an SKU with a GeForce RTX 4060. 
Memory configurations on the HP Omen 17 are a tad confusing. The Core i9 variant supports up to 32 GB of DDR5 5,600 memory, while the Core i7 version scales its speed down to 4,800 MT/s. Both models can be configured with up to a 2 TB NVMe SSD. HP claims the materials used on the Omen 17 are sourced from ocean-bound and post-consumer recycled plastics. Gaming laptops often skip a webcam altogether, but HP has thrown in a 720p unit for basic video calls. 
HP has decked out the Omen 17 with plenty of I/O, including one Thunderbolt 4.0 port (40 Gbps), one Thunderbolt 3.0 port, three USB Type-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, a 3.5 mm audio jack, a mini DP port and an RJ45 Ethernet jack. Unlike other high-end gaming laptops out there that use a beefy 99.9 Wh battery, HP opts for a more compact 6-cell 83 Wh unit that supports up to 330 W fast charging. A Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 module is also included, but the make depends on the model.

Pricing and availability depend on the market.Launch Gaming Laptop Raptor Lake Geforce


Last year, Asus released quite a few ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 gaming laptops with various hardware configurations. However, these configurations revolved around the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS processor coupled with both AMD Radeon and NVIDIA GeForce mobile graphics solutions. Now, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 joins the Zephyrus G lineup as a new member and packs an Intel processor coupled with NVIDIA graphics.
The Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 arrives with an Intel Core i9-13900H processor and up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 mobile graphics. There is no information available on the hardware configurations that will be available yet, but all will come with a MUX Switch and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus, as well as a 16-inch QHD Nebula Display with 240 Hz refresh and capable of providing ""dazzling color and clarity,"" according to Asus.
Remains to see if the largest Zephyrus G-series to date will live up to its predecessors. The 14-inch Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 GA402RJ, for example, has visited Notebookcheck for an in-depth review back in October, when the model with AMD Ryzen 7 6800HS and Radeon RX 6700S impressed by delivering a lot of power in a small form factor.
Those interested in acquiring the new Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 should contact the local Asus representatives/resellers for pricing and availability details. If not, detailed information about the hardware configurations and their prices should become available in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.

While there is no AMD model, the Zenbook 14X OLED has received Raptor Lake processor options, as well as a more powerful NVIDIA RTX GPU.Laptop Launch


ASUS has refreshed the Zenbook 14X OLED, a year on from the introduction of its Alder Lake-powered predecessor. Unsurprisingly, ASUS has upgraded the Zenbook 14X OLED to Intel's newer Raptor Lake processors, with the Core i9-13900H the most powerful option for the 14-inch laptop. ASUS has also moved the Zenbook 14X OLED from the RTX 2050 to the RTX 3050, despite the introduction of even newer RTX 40 laptop GPUs during CES 2023.However, the RTX 2050 and RTX 3050 are based on the GA107 with 2,048 CUDA cores. Still, the adoption of the RTX 3050 should give this year's Zenbook 14X OLED nearly a 30% GPU performance uplift over its predecessor. Additionally, the new Zenbook 14X OLED offers up to 1 TB of PCIe 4.0 storage, 32 GB of LPDDR5-4800 RAM and a 70 Wh battery. All configurations feature twin Thunderbolt 4 ports too, as well as one USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A port and an HDMI 2.1 (TMDS) connection. In other words, the new Zenbook 14X OLED has an HDMI 2.0 connection that ASUS can market as HDMI 2.1.ASUS has also equipped the latest Zenbook 14X OLED with a 14.5-inch and 2.8K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display that has a 120 Hz refresh rate. Moreover, the 16:10 display supports touch inputs, covers 100% of the DCI-P3 colour space, is DisplayHDR True Black 600 certified and offers Delta E <2 factory colour calibration. Unfortunately, ASUS has not revealed how much the Zenbook 14X OLED costs nor when it will be available.Purchase the ASUS TUF Dash 15 (2022) on Amazon

Adding to its growing suite of Zenbook laptops, ASUS has revealed the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED (UX6404) at CES 2023. The notebook packs the latest components from Intel and Nvidia in addition to a beautiful display.
Starting with the design, the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED is undoubtedly a 'Zenbook' with a sharp angular chassis and a front dominated by a 2.8K screen with thin bezels. ASUS claims the notebook to have Military Grade Durability' as it is MIL-STD-810 certified. Finally, the machine is 18 mm thick and weighs 1.65 kg (2.2 lbs).
Inside, the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED comes with the 13th gen Raptor Lake Intel Core i9-13900H that is coupled with the GeForce RTX 40 graphics from Nvidia. However, ASUS hasn't specified which GPU the machine will employ. The company has also made sure to include a MUX switch to ensure you can take full advantage of the next-gen GeForce GPU. 
Furthermore, you can configure the notebook with a max 2 TB SSD with an advertised read speed of 6500 MB/s. There is also 16 GB of onboard DDR5 memory which you can augment with up to 32 GB using the spare SO-DIMM slot.
The port situation on the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED is also quite respectable. There is a Thunderbolt 4 port, a single USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, a full-size SD card slot, HDMI 2.1 out, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.
Moving on to the display, the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED has a 14.5-inch OLED display with a 2.8K resolution. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio and covers 100% of the DCI-P3 colorspace. For what it's worth, the panel is also Dolby Vision certified and Pantone Validated. The touch-screen capable models of the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED support ASUS Pen 2.0. Nifty features like the ASUS DialPad also make a return.
Last but not the least, the ASUS Zenbook Pro 14 OLED has a 76 Wh battery.
The final release date and pricing information of the Zenbook Pro 14 OLED remains under wraps as of now.

By combining NVIDIA's expertise in accelerated computing and the capabilities of the NVIDIA RTX™ 6000 Ada Generation professional GPU with Bionano's knowledge in extraction, enzymatic treatment, and analysis of ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) DNA molecules, the collaboration aims to develop on-premise and cloud-based solutions to keep pace with the anticipated data generation needs of high-throughput OGM workflows. The collaborative solution is projected to support analysis of 96 cancer workflows or just over 300 constitutional whole genomes per week and be integrated with Bionano's NxClinical™ software for variant interpretation and reporting. Bionano will preview the solution with NVIDIA at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) General Meeting, which will take place February 6-9, 2023, in Hollywood, Florida. 'Bionano is focused on continuous upscaling of our end-to-end genome mapping solutions, and we see this collaboration with NVIDIA as an important part of that effort,' said Erik Holmlin, PhD, president and chief executive officer of Bionano Genomics. 'We believe the solution we're developing with NVIDIA will accelerate OGM analysis and enable future expansion into areas including CAR T-cell therapy research and bioprocessing.' 'Bionano's optical genome mapping platform provides tremendous capability for genome-wide structural variant detection, which can have huge impact for cancer research and other areas of human health,' said George Vacek, global head of genomics alliances at NVIDIA. 'By accelerating Bionano's analysis, we will help achieve higher throughput in a smaller footprint at lower cost, enabling the application of this technology to new areas, both at scale and in smaller labs.'

Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, the novel approach can exponentially increase the number and quality of synthetic protein designs, which opens up the possibility to design new therapeutic targets for untreatable diseases and greatly reduces development time for new treatments.Evozyne began a collaboration with NVIDIA in 2022 to develop a new deep learning model that can learn the rules of protein function and use these rules to design new proteins with improved functions. The model, known as the Protein Transformer Variational AutoEncoder (ProT-VAE), is built on NVIDIA BioNeMo, a framework for efficiently training and deploying large language models for biology. The resulting model represents a new deep learning technology that enables advances for data-driven design of synthetic proteins with engineered functions. More information on the project is available here.""This result achieves the long-standing goal of creating new protein sequences that perform better than proteins currently found in nature.

64,Nvidia GeForce Now Review,Will Greenwald,2023-01-19 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-now,pcmag.com,"Nvidia GeForce Now provides the power of a high-end GPU, such as the RTX 4080, via streaming. As long as you have a fast and reliable internet connection, you can enjoy a gaming experience that rivals local PCs and consoles.","Google Stadia may be dead, but the game streaming category keeps getting stronger. PlayStation Plus Premium and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate both offer cloud-based gaming by remotely connecting to PlayStation or Xbox hardware via the internet, respectively. That isn't helpful for PC gamers, though, and that's why Nvidia GeForce Now exists. GeForce Now provides high-end gaming PC hardware that streams games directly to your less-than-high-end PC, mobile device, or TV. With the most recent update to its highest membership level, GeForce Now is an incredible service that provides some of the best graphics and performance possible, and makes it feel like you're using local hardware. That's under the best possible conditions, though; like all internet-based game streaming services, the experience will quickly go downhill if your connection dips.

How Much Does Nvidia GeForce Now Cost?

GeForce Now is offered in three tiers. There's a free tier that offers a 'basic rig' and game sessions that last one hour. Moving up the ladder, there's a $9.99 monthly Priority tier that provides a 'premium rig' with RTX tech, priority access to servers, 1080p resolution (up to 60 frames per second), and game sessions that last six hours. Finally, the $19.99 monthly Ultimate tier has been recently upgraded to offer a system with a 4080 RTX GPU that supports ultrawide monitors, 4K resolution, and up to 120fps (it hits 240fps in some cases). This tier also includes Nvidia Reflex with G-Sync for screens that support it. It's a significant upgrade; previously, the Ultimate tier leveraged 3080-powered systems. Nvidia provided us with early access to an Ultimate account for testing.

What Do You Need to Use Nvidia GeForce Now?

Due to the nature of game streaming, your biggest concern should be a fast, reliable internet connection. GeForce Now requires 5Mbps for 720p gaming at 60fps; 25Mbps for 1080p gaming at 60fps; 35Mbps for 1080p gaming at 240fps (or 2,560-by-1,440 gaming at 120fps); and 45Mbps for 4K gaming at 120fps. The service requires a latency of less than 80ms, with less than 40ms being ideal. Your best bet is either an Ethernet or 5GHz Wi-Fi connection; 2.4GHz isn't going to cut it. You probably won't want to use your phone 's data, either, because Nvidia estimates GeForce Now can use up to 11GB of data per hour at the highest settings.

If possible, you should also be physically close to a GeForce Now data center. Nvidia has nine centers across North America, mostly located near major cities. There's a data center in New York City, so testing in Brooklyn (where I live) presents a geographically ideal situation. This doesn't mean you should fret if you're a few hundred miles from the nearest data center, but that distance can certainly increase lag.

In terms of PC hardware, you'll need at least a 2GHz, dual-core CPU; 4GB of RAM; and integrated graphics (any GPU made within the last 10 years should work). For Macs, any Apple computer made from 2009 onward will be compatible. GeForce Now also works with Android and iOS mobile devices, Chromebooks, Android/Google TV-based media streamers and TVs, and most 2021 and 2022 LG and Samsung TVs. Dedicated Android, Mac, Windows, and smart TV apps are available, and the service can also be accessed through Chrome, Edge, and (on iOS) Safari web browsers.

You'll probably want a gamepad to play most games on GeForce Now, and fortunately, most major ones are supported. You can use any current Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or two Joy-Cons paired as one controller), PlayStation (DualSense or DualShock 4), or Xbox controller connected via Bluetooth, along with several third-party gamepads like the Moga XP5-A Plus, Steelseries Stratus Duo, and Razer Kishi V2 and Wolverine. I had no issue pairing an Xbox Wireless Controller with my Google TV-based Hisense U8H TV.

BYOG: Bring Your Own Games

GeForce Now doesn't provide any games on its own, but you can use it to play free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact. Otherwise, you must already own the GeForce Now-compatible games on a supported online store. You can link your Epic Game Store, Steam, and Ubisoft accounts to GeForce Now, and play any compatible games through the service.

As of this writing, GeForce Now runs 1,512 games, with 56 supporting RTX raytracing and 10 supporting Reflex. Games with raytracing include Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman III, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Games with Reflex cover the span of major competitive games, including Apex Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, DOTA 2, Fortnite, League of Legends, and Rainbow Six: Siege.

There are many games that lack GeForce Now support, particularly titles from Activision Blizzard; you won't find Call of Duty, Overwatch 2, or World of Warcraft. As a result, you should check GeForce Now's supported games(Opens in a new window) list before using the service.

After syncing my EGS and Steam accounts to GeForce Now, I found that my game collection included 89 compatible titles, including Destiny 2, No Man's Sky, and Satisfactory.

Amazing Game Streaming With a Strong Connection

I tested GeForce Now on an RTX 3060-based gaming laptop; on a more modest travel laptop with integrated graphics; and on a Hisense U8H TV. All three devices connected to my TP-Link AX5400 Wi-Fi router over 5GHz Wi-Fi, and through it to my Spectrum gigabit cable internet service.

The service worked flawlessly on my primary PC. I loaded Apex Legends, Genshin Impact, Satisfactory, and The Witcher 3 through the GeForce Now Windows app, and they all ran without issue. There were a few delays when first launching the games since they had to install and initialize on the remote system. This was a one-time process for each (though Satisfactory and The Witcher 3 experienced additional short pauses when launching, in which the client displayed a Steam interface before the game loaded). It's worth noting The Witcher 3 actually made me click Play on the Steam client to open up a separate GOG.com client each time. Apex Legends was worse; I had to reauthorize my EA account each time I loaded the game. These aren't huge issues, and you might face the annoying Apex Legends issue just as often with a local installation. However, they made the experience feel less than streamlined.

In terms of performance, the games ran in a fantastic fashion. All four loaded at 1080p on my monitor, and with the exception of The Witcher 3, the games all supported the full 2,560-by-1,080 ultrawide resolution and generally kept a rock-solid 60 frames per second (the limitations of my current monitor). Graphics were smooth and high quality; Satisfactory actually looked a bit better than when I played it locally on my primary computer, and without it physically getting hot as it tried to keep up with my less-than-optimized factory system (like it usually does). Frame rates were high and consistent across the board, with a few understandable dropped frames.

The Witcher 3 also looked excellent and performed smoothly, even with raytracing enabled. The game was rendered at 1080p, so it ran better than when locally played on a PlayStation 5. To be fair, the PS5 version ran smoothly in 4K Performance mode, but dropped frames with the full raytracing suite enabled.

Most impressively, every one of these games played about as responsively as if I loaded them on the PC itself. Both mouse -and- keyboard and gamepad controls reacted instantly, and the experience was smooth enough that I genuinely couldn't detect enough latency difference between the streaming games and the local games, with the advantage of the 4080 remote system making the streaming games actually look and perform better. I could comfortably run and snipe in Apex Legends without feeling like my inputs were sluggish. It's genuinely impressive.

GeForce Now didn't fare quite as well on my lower-end travel laptop, which tends to have more finicky Wi-Fi (it's about 15 feet from the router on the other side of a bookshelf). At its best, it looked good and played just as responsively as my main system in testing. It tended to suffer from connection dips, though, and this caused my game streams to degrade in visual quality and suffer lag. This is likely due to the cheaper laptop's Wi-Fi chip, but it's a factor to keep in mind if your GeForce Now experience isn't particularly stable. Your network environment may vary, but in my Wi-Fi-congested Brooklyn apartment, it certainly seems like I need to have my computer physically within arm's length of my router for the best performance.

The GeForce Now experience through the Google TV client on my television wasn't quite as hit-or-miss, but it also wasn't as good as on my main PC. During one session, The Witcher 3 loaded and played quite well, with responsive controls and no issues. In another session, Dying Light 2 had noticeable control lag and felt as if I was playing the game with the TV's Game mode disabled (which produces an input lag of around 100 milliseconds, up from just 8.1ms).

If you want to play on a TV using the GeForce Now client, note that game streams are limited to 1080p60; you can't play in native 4K or at 120 or 240 fps. Currently, only Samsung TVs can use GeForce Now at 4K resolution.

Why You Should Game on a PC

Keep Your Router Next to You—It's Worth It

Nvidia GeForce Now Ultimate is incredible under the best conditions. With a fast and consistent network connection, games are just about as responsive as they would be on local hardware, and actually look and perform far better unless you already have a system with a RTX 4080 or equivalent graphics card. If there's anything that can cause connection glitches, however, the experience can become frustrating or outright unacceptable. Nvidia has really put together an impressive streaming system on its end, but you still need to have all of your network ducks in a row to have a good time.

Assuming that you have the best internet connection possible and that the games you want to play are available on the service, GeForce Now is a feasible gaming PC replacement. For $20 a month you're getting remote hardware worth a few thousand dollars, and as long as your network is fast and consistent, that hardware will feel like it's sitting right on your desk.",pcmag.com,492,news,US,en,Will Greenwald,https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/03Xn5JniJlTVfdGBHOvvnaX-20.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1674049841.jpg,False,@pcmag,11.018289,4b34fa207e36be5170f86e3b13e15763,0.0,0.0,0.9999313354492188,0.9999977350234985,0.0,0.0
65,How to use Nvidia ShadowPlay to record your gameplay,Monica J. White,2023-01-21 00:00:08,date,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/use-nvidia-shadowplay-for-recording-gameplay/,digitaltrends.com,"If you have an Nvidia graphics card and want to record your gameplay or take instant replays, Nvidia Shadowplay is a great tool. Here's how to use Nvidia Share.","Nvidia Shadowplay, also known as Nvidia share, is a tool that lets gamers with Nvidia graphics cards record and stream your gameplay live. It's also an in-game overlay that lets you take screenshots or check your frames per second (fps). Many users of Nvidia cards have access to this feature, but do you know how to enable Nvidia Shadowplay to record your gameplay? In this guide, we will show you step-by-step how to use Nvidia Shadowplay. We will also cover everything else you need to know about the program. Before we get started, Nvidia has rebranded Shadowplay to Nvidia Share, we will be using these terms interchangeably throughout this guide. Nvidia Shadowplay continues to be the better-known name of the feature, but ultimately, both Shadowplay and Share are essentially the same program.
How to use Nvidia Shadowplay to record your gameplayNvidia Share can be accessed only through GeForce Experience. This is Nvidia's software that is responsible for, amongst other things, helping you download and install drivers, optimize game settings, and more. Step 1: Launch Nvidia Share by pressing the keyboard shortcut Alt + Z. If you can't get it to open, you may not have installed GeForce Experience. You can download it directly from Nvidia's website. Step 2: Directly below the toggle for the in-game overlay, select Settings to tinker with a few options before you start recording. 
 Step 3: The two crucial settings that you absolutely should adjust before recording are Privacy Control and Recordings: Scroll all the way down in Settings until you find Privacy Control, then enable Desktop Capture. Without this, you won't be able to record at all.
In Recordings, you can select the folder in which your video recordings will end up. Make sure you check it out prior to recording, especially if you have limited space on one of your drives. 
 Step 4: Other settings worth considering include: 
Keyboard shortcuts: Adjust the shortcut used to bring up Nvidia Shadowplay during gameplay, as well as other handy key bindings.
Video capture: In this section, you can set the video quality, resolution, fps, and length of the Instant Replay feature. If you're not sure what Instant Replay is, check out our section on it below.
Audio: This section lets you separate and mute certain audio tracks. It's useful if you'll be playing a game while also using voice communication.
 Click around and change the settings that are important to you. If you find you can't change any, you may have Instant Replay turned on. Disable it first, then try to adjust your settings again (don't forget to turn Instant Replay back on if you want it). 
 Step 5: Now it's time to actually record some gameplay. Open up the game you want to record. You can then open up Shadowplay again by pressing the Alt + Z shortcut, or by selecting the small overlay icon in the corner. Selecting Share will open the in-game overlay. This overlay can be launched at any time, even if you're not currently gaming. 
 Step 6: Before you begin recording, decide whether you also want to record your webcam and your microphone. You can adjust this in the Nvidia Shadowplay overlay, on the right side of the interface. Select the Webcam and Microphone icons to toggle them on or off. When you're ready to start recording, you can press Record directly in Nvidia Shadowplay, followed by Start, or via the default keyboard shortcut of Alt + F9. The same shortcut is used to stop recording when you're done. Alternatively, you can bring the Shadowplay interface back up with Alt + Z and then stop recording manually. Step 7: The recording will be saved to the folder you chose when setting up your Nvidia Share. By default, recordings can be found in C: > Users > YourName  > Videos. Congratulations! You've just recorded your first video with Nvidia Shadowplay. However, there is much more that this program is capable of, so keep reading below to find out what else you can use it for. How to use Instant Replay in Nvidia ShadowplayInstant Replay is a unique feature offered by Nvidia Share. When enabled, it constantly runs in the background and records your gameplay during the entirety of your gaming session. Instant Replay can save up to 20 minutes of gameplay without you ever needing to press the record button. This means that all your spontaneous-yet-shareable moments get saved on your computer, and then if you don't decide to keep them, they are overwritten as you play. Due to the 20-minute limit, the stored videos do not take up too much storage space. Step 1: Open GeForce Experience and click the Share icon in the top-right corner, or bring up the overlay with the Nvidia Shadowplay hotkey of Alt + Z. 
 Step 2: In the in-game overlay, select Instant Replay, then select Settings. Step 3: Adjust the maximum length of time that you want Shadowplay to record for, as well as various video settings. Select Save when you're done. 
 Step 4: When you're ready to let Instant Replay start recording, select it in the overlay and then select Turn On. From that point on, Instant Replay will save your gameplay whenever you're playing. If something interesting happens and you want it to be preserved instead of overwritten, pull up the Nvidia Shadowplay in-game overlay and press Save. Alternatively, use the default keyboard shortcut: Alt + F10. Once saved, the videos will end up in the same folder you chose when setting up Nvidia Share. 

How to broadcast live in Nvidia ShadowplayAside from recording your games, you can also use Nvidia Share to stream them live on various platforms. Nvidia currently supports direct streaming to Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube. While you will need to adjust a few settings before you get started, the streaming itself is easy. Step 1: Open GeForce Experience with Alt + Z to enter Nvidia Share. In the overlay, select Broadcast Live, and then Settings. You will be presented with various settings that are exclusive to this section of Shadowplay. Step 2: Pick which platform you are going to stream on, then select the video quality, resolution, frame rate, and bit rate. Step 3: Pick custom overlays, such as something to cover your in-game chat. Step 4: Check whether the ingest server is correct for your current location. Step 5: When you are ready to start streaming, go back to the Nvidia Shadowplay overlay, select Broadcast Live, and then Start. This will produce a smaller window with a few options for you to fill out. 
Choose the platform you'll be streaming on.
Log on to your platform of choice via the overlay.
Name your video using up to a maximum of 140 characters.
Pick the location of the stream as well as the audience you'll be streaming to.
 When you're done setting up, simply press Broadcast in order to start streaming or use the Alt + F8 keyboard shortcut. Stop streaming the exact same way. 
 

How to take screenshots in Nvidia ShadowplayThe screenshot features in Nvidia Shadowplay are quite fun and super-quick to use. It's a great alternative to all the other ways you can take a screenshot in Windows. Step 1: Open the GeForce Experience app by pressing Alt + Z on your keyboard. Step 2: On the far-left side of the overlay, you will find three different options: 
Screenshot: Exactly what it says on the label. You can also use Alt + F1 to take screenshots without pulling up the overlay.
Photo mode: Access this using Alt + F2. In this section, Nvidia has a lot of neat features that can help you alter your screenshots before you take them. Feel free to play with filters, including artificial sharpening and various color modes.
Game filter: This feature lets you add a filter to your game. It's basically a constant overlay that changes the way your game looks during your gameplay. It's useful if you're colorblind or your eyes get tired, but it may have some impact on your gaming performance.
 

How to use Nvidia Shadowplay for performance monitoringAnother fun option in Nvidia Shadowplay is called Performance Monitoring. In this section of GeForce Experience, you can access a live summary of your graphics card's performance. Readily-available information includes the GPU clock, temperature, voltage, utilization, power consumption, fan speeds, memory clock, and even CPU utilization. Step 1: In order to access this feature, simply open up the Shadowplay overlay by using the Alt + Z keyboard shortcut. The option to view performance metrics is found on the far right side of the overlay. Step 2: If you have a recent Nvidia GPU, like an RTX 40-series GPU (at least GTX 16-series and newer), you will also have access to a section called Performance Tuning, located right below the monitoring section. If you'd like to use it, you will first have to turn off Instant Replay in the overlay. You can try out Automatic Performance Tuning to optimize your graphics card without delving into any particular settings. This will cause GeForce Experience to check each setting for you and find ways to improve your card's performance. Before you try out the Automatic Performance Tuning, make sure your drivers are up to date and close all other programs, or the feature may not work.
Nvidia Shadowplay FAQDoes Nvidia Shadowplay affect fps? Nvidia Shadowplay comes with a host of fun, easy-to-use, gamer-oriented features. It's definitely a great tool and a welcome addition from Nvidia. However, there is no denying that it will affect your fps to some degree. Using Instant Replay, Record, and Broadcast Live is very likely to lower your frame rates. Your gaming performance may be affected just a little or a whole lot -- this depends on your graphics card. If you want to avoid having low frame rates, keep Instant Replay turned off and only record when you really want to. Is Nvidia Shadowplay free to use? Nvidia Shadowplay is free for all users who own one of Nvidia's graphics cards. Not all cards are supported by this feature, but it's accessible enough that most GPU owners will be able to use it. There are no extra subscription costs required: All you need is to download the free GeForce Experience program to get started. Which graphics cards can use Nvidia Shadowplay? There are a few system requirements that users must meet in order to run Nvidia Shadowplay. Shadowplay is mostly available to the owners of the best graphics cards released by Nvidia, although there is a fair amount of older models that also support this feature. You can use Nvidia Shadowplay if your system meets the following requirements: 
Desktop: You own an Nvidia GeForce GPU newer than the GTX 900M, including GTX 16, 10, 900, 800, 700, 600, and 900M, or one of Nvidia's RTX cards, including 30-series and 20-series units.
Laptop: You must have at least an Nvidia GTX 850M, 860M, 950M, or 960M series card or higher.
 You can find the full list of requirements on Nvidia's website. Today's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox Check your inbox! Please provide a valid email address to continue.

The company initially launched only the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080 before making the RTX 4070 Ti available for purchase earlier this month. Following the RTX 4070 release, NVIDIA is also expected to announce the even more affordable RTX 4060. Marketing pictures related to the RTX 4070 Ti were posted online by GPU-maker Galax, with one of the images clearly showing an RTX 4070 retail box. The images have since been removed, but not before VideoCardz was able to grab a few screenshots. Curiously, the packages seem to mention the RTX 4070 Ti on the side and the top, suggesting the 4070 branding could be a mistake. Something else pointing to the fact that this could be a mistake is the design of the card itself. An image of the card next to the 'RTX 4070' box shows a triple-slot behemoth, which is a little surprising for what would essentially be a mid-range product. NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Graphics Card Image Courtesy: Galax (Via VideoCardz) While things seem to indicate that the RTX 4070 branding at the front of the Galax retail boxes is an error, it shows that the company is preparing RTX 4070 marketing material along with the RTX 4070 Ti promos. If that is true, it would suggest that the RTX 4070 is in the pipeline and is likely launching soon. There are plenty of leaks and rumors that the RTX 4070 will be released in Q1, 2023, so the confusion is understandable. Rumors suggest that the RTX 4070 will be based on the AD104 GPU like the 4070 Ti, but in a watered-down avatar, with only 46 out of 60 streaming multiprocessors (SM) enabled. The card is expected to have 5,888 CUDA cores, a significant drop from the 7,680 of the 4070Ti. It is also expected to have 46 RT cores and 184 Tensor cores. The RTX 4070 is also tipped to get the same 12GB of GDDR6X memory as the 4070 Ti, with a 192-bit memory bus, 21Gbps memory speed, and 504 GB/s bandwidth. Apart from the desktop RTX 40 lineup, NVIDIA also recently unveiled the RTX 40-series GPUs for laptops. At CES 2023, the company said the entire range of RTX 4000 GPUs will come to laptops, starting with the entry-level RTX 4050 and going up to the top-of-the-line RTX 4090. Laptops featuring the new NVIDIA chips are expected to go on pre-order on Feb. 1 before being available for purchase from Feb. 8.

Nvidia Broadcast 1.4 launches AI driven eye contact app By Nidhi Bhardwaj: The Eye Contact feature relies on AI to simulate what your eyes would look like if you were looking at the camera instead of elsewhere, according to the recent blog post of Nvidia on 12 January. As reported, the Nvidia streaming software has the option to replace your eyes with simulated ones that are aligned with your camera. The eye contact feature coming to the Nvidia Broadcast app will make sure that it looks like you are making eye contact with the camera even though you are not, and it all happens using AI. .@NVIDIA Broadcast is a live-streaming, video conferencing and voicemail app. The latest version introduces one really cool new feature - eye-contact technology that modifies live video so that your eyes always seem like they are looking straight at the camera.1/3 pic.twitter.com/rnf7bAaoFV— Bojan Tunguz (@tunguz) January 21, 2023 What's new in this Nvidia app? Nvidia Broadcast 1.4 technology is said to not control the eye movement of the speaker, rather analyse it. This technology aims to deepfake the eyes with its feature of copying the eye colour and analysing the gaze to allow blinking, to make it appear natural, a recent blog mentioned. Nvidia's new technology was mentioned to have been trained smoothly with such features. Nvidia further said, ""There's even a disconnect feature in case you look too far away.' Previously, several companies have tried experimenting with deepfakes in the looks and voices of celebrities. Well this time, Nvidia has trained its AI model to mimic millions of eye colours along with various lighting combinations. Source: Nvidia Quick glance at the Nvidia Broadcast 1.4 The new effect of eye contact called beta is deployed in this AI model to morph the eyes of the speaker. Along with beta, Vignette is also undertaken to simulate the lens effect by shading the corners of the frame for cosmetic effects. Nvidia has also focused on updating the model with virtual background effects to blur, replace and remove. The updated effect uses temporal information to improve segmentation quality and stability, according to recent information by Nvidia. The app would also promote the mirroring camera preview and selfie snapshots option, along with tooltips for better accessibility. Target audience of Nvidia The company has described the new AI app as being useful for content creators who want to record them while reading notes. The user can start using the eye contact feature after updating to version 1.4 of Nvidia Broadcast. However, this feature is currently in beta, so it might not work well as per the user's wish. Since it is based on AI, users can help the company improve the AI through video trials.

The survival rate for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is low, and patients with long-term risks of SCA are not adequately alerted. Understanding SCA's characteristics will be key to developing preventive strategies. Many lives could be saved if SCA's early onset could be detected or predicted. Monitoring heart signals continuously is essential for diagnosing sporadic cardiac dysfunction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used to continuously monitor heart function without having to go to the hospital. A zeolite-based dry electrode can provide safe on-skin ECG acquisition while the subject is out-of-hospital and facilitate long-term monitoring. To the ECG signal, a low-power 1 
μ
W read-out circuit was designed and implemented in our prior work. However, having long-term ECG monitoring outside the hospital, i.e., high battery life, and low power consumption while transmission and reception of ECG signal are crucial. This paper proposes a prototype with a 10-bit resolution ADC and nRF24L01 transceivers placed 5 m apart. The system uses the 2.4 GHz worldwide ISM frequency band with GFSK modulation to wirelessly transmit digitized ECG bits at 250 kbps data rate to a physician's computer (or similar) for continuous monitoring of ECG signals; the power consumption is only 11.2 mW and 4.62 mW during transmission and reception, respectively, with a low bit error rate of ≤0.1%. Additionally, a subject-wise cross-validated, three-fold, optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the Physionet-SCA dataset was implemented on NVIDIA Jetson to identify the irregular heartbeats yielding an accuracy of 89% with a run time of 5.31 s. Normal beat classification has an F1 score of 0.94 and a ROC score of 0.886. Thus, this paper integrates the ECG acquisition and processing unit with low-power wireless transmission and CNN model to detect irregular heartbeats.

Nvidia Earnings Update
 
Wide-moat Nvidia (
NVDA
) reported fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter sales consistent with management's guidance, with gaming slightly ahead of our expectations and data center a bit weaker. We foresee healthy growth for the data center segment, thanks to the firm's newest H100 data center graphics processing unit. The H100 is 9 times faster than its predecessor in artificial intelligence training and up to 30 times faster in AI inferencing for transformer-based large language models like Open AI's ChatGPT (generative pretrained transformer). We believe AI models like ChatGPT use thousands of GPUs to be trained, with competition among Microsoft, Google, and others supporting our forecast for Nvidia's data center segment to grow at a 19% CAGR over the next five years.
 
Meaningful Growth for Nvidia Seen from AI
 
Despite our positive outlook, we maintain our $200 fair value estimate, as we think our estimates already incorporate meaningful growth driven by the proliferation of AI. The shares are up 45% year to date and 85% since mid-October lows, as we believe the market has already rewarded Nvidia for its exposure to the likes of ChatGPT.
 
Fourth-quarter sales declined 21% year over year and grew 2% sequentially to $6.1 billion. Gaming sales fell 46% year over year to $1.8 billion as the firm navigated the crash in cryptocurrency mining demand and elevated channel inventories. Although management said the channel inventory correction for gaming GPUs is largely in the rearview mirror, we don't see quarterly gaming GPU sales reverting to the normalized level of $2.5 billion (per management) for at least a few more quarters, if not longer. Data center sales grew 11% year over year to $3.6 billion but fell 6% sequentially due to a slight pause in cloud spending and weaker sales in China. Gross margin rose nearly 10 percentage points sequentially to 63.3% due to a lack of inventory write-offs.

's pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard has been a highly debated topic in recent times. The conversation around the deal only appears to be intensifying, particularly after Microsoft's recent meeting with EU regulators. During the meeting, 
Microsoft
 looked to make its case, mostly countering Sony's opposition to the deal. One of the biggest points about the Activision purchase pertains to the potential implications for the 
Call of Duty
 franchise.
 
Sony argues that the acquisition would grant Microsoft too much control over a franchise like 
Call of Duty 
and the potential restrictions may give the company an unfair advantage. However, Microsoft counters this argument claiming that it's not in the company's best interest to restrict access to Activision-Blizzard properties and that it remains committed to continuing offering 
Call of Duty
 and other IPs to other platforms. In fact, the tech giant has explicitly stated that Microsoft offered to 
continue bringing 
Call of Duty
 to PlayStation
 for the foreseeable future in a long-term agreement.
 
 Rallying Support from Nvidia and Nintendo for Microsoft's Acquisition 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now, in what looks to be the latest attempt at gaining support for the acquisition, Microsoft announced that the company is partnering up with Nintendo, just as the Xbox maker met with EU regulators recently. Accordingly, the 10-year agreement will bring 
Call of Duty
 to Nintendo players on the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity. While 
Microsoft has assured 
Call of Duty
's performance on Nintendo
, the company is yet to share more details on the specifics of the deal.
 
But Nintendo wasn't the only partnership Microsoft made public during the week. Merely hours after, the company announced that 
Microsoft partnered up with Nvidia
 in another 10-year agreement. As per the deal, Microsoft will be bringing its Xbox PC games to Nvidia GeForce Now. This means that players can either buy Xbox PC games on the Windows Store or from third-party stores like Epic Games and Steam to stream via GeForce Now. While the agreement covers Xbox PC games in general, the announcement specifically singles out 
Call of Duty
 as a title that will be made available on the platform as a result of its Nvidia partnership.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is likely a calculated move from Microsoft in an effort to entice the regulators in the company's favor. Of course, while the tech giant has managed to sway support from the likes of Nvidia and Nintendo, it still hasn't been able to gain its most vocal opposer's favor. Microsoft has been repeatedly trying to convince Sony that 
Call of Duty
 will remain on the platform for years to come. However, the two companies haven't managed to agree on terms. At a recent press event in Brussels, Microsoft President Brad Smith even claimed that its own 10-year agreement with Sony remains unsigned and that the company is still willing to negotiate terms with the PlayStation maker. Incidentally, this comes at a time when Sony's 
PlayStation deal with Activision-Blizzard is almost at an end
.
 
So far, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan has called Microsoft's 
Call of Duty
 agreement 'inadequate on many levels,' though details of the potential deal, in particular, haven't been made public. Previously, the company has also claimed that 
Microsoft's information requests amount to harassment
. Microsoft has also pointed the finger at Sony, accusing the company pays off developers to keep games from Xbox Game Pass. Even at its recent Brussels event, Brad Smith inquired if the regulators would rather 'kill a deal and cement Sony's position and its 80 percent share in the European Economic Area' as opposed to letting the 'future go forward with behavioral guardrails and remedies' to bring 
Call of Duty
 to 150 million more people.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although hostilities between the two companies seem to be ongoing, Sony isn't the only company that has opposed or raised concerns about the $68.7 billion acquisition. The UK's CMA recently revealed that 
half of Xbox rivals are concerned about the Activision purchase
. While it doesn't name the opposing parties, both Nvidia and Google were reportedly concerned with the deal previously, though Nvidia has since turned in favor of Xbox.
 
Despite the vocal opposition, few others from the tech industry have come in support of the acquisition. Back in October 2022, 
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick supported the Activision deal
, claiming that Microsoft's takeover will be a net positive to the industry and that it will help draw in more gamers to the market. Other industry players like Tencent and Meta have also shared similar sentiments, along with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) which believes the deal will yield better outcomes for workers and union-related matters.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Despite the seemingly growing support for Microsoft, there are questions that still loom over the potential implications of the company gaining control over Activision-Blizzard. In December, the 
FTC sued to block the Activision acquisition
 claiming the deal would allow Microsoft to stifle competition. The regulator further mentioned that the acquisition could translate to Microsoft ""manipulating Activision's pricing, degrading Activision's game quality or player experience on rival consoles and gaming services"" as well as ""changing the terms and timing of access to Activision's content, or withholding content from competitors entirely.""
 
This was followed by the CMA's own investigations on the pending deal. The UK regulator raises concerns over game exclusivity and cloud gaming. While 
Microsoft holds a commanding position in the cloud gaming market
, the CMA points out that acquiring Activision may bump up Microsoft's cloud gaming market share to about 60-70 percent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amid CMA's ongoing efforts, the EU regulators have stated that a final decision regarding the Activision acquisition will be conveyed by April 11. As of now, it's unclear how Microsoft's deals with Nintendo and Nvidia will impact the regulatory decisions. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary if the Xbox maker managed to forge more 
Call of Duty
-related partnerships, especially since the tech giant has already gained approval from Brazil, Serbia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile regions. Reportedly, 
China will also approve Microsoft's Activision purchase
 in the near future.
 
Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the events surrounding the Activision acquisition will pan out. Of course, support from both regional markets and industry players on the scale of Nvidia and Nintendo will likely skew things to Microsoft's side. But the end decision and the answer to the question of too much power in 
Microsoft
's hands with Activision will fall onto the regulatory bodies.

NVIDIA
, 
ETH Zurich
, and the 
University of Toronto
 open-sourced 
Orbit
, a simulation-based robot learning framework. Orbit includes wrappers for four learning libraries, a suite of benchmark tasks, and simulation for several robot platforms, as well as interfaces for deploying trained agents on physical robots.


Orbit is built on NVIDIA's 
Isaac Sim
 simulation platform, which provides tools for designing environments along with an engine for photorealistic rendering and physics simulation. Out of the box, Orbit includes models of several sensors, robot actuators, and both rigid and deformable objects, such as dishwashers and cloth. It also includes pre-built simulation environments for nearly two dozen learning tasks, such as stacking blocks or folding a cloth; the framework supports several learning paradigms, including reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning. Orbit can also run control policies on a physical robot, either by using 
ZeroMQ
 to send joint commands or by exporting the policy to hardware that runs ROS. According to the NVIDIA team:




By open-sourcing this framework, we aim to reduce the overhead for developing new applications and provide a unified platform for future robot learning research. While we continue improving and adding more features to the framework, we hope that researchers contribute to making it a one-stop solution for robotics research.




RL is a common technique for developing control systems for robots. However, training a pure RL controller using the physical robot in the real world could take a long time, so researchers often train virtual agents that interact with a simulated environment, taking advantage of the availability of physics-based computer game engines and high-quality image rendering. InfoQ has covered several of these systems, such as Meta's 
Habitat
 environment and MIT's 
ThreeDWorld
 (TDW).


Orbit is based on Isaac Sim, a ""scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data-generation tool,"" which is itself built on NVIDIA's 
Omniverse
 3D simulation platform. Omniverse uses the 
Universal Scene Description
 (USD) format, originally developed by Pixar, as its basis for defining 3D environments. Orbit's key contribution is its abstraction layer, which simplifies environment design and transfer of trained policies to real-world robots.


The top level abstractions in Orbit are the 
world
, which represents every object in the simulated environment, including the simulated robot hardware; and the 
agent
, which represents the robot control software, and is responsible for reading robot sensor data and controlling robot actuators. An additional abstraction, the 
task
, includes the world, a subset of the agent, and a 
task logic
 component, which provides goals, metrics, and episode control for learning.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04195


To demonstrate Orbit's ability to train agents for physical robots, the team used Orbit to control a 
Franka Emika
 robot manipulator via ZeroMQ. The robot performed teleoperation as well as waypoint tracking with obstacle avoidance. The researchers also trained a locomotion policy for an 
ANYmal-D
 quadruped robot using Orbit's simulated environment, then deployed the trained agent onto a physical robot.


In a Twitter thread about the work, several users asked questions about how Orbit relates to NVIDIA's other RL platforms, such as 
Isaac Gym
. Orbit project advisor 
Prof. Animesh Garg
 replied:




IsaacGym was built to showcase the GPU based TensorAPI based physX. Omni IsaacGym is built as an example to showcase the [IsaacGym] capability in IsaacSim. Orbit is the IsaacSim interface for environment design and unified examples library. [IsaacGym] users can migrate to IsaacSim or Orbit.




The 
Orbit source code
 is available on GitHub.

NVIDIA Hopper H100 Insights provided by Liftr Insights

""The Hopper H100 is hot! We get a lot of questions from our clients about when, if, and where they will see it,"" says Tab Schadt, CEO of Liftr Insights. ""We can show them trends with past deployments to give clues about more current items.""

For example, the most recent generation of accelerator from NVIDIA, including its A10 and A100 GPUs, had a similar announcement and wasn't seen in public clouds until November 2020, roughly six months after the announcement. Today that generation accounts for over 18% of accelerated instance types.

Why is the appearance in public clouds important to investors and marketing intelligence analysts?

""It's where the rubber meets the road,"" says Schadt. ""It's a lot of talk until they are being used. Being used by cloud providers has become a strong measure of success.""

The initial sighting of an instance is important. Also important is the subsequent growth. Liftr data show that while certain clouds deployed some instances (such as the A100), most of the growth took up to a year to manifest after the initial introduction. That expansion of types and into other regions provides signals about the adoption rate, interest, and willingness of the clouds to further invest. Their investment mirrors the interest in the larger market.

""Liftr data tells us that they don't always invest beyond a few types at a few regions,"" says Schadt. ""That provides helpful signals to investors seeking signs of life and success.""

So, while the first sighting of the H100 in the public clouds will be important, watching the growth from that point forward provides even more valuable information to those making bets on NVIDIA, GPUs in general, or semiconductors as a whole.

GTC 
-- AT&T Corp. and NVIDIA today announced a collaboration in which AT&T will continue to transform its operations and enhance sustainability by using NVIDIA-powered AI for processing data, optimizing service-fleet routing and building digital avatars for employee support and training.
 
AT&T is the first telecommunications provider to explore the use of a full suite of NVIDIA AI offerings. This includes enhancing its data processing using the 
NVIDIA AI Enterprise
 software suite, which includes the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark; enabling real-time vehicle routing and optimization with 
NVIDIA cuOpt
; adopting digital avatars with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and NVIDIA Tokkio; and utilizing conversational AI with NVIDIA Riva.
 
'We strive each day to deliver the most efficient global network, as we drive towards net zero emissions in our operations,' said Andy Markus, chief data officer at AT&T. 'Working with NVIDIA to drive AI solutions across our business will help enhance experiences for both our employees and customers.'
 
'Industries are embracing a new era in which chatbots, recommendation engines and accelerated libraries for data optimization help produce AI-driven innovations,' said Manuvir Das, vice president of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. 'Our work with AT&T will help the company better mine its data to drive new services and solutions for the AI-powered telco.'
 
The Data Dilemma
AT&T, which has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2035, has instituted broad initiatives to make its operations more efficient. A major challenge is optimizing energy consumption while providing network infrastructure that delivers data at high speeds.
 
AT&T processes more than 590 petabytes of data on average a day. That is the equivalent of about 6.5 million 4K movies or more than 8x the content housed in the U.S. Library of Congress if all its collections were digitized.
 
Telecoms aiming to reduce energy consumption face challenges across their operations. Within networks, the radio access network (RAN) consumes 73% of energy, while core network services, data centers and operations use 13%, 9% and 5%, respectively, 
according to the GSMA
, a mobile industry trade group.
 
AT&T first adopted NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark to capitalize on energy-efficient GPUs across its AI and data science pipelines. This helped boost its operational efficiency across everything from training AI models and maintaining network quality and optimization, to reducing customer churn and improving fraud detection.
 
Of the data and AI pipelines targeted with Spark-RAPIDS, AT&T saves about half of its cloud computing spend and sees faster performance, while enabling reductions in its carbon footprint.
 
Enhanced Field Dispatch Services 
AT&T, which operates one of the largest field dispatch teams to service its customers, is currently testing NVIDIA cuOpt software to enhance its field dispatch capabilities to handle more complex technician routing and optimization challenges.
 
Routing requires trillions of computations to factor in a variety of factors, from traffic and weather conditions to customer change of plans or a technician's skill level, where a complicated job might then require an additional truck roll.
 
In early trials, cuOpt delivered solutions in 10 seconds, while the same computation on x86 CPUs took 1,000 seconds. The results yielded a 40% reduction in cloud costs and allowed technicians to complete more service calls each day. NVIDIA cuOpt allows AT&T to run nearly continuous dispatch optimization software by combining NVIDIA RAPIDS with local search heuristics algorithms and metaheuristics such as Tabu search.
 
Pleasing Customers, Speeding Network Design
As part of its efforts to improve productivity for its more than 150,000 employees, AT&T is moving to adopt NVIDIA Omniverse ACE and NVIDIA Tokkio, cloud-native AI microservices, workflows and application frameworks for developers to easily build, customize and deploy interactive avatars that see, perceive, intelligently converse and provide recommendations to enhance the customer service experience.
 
For conversational AI, the carrier also uses the NVIDIA Riva software development kit and is examining other customer service and operations use cases for digital twins and generative AI.
 
AT&T also is 
taking advantage
 of fast 5G and its fiber network to deliver 
NVIDIA GeForce NOW
™ cloud gaming at 120 frames per second on mobile and 240 FPS at home.

Each offering will include pre-trained models, data processing frameworks, personalization databases, inference engines, and APIs that enterprises can access from a browser, Nvidia said.
 
Generative AI in action
 
Financial data provider Morningstar is already studying how it can use test-based NeMo to extract useful information about markets from raw data, drawing on the expertise of its staff to tune the models, according to Nvidia.
 
The Picasso service will enable enterprises to train models to generate custom images, videos, and even 3D models in the cloud. Nvidia is partnering with Adobe to deliver such generative capabilities inside Adobe's tools for creative professionals such as Photoshop and After Effects.
 
Nvidia is seeking to clean up graphical generative AI's reputation for playing fast and loose with the rights of the artists and photographers on whose works the models are trained. There are concerns that using such models to create derivative work could expose enterprises to lawsuits for breach of copyright. Nvidia hopes to allay those concerns by striking a licensing deal with stock image library Getty Images, which says it will pay royalties to artists on revenue generated by models trained on the works in its database.
 
Nvidia is working with another library, Shutterstock, to train Picasso to 
create 3D models in response to text prompts
 based on licensed images in its database. These 3D designs will be available for use in industrial 
digital twins running on Nvidia's Omniverse
 platform.
 
The third AI Foundations service, BioNeMo, deals not in words and images but in molecular structures. Researchers can use it to design new molecules and predict their behavior. Nvidia is targeting it at pharmaceutical firms for drug discovery and testing, fine-tuning it with proprietary data. It named biotechnology company Amgen as one of the first users of the service.",cio.com,1478,news,US,en,"Peter Sayer,Senior Editor",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jensen-huang-2.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,False,CIO,10.033171,fd1257b934e336ecacd703b327c06f6c,0.9999998807907104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7767634391784668

 the development of a highly scalable, on-demand AI infrastructure that is specifically designed for training large language models and creating advanced 
generative AI applications
. The collaboration aims to create the most optimized and efficient system of its kind, capable of meeting the demands of increasingly complex AI tasks.


The collaboration will make use of the most recent Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) 
P5 instances
 powered by 
NVIDIA H100
 Tensor Core GPUs as well as AWS's cutting-edge networking and scalability, which will provide up to 20 
exaFLOPS
 of compute performance for creating and training the largest deep learning models.




Accelerated computing and AI have arrived, and just in time. Accelerated computing provides step-function speed-ups while driving down cost and power as enterprises strive to do more with less. Generative AI has awakened companies to reimagine their products and business models and to be the disruptor and not the disrupted, said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.




Customers can scale up to 20,000 H100 GPUs in EC2 UltraClusters for on-demand access to supercomputer-class performance for AI thanks to P5 instances, which will be the first GPU-based instance to benefit from AWS's second-generation 
Elastic Fabric Adapter
 (EFA) networking, which offers 3,200 Gbps of low-latency, high bandwidth networking throughput.


AWS and NVIDIA have collaborated for over a decade to create AI and HPC infrastructure, resulting in the development of 
P2, P3, P3dn, and P4d(e) instances
. The latest P5 instances are the fifth generation of NVIDIA GPU-powered AWS offerings and are optimized for training complex LLMs and computer vision models for demanding generative AI applications such as speech recognition, code generation, and video/image generation.


Amazon EC2 P5
 instances are deployed in powerful hyperscale clusters called 
EC2 UltraClusters
, which consist of top-performing compute, networking, and storage resources. These clusters are among the most powerful supercomputers globally and enable customers to execute complex multi-node machine learning training and distributed HPC workloads. With petabit-scale non-blocking networking powered by AWS EFA, customers can run high-level inter-node communication applications at scale on AWS. EFA's custom OS and integration with NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA boost the performance of inter-instance communications, reducing latency and increasing bandwidth utilization. This is essential for scaling deep learning model training across hundreds of P5 nodes.


In addition, both companies have begun collaborating on future server designs to increase the scaling efficiency with subsequent-generation system designs, cooling technologies, and network scalability.

NVDA
 is the top designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the visual experience on computing platforms. Its chips are used in a variety of end markets, including PC gaming and data centers. Traditional GPU uses include professional visualization applications that require realistic rendering, including computer-aided design, video editing, and special effects. More recently, Nvidia has experienced success in focusing its GPUs in burgeoning markets such as artificial intelligence (deep learning) and self-driving vehicles. Hyperscale cloud vendors have leveraged GPUs in training neural networks for uses such as image and speech recognition, large language models like ChatGPT, and other forms of generative AI.
 
Key Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia
 

 
We believe Nvidia possesses a wide economic moat stemming from its intangible assets related to the design of graphics processing units. The company is the originator of and leader in discrete graphics, having captured the lion's share of the market from longtime rival AMD. We think the market has significant barriers to entry in the form of advanced intellectual property. Even chip leader Intel was unable to develop its own discrete GPUs, despite its vast resources, and ultimately needed to license IP from Nvidia to integrate GPUs into its PC chipsets (though more recently Intel is vying to develop its own discrete GPU). To stay at the cutting edge of GPU technology, Nvidia has a large research and development budget relative to AMD and smaller GPU suppliers, which allows it to continuously innovate and fuel a virtuous cycle for its high-margin chips.

Fair Value Estimate for Nvidia Stock
 
Our $200 fair value estimate assumes a forward adjusted price/earnings ratio of 46 times. We project revenue will increase at a 16% compound annual rate through fiscal 2028 as the company continues to diversify its revenue sources into areas of strong potential. Fiscal 2020 was challenging for Nvidia, as gaming revenue fell due to a cryptocurrency mining-related hangover and excess channel inventories, but sales grew 53% in fiscal 2021 and 61% in fiscal 2022, thanks to the acquisition of Mellanox and gaming, data center, and crypto mining strength. Nvidia experienced a similar crypto-related downturn in fiscal 2023, recording flat sales for the year, with gaming GPU weakness offset by data center strength. We expect a return to growth in fiscal 2024, with ongoing momentum in the data center segment partially offset by continued weakness in gaming.

Risk and Uncertainty
 
Nvidia has benefited from strong PC gaming momentum in recent years. However, many of the most popular games are competitive multiplayer online games that require low-end discrete GPUs for latency reasons versus high-end GPUs—like Nvidia's—for cutting-edge graphics. In addition, a shift to mobile gaming virtual reality over PC VR could curb the company's opportunities, as Nvidia's GPUs aren't formidable in smartphones. Leveraging GPUs in deep-learning applications, among other areas, mostly occurred because of a lack of better alternatives. As alternatives arise, Nvidia's recent explosive growth could be difficult to maintain. Perhaps the greatest risk, however, is the potential scarcity of experienced chip design talent in the industry.

Nvidia Bulls Say
 
The proliferation of the AI and deep-learning phenomena that rely on Nvidia's graphics chips presents the company with a massive growth opportunity.
The company has a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving market that could lead to widespread adoption of its Drive PX self-driving platform.
The increasing complexity of graphics processors provides a barrier to entry for most potential rivals, as it would be difficult to match Nvidia's large R&D budget.
 
Nvidia Bears Say
 
The AI opportunity remains nascent, and it is not a foregone conclusion that Nvidia's GPUs will dominate.
Nvidia's automotive endeavors face plenty of competition, as numerous chipmakers are targeting the market.
A large portion of sales comes from the maturing PC industry via PC gaming.

118,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition Review,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,2023-04-12 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-founders-edition,pcmag.com,"Nvidia's ""Ada Lovelace""-based GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition doesn't upend the graphics-card field, but its decent performance, fitting price, and compact size (the last, a rarity these days) make it a smart choice for serious players.","From RTX 4090 to 4080 to 4070 Ti, Nvidia's down-the-stairs rollout of its GeForce RTX 40 Series continues with the introduction of the GeForce RTX 4070. This graphics card is the most affordable entry in the RTX 40 Series so far, at just $599, but with fewer hardware resources than the preceding three cards, it also makes for some kicked-down performance. (We received one of Nvidia's RTX 4070 Founders Edition cards for testing.) The RTX 4070 is capable at running games at 4K, but it's especially proficient at gaming at 1440p, where it's able to drive refresh rates over 120 frames per second (fps) in most titles, making it a strong option for competitive gamers looking to compete on a fast high-res display. It's an excellent graphics card if you're shopping in its price range, even if it doesn't make a convincing reason to upgrade if you already have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 or similar level of card. But if this will be your jump into the market from a 20 Series or older card, this is will be a rocket.

The Design: An AD104 With the 'Ti' Snipped Off

Employed in all GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, Nvidia's new ""Ada Lovelace"" graphics architecture incorporates notable improvements over the ""Ampere"" architecture used inside the older GeForce RTX 30 Series. In addition to changes that improve overall performance with higher core counts and higher clock speeds, the Lovelace architecture also has notably improved ray-tracing performance, and the GPU is built on a more efficient 4nm manufacturing process by TSMC.

All of these changes enable RTX 40 Series graphics cards to perform better and to consume less power for the amount of performance they deliver. This is further boosted by features like DLSS 3, which so far is supported only on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards. It enables the card to boost frame rates further, with the small subset of DLSS 3-compatible games out there so far.

The GeForce RTX 4070 bears a number of similarities to its direct predecessor, the RTX 3070. Both feature 5,888 CUDA cores, 184 texture mapping units (TMUs), 184 Tensor cores, and 46 ray-tracing (RT) cores. From here, they diverge. In some ways, the RTX 3070 appears to have an advantage, as it has 96 raster operation units (ROPs) to the RTX 4070's 64, and it also has a larger 256-bit memory interface that's technically superior to the RTX 4070's 192-bit interface.

Though these differences give an impression of superiority to the RTX 3070, the RTX 4070's shortfalls in these areas are significantly overcome by other factors. Higher clock speeds on the RTX 4070's part largely compensate for the difference in ROP count, and the use of faster GDDR6 RAM on the RTX 4070 actually enables it to achieve higher bandwidth than the RTX 3070. This, along with a larger (36MB) L2 cache pool and the aforementioned architectural improvements, give the RTX 4070 a far greater advantage.

Card size could also be a big point in the RTX 4070's favor. This factor is only strictly applicable to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition card and will vary from one manufacturer's RTX 4070 card to the next. (Of course, like with other GeForce GPUs, Nvidia's card partners will release a variety of RTX 4070 cards in different sizes and designs.) At roughly 9.5 inches long, the RTX 4070 Founders Edition is far smaller than any other next-generation graphics card we've reviewed so far.

This isn't petite, exactly, but it's far smaller than the hero-sandwich-size high-end cards of the moment. It makes it easier to install in tighter cases and makes it a better option for compact systems like mini-ITX PCs. Small form-factor PCs have been ballooning in size in the last few years to accommodate the whopper-size recent high-end GPUs like the GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090. If you want a ""true"" compact PC with a next-gen graphics card, this is arguably the best option at the moment.

Other than its smaller size, the GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition looks exactly like a mini, dual-slot version of the larger RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 Founders Edition cards. Just like those other Founders Edition cards, this one has two fans set at opposite ends of the card with one exposed on each side of the card. These cards all also share the same port configuration, with one HDMI and three DisplayPort connections on the rear I/O panel and a 12VHPWR power connection on the top edge of the card. The RTX 4070 Founders Edition comes with a power adapter that has a 12VHPWR connector on one end and two eight-pin PCI Express power connections on the other for use with power supplies that lack native 12VHPWR support.

GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, the RTX 4070 may actually hold a slight advantage, at least in terms of value. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and GeForce RTX 4070 are based on the same AD104 GPU core. The RTX 4070 Ti gets the full uncut core with 7,680 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs and Tensor cores, and 60 ray-tracing cores, while both have identical bandwidth in a 192-bit memory interface.

If you do a rough comparison of the hardware resources and cost between the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070, you'd find that the RTX 4070 actually provides more relative to what you pay. The RTX 4070 Ti has an MSRP of $799, giving it roughly 9.6 CUDA cores per dollar, and the $599 RTX 4070 instead has 9.8 CUDA cores per dollar. This doesn't mean a whole lot, but it does suggest a slightly better value on the RTX 4070's part. Let's see if that holds up when we take real-world performance into consideration too.

GeForce RTX 4070 Testing: PC Test Setup

Our current GPU test bed consists of an Intel Core i9-12900K processor on an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard with a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler. The system is equipped with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM clocked at 5,600MHz and a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD. The entire system is powered by a Corsair HX1500i 1,500W 80 Plus Platinum power supply to ensure an adequate supply of power no matter which graphics card we throw in, and all tests are performed inside of Windows 11 Pro.

As it exists below the RTX 4070 Ti by design, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is not competitive with any other card in the RTX 40 Series released to date. Nor is it performance-competitive in most titles with the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT or the faster Radeon RX 7900 XTX, though you may make a value argument for the RTX 4070 against these faster cards due to its lower cost.

In terms of performance, the main competitors to the RTX 4070 are the last-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. AMD's Radeon RX 6800 XT is also a key competitor for the RTX 4070, as all of these cards come in around the RTX 4070 in terms of price.

GeForce RTX 4070: Synthetic Benchmarks

Synthetic benchmarks need to be taken with a pinch of salt, as they are not entirely representative of in-game performance. Nevertheless, these can help us to gain insight into the hardware. The performance results in Furmark would suggest that the RTX 4070 was clearly faster than all of the older RTX 30 Series, while the other results were more mixed.

LuxMark and Superposition are more-focused synthetic tests in our test lineup. LuxMark is focused on general-purpose GPU performance, attempting to gauge the compute performance of the graphics card, which can be important if you do a lot of content creation work. We use Superposition to check performance in DirectX and OpenGL for each card. How well each API is supported in whatever game you play is vitally important; at least in Superposition, most cards tend to perform better while using the DirectX 11 API.

DLSS, FSR, and Ray-Tracing Tests: The RTX 4070's Strong Point

Nvidia is placing ever greater focus on the use of AI and ray tracing technologies with each new generation of graphics cards, and this is especially evident with the RTX 40 Series. In games like F1 22 and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, which support ray tracing, the RTX 4070 performed exceptionally well for its price, and it managed to compete (at some settings) with the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and even the Radeon RX 7900 XTX flagship.

When we enabled DLSS and FSR, however, things changed depending on the conditions. In F1 22 we tested the RTX 4070's performance with DLSS 2 and DLSS 3. All other Nvidia cards were using DLSS 2 for this test. With just DLSS 2 in use, the RTX 4070 jumped from one of the fastest cards in our F1 22 chart to one of the slowest—ouch!

This could be due to optimization issues, however, as the RTX 4070 received a similar performance boost from DLSS 2 in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy as other Nvidia GPUs. Better optimization for the RTX 4070 would make sense, as Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't support DLSS 3, whereas F1 22 does.

With DLSS 3 enabled, the RTX 4070 still ended up with mixed results in F1 22. It helped enormously in F1 22 at 2,560 by 1,440 resolution, but the performance was a bit worse at 4K with DLSS 3 than with DLSS 2. This again could signal optimization issues for the RTX 4070 in the GPU's launch driver.

As for our last test chart above: We're just starting to test new cards with Cyberpunk 2077 and don't have many results yet for comparison, but we can see the difference in results between the RTX 4070's standard performance and DLSS 3 performance in this title. The frame-rate increase from enabling DLSS 3 was, if anything, far larger than expected in this title, but the result was consistent and repeatable.

GeForce RTX 4070: AAA Game Tests

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 doesn't perform quite as well in games that lack ray tracing support. The RTX 4070's performance is now clearly below the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT in all games except Far Cry 5, which shows signs of a CPU bottleneck at 1080p and 1440p. Even in Far Cry 5, however, the RTX 4070 was far slower at 4K than the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT.

Compared with cards in the older RTX 30 Series, in the test games above, the RTX 4070 is right in line with the RTX 3080, and it is clearly a step below the RTX 4070 Ti.

GeForce RTX 4070: Legacy Games

Older games were a bit more challenging for the RTX 4070, and this is likely to be an ongoing trend for other RTX 40 Series graphics cards. One of the changes Nvidia made with the RTX 40 Series, as mentioned earlier, is that it reduced the number of ROPs relative to other hardware resources.

The reasons for doing this make a lot of sense. ROPs, though still important, are less important in games that utilize ray tracing. Shifting hardware resources away from ROPs enables Nvidia to refocus those resources into other things like ray-tracing cores and shaders, enabling performance gains in other areas.

Games that don't support ray tracing, however, are just as reliant on ROPs as every game that's come before, and this is particularly evident in older titles.

All of this is not to say that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070's performance was poor in older games; it was simply worse than many competing RTX 30 Series cards. Performance is mixed relative to the AMD cards in the chart, but realistically these tests don't matter a ton.

Performance in these games is often varied based on driver support and optimization, and we test these mostly to see if the GPU being reviewed is falling below playable frame rates. The results the RTX 4070 turned in for Bioshock Infinite were fine; the results in Sleeping Dogs were acceptable but could be better. Performance in Hitman Absolution was below what we would like to see, with the RTX 4070 unable to turn in a steady 60 frames per second at 4K.

GeForce RTX 4070: System Power Consumption and Thermals

We measure the power of the test system as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt meter. The only part that changes is the graphics card between tests, which enables us to gauge the power draw of the card.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 did well here and pulled notably less power than any of the competing RTX 30 and RTX 40 Series cards. It was also better than the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and the RX 7900 XT. The lower power consumption also helped the RTX 4070 to operate at lower temperatures than most other cards, though Nvidia's dual-fan thermal solution also deserves most of the credit for the RTX 4070's exceptionally low operating temperature.

Gauging performance per watt is difficult, especially with a graphics card like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, which has highly mixed performance depending on the scenario. The RTX 4070 didn't do as well in this metric as the RTX 4070 Ti or the RTX 4080 regardless of which test scenario was used.

The RTX 4070 manages to do better in games that support ray tracing than the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT or XTX in terms of performance per watt, but this situation is reversed in games that don't support ray tracing.

Verdict: A Solid Card for the Money, If Not a Revolution

Taken as a whole, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is the least-exciting entry in the RTX 40 Series so far. That's not at all to say it's a bad card, or that it's not worth buying; just that it's not revolutionary. Instead, it actually performs about as expected. It's fairly common we see new cards perform roughly on par with the previous-generation card that's a tier above its direct predecessor.

For example, the RTX 3060 tends to be roughly comparable with the RTX 2070 in terms of performance. We sometimes see new cards exceed this, like how the exceptional RTX 3070 was faster, on average, than the RTX 2080 Ti. But more often than not, what we see is the new card performing roughly on par with the card one better than its direct predecessor.

With the RTX 4070, this is mostly what we see. In older games, it's slower than the RTX 3080. In current games that don't support ray tracing, it's roughly equal to the RTX 3080. And in games that do support ray tracing, the RTX 4070 is faster. The RTX 4070 at $599 costing $100 less than the RTX 3080 at $699 also helps it to present a better overall value.

Now that the RTX 4070 is out there, we see scant reason to buy an RTX 3070, RTX 3070 Ti, or RTX 3080, unless at a substantial discount. That said, we see little reason to upgrade from any of these cards to the RTX 4070, either, as the performance gains don't justify the cost. If you have something slower than the RTX 3070, though, this is a card to look at. If you're running something like an Nvidia GTX 10 Series card, or an RTX 20 Series card below the RTX 2080, however, this would make for a serious upgrade.

We'd also argue that the RTX 4070 is a far more compelling and attractive option than the RTX 4070 Ti, as the RTX 4070 Ti comes too close in price to the often-faster AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 (at least for now!) doesn't have much to compete with at its price point. Overall, if you're buying a new graphics card and looking to spend around $600, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 is an excellent choice.",pcmag.com,492,news,US,en,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/00ActK5RabVuZzE9kBCZtg2-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1681231384.jpg,False,@pcmag,9.859827,d6f9839a246c5938faff24d7cda6aab3,0.0,0.0,0.9999788999557495,0.9999995231628418,0.0,0.0

This paper presents a benchmark analysis of NVIDIA Jetson platforms when operating deep learning-based 3D object detection frameworks. Three-dimensional (3D) object detection could be highly beneficial for the autonomous navigation of robotic platforms, such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones. Since the function provides one-shot inference that extracts 3D positions with depth information and the heading direction of neighboring objects, robots can generate a reliable path to navigate without collision. To enable the smooth functioning of 3D object detection, several approaches have been developed to build detectors using deep learning for fast and accurate inference. In this paper, we investigate 3D object detectors and analyze their performance on the NVIDIA Jetson series that contain an onboard graphical processing unit (GPU) for deep learning computation. Since robotic platforms often require real-time control to avoid dynamic obstacles, onboard processing with a built-in computer is an emerging trend. The Jetson series satisfies such requirements with a compact board size and suitable computational performance for autonomous navigation. However, a proper benchmark that analyzes the Jetson for a computationally expensive task, such as point cloud processing, has not yet been extensively studied. In order to examine the Jetson series for such expensive tasks, we tested the performance of all commercially available boards (i.e., Nano, TX2, NX, and AGX) with state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. We also evaluated the effect of the TensorRT library to optimize a deep learning model for faster inference and lower resource utilization on the Jetson platforms. We present benchmark results in terms of three metrics, including detection accuracy, frame per second (FPS), and resource usage with power consumption. From the experiments, we observe that all Jetson boards, on average, consume over 80% of GPU resources. Moreover, TensorRT could remarkably increase inference speed (i.e., four times faster) and reduce the central processing unit (CPU) and memory consumption in half. By analyzing such metrics in detail, we establish research foundations on edge device-based 3D object detection for the efficient operation of various robotic applications.

Nowadays, Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) still captivate large interest because of multiple advantages offered in numerous domains, explicitly assisting people with motor disabilities in communicating with the surrounding environment. However, challenges of portability, instantaneous processing time, and accurate data processing remain for numerous BCI system setups. This work implements an embedded multi-tasks classifier based on motor imagery using the EEGNet network integrated into the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 card. Therefore, two strategies are developed to select the most discriminant channels. The former uses the accuracy based-classifier criterion, while the latter evaluates electrode mutual information to form discriminant channel subsets. Next, the EEGNet network is implemented to classify discriminant channel signals. Additionally, a cyclic learning algorithm is implemented at the software level to accelerate the model learning convergence and fully profit from the NJT2 hardware resources. Finally, motor imagery Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provided by HaLT's public benchmark were used, in addition to the k-fold cross-validation method. Average accuracies of 83.7% and 81.3% were achieved by classifying EEG signals per subject and motor imagery task, respectively. Each task was processed with an average latency of 48.7 ms. This framework offers an alternative for online EEG-BCI systems' requirements, dealing with short processing times and reliable classification accuracy.


 










 


Applications based on Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI) are numerous in the recent literature due to their benefits in various domains [
1
]. Typically, BCI systems use brain signals to allow effective communication between a given user and local surroundings. BCI-based electroencephalographic signals (EEG) are the most implemented because of recent advances in brain electrical functioning studies and reliable technologies [
2
,
3
]. Such EEG signals were used by Fraiwan et al. [
4
] to evaluate the subjects' enjoyment and visual interest in experiencing museum expositions. For instance, BCI-based EEG signals are used in biomedical applications for mental and cognitive disease diagnoses and rehabilitation [
5
,
6
]. Lastly, Hekmatmanesh et al. [
7
] proposed a systematic review of terrestrial and aerial Brain–Controlled Vehicles (BCVs) based on EEG, Electrooculographic (EOG), and Electromyographic (EMG) signals. Commonly, for BCI-based control systems, EEG signal patterns such as Steady-State Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) [
8
] and their variants are converted into commands to control wheelchairs, drones, prostheses, and arm robots, to cite a few.
Motor Imagery EEG signals (MI–EEG) are more interesting for EEG–BCI systems because the subject under test voluntarily generates such signals; thus, it can be used to control external applications [
9
,
10
] or for medical research [
11
,
12
]. Recent advances in developing BCIs based on MI signals focus on improving classification accuracy while reducing processing time and processing-unit computational resources [
13
,
14
]. This prevailing tendency is mainly motivated by online application requirements in robotics and specialized medicine to complete accurate and brief tasks satisfactorily [
15
]. In this sense, Huang et al. [
16
] controlled an integrated wheelchair robotic arm implementing a hybrid BCI based on EEG and EOG signals. Therefore, the robotic arm and wheelchair applications needed both high-accuracy classifications of left- and right-hand MI tasks and system portability to complete reliable actions. In another study, Al-Nuaimi et al. [
17
] implemented a controlled drone-based P300 BCI for military use, dealing with high accuracy, brief processing time, and BCI portability.
Concretely, numerous methods are used in the literature to conjointly address short processing time, reliable accuracy, and portability challenges. In this sense, channel selection -based strategies aim to process signals from a few discriminant electrodes instead of using all electrodes, reducing data size and processing algorithms' complexity and, consequently, the processing time. For example, Moctezuma et al. [
18
] proposed the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II in the emotion recognition BCI with wearable EEG systems, selecting a set of 8–10 EEG channels instead of the 32 available. In parallel, various techniques based on deep learning offer satisfactory results without EEG signal preprocessing or implementing complex learning acceleration algorithms. Such an approach reduces the processing time significantly depending on the implemented neural architectures [
19
,
20
]. Other strategies typically work on hardware-based levels using traditionally powerful processing units despite the robustness of reliable data and algorithms [
21
,
22
].
Fortunately, advances in hardware re-configurable design technology have enabled the development of embedded electronic boards with powerful computing resources [
23
]. Those embedded boards are microcomputers generally supporting complex data processing, ensuring portability and reduced signal processing time because of dedicated core resources. Meanwhile, Majoros and Oniga [
24
] implemented a MI–EEG classifier based on a deep learning architecture for BCI applications on a Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) card. Their work achieved an accuracy of 97.7%, classifying imagined tasks of opening and closing fists or feet into three classes; the neutral task was included. Further, Dabas et al. [
25
] used the Arduino Uno board to classify hand-gripping MI trials from channels C3 and C4 using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier.
On the other hand, deep learning architectures have proven to have high performance as EEG signal classifiers in recent works, especially the compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCI (EEGNet) and its variants proposed by Lawhern et al. [
26
]. In this sense, Zhu et al. [
27
] developed an ensemble learning coupled to the EEGNet network to improve the ear-EEG signals' classification for SSVEP-based BCI, achieving an accuracy of 81.74%. Lastly, Feng et al. [
28
] implemented a real-time EEGNet classifier on an FPGA board, using only 2.54% of the board's resources and consuming 3.66% of the maximum power available. Similarly, Tsukahara et al. [
29
] achieved an accuracy of 88.75%, implementing the EEGNet architecture on a Virtex-7 FPGA platform to classify EEG data from the MNE dataset.
This work develops an embedded MI tasks classifier for BCI systems based on the EEGNet network by using the NJT2 board. The framework develops a subject-dependent classification approach, where data from each subject are processed separately. Therefore, the MI movements to be classified are the tongue, passive, left and right hands, and left and right legs. In the first step, the Accuracy Rating-based Classifier method (ARbC) and Channels Mutual -based Approach (CMIbA) are developed to make up discriminant channel subsets. Next, MI signals from discriminant channels are processed to be classified into the six aforementioned classes using the EEGNet network.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows,
Results comparison of channel selection between the ARbC method and CMIbA.
Reliable accuracy results of the tongue, passive, left and right hands, and left and right legs MI tasks classification.
Processing time reduction using the NJT2 platform resources.
Convergence acceleration of the learning process implementing the Cyclic Learning Rate (CLR) algorithm.
In sum, this work deals with processing time reduction and reliable classification accuracy for embedded EEG BCI-based applications.
In the recent literature on embedded BCIs (EBCI) based on MI–EEG signals, numerous works dealing with brief processing time and high classification accuracy have been proposed [
30
,
31
]. Embedded platform-based BCI designs aim to build low-cost and low-power consumption systems, meeting user adaptability and dedicating available resources to application-specific functions. Belwafi et al. [
23
] proposed a review of EBCI systems focusing on pathological disorders, functional substitution, and most implemented architectures. Despite recent advances in embedding computational architectures design, they reported a few of the EBCI systems presented in the related literature.
Generally, the central processing unit of the EBCI is ported by a microprocessor or microcontroller integrated into FPGA cards, Arduino boards, Nvidia's developer cards, or specifically dedicated platforms. In this sense, Ma et al. [
32
] implemented a classifier-based convolutional neural network into a Xilinx FPGA platform to classify MI–EEG signals. Comparatively, implementing the same model on a portable computer equipped with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX1070 i7-7700 resources, the configured FPGA was revealed to be eight times faster than the PC, achieving an average classification accuracy of over 80%. Lately, EBCI systems-based EEG classifiers have been implemented into the NJT2 board, taking advantage of the NVIDIA
®
 Jetson™ board deployment [
33
]. In fact, Khatwani et al. [
34
] implemented a convolutional neural network model into Artix-7 FPGA and NJT2 platforms to detect artifacts carried in EEG signals of multiple channels. Based on the basic ICA algorithm, their method achieved an average accuracy of 74 %, detecting seven different artifact types using 64 EEG channels. In another recent framework [
35
], convolutional stacked auto-encoder and convolutional long short-term memory models were proposed to classify MI–EEG signals for drone control using the NJT2 board. A latency time of 10 ms was reported for generating drone navigation commands based on left-hand and right-hand imagined movement. Similarly, Ascari et al. [
36
] implemented a networked nodes modular architecture hosted on the NJT2 platform for outdoor portability. The average accuracy of 50% was achieved based on the subject-specific classification processing EEG signals from Cz, Pz, and {Cz, Pz} channels with an average offset between streams of 0 




±




0




 ms.
On the other hand, the EEGNet has been implemented more frequently on FPGA boards than on other platforms for EBCI-based EEG signals in the recent literature [
37
]. Moreover, Hernandez-Ruiz et al. [
38
] implemented an EEGNet-based architecture into an FPGA board to classify MI–EEG signals, achieving accuracies of 83.15%, 75.74%, and 65.75% for the defined tasks. Lately, Enériz et al. [
39
] utilized the Xilinx Zynq FPGA to set up a real-time EEGNet-based BCI. 
Table 1
 summarizes the recent state-of-the-art focused on related works.
Finally, regarding the recent literature based on HaLT's dataset [
40
], Yan et al. [
41
] used the referred public dataset to improve classification accuracy by designing an attention mechanism and global features aggregation based on deep learning. They reported an average accuracy of 76.7% for classifying EEG signals of twelve subjects with the EEGNet network. In another work, Keerthi Krishnan and Soman [
42
] proposed a variational mode-decomposed EEG-spectrum image model for MI classification using the dataset provided by [
40
]. Their work achieved an average accuracy of 90.2 ± 4.34% with the EEGNet network converting EEG signals from C3, Cz, and C4 channels into spectrum images by using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Likewise, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was proposed by An et al. [
43
] to denoise MI-EEG signals using the same dataset. Lately, the EEGNet network has been implemented to classify MI–EEG signal-based BCI utilizing HaLT's benchmark [
44
]. An average classification accuracy of 80.9 ± 8.6% was achieved by classifying EEG signals from eight channels. In sum, taking advantage of more than five BCI interaction paradigms, Kaya's dataset offers a wide range of BCI implementation possibilities to the related literature. 
Table 2
 presents Kaya's experiment's data organization related to six mental imagery tasks. The referred BCI interaction paradigm contemplates 6 MI tasks executed by 12 subjects, each with a determined number of sessions.
The method developed in this work addresses the practical challenge of multi-class classification and expedited processing of EEG signals on dedicated platforms using the NJT2 development board and the artificial neural network EEGNet. All developed processing algorithms are integrated directly into the NJT2 embedded platform to exploit hardware resources.
Figure 1
 presents the high-level general diagram of the proposed method. Two main steps are developed to process MI–EEG signals. The first one aims to select discriminant channels employing two approaches (ARbC and CMIbA), while the second implements the EEGNet network to classify discriminant channel features. The ARbC approach also utilizes the EEGNet architecture but with parameters adapted to single-channel signals.
The dataset published in [
40
] was used to implement the proposed method. Explicitly, this work used EEG data provided by the BCI interaction paradigm related to six mental imagery states.

Acer has introduced the Predator Triton 17 X, one of many laptops that it has announced today. As its name suggests, the Predator Triton 17 X is a high-end unit that Acer hopes will interest creators and gamers. Specifically, the Predator Triton 17 X relies on the 
Intel Core i9-13900HX
, a Raptor Lake-based processor with 24 cores, 32 threads and a 5.4 GHz peak clock speed.
While the 
Core i9-13900HX
 offers exceptional CPU performance, its 
UHD Graphics 770
 iGPU is not powerful enough for modern triple-A games. To that end, Acer has also equipped the Predator Triton 17 X with an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
, an AD103-based graphics card with 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM at its disposal. Additionally, the Predator Triton 17 X has 64 GB DDR5-5600 RAM and 4 TB of storage arranged in RAID 0.
Moreover, Acer equips the Predator Triton 17 X with a 17-inch display that outputs at 2,560 x 1,600 pixels in a 16:10 aspect ratio. According to Acer, the panel operates at up to 250 Hz and delivers 1,000 nits peak brightness thanks to the use of Mini-LED backlights. All these powerful components sit within a CNC-milled unibody housing, as our photos and YouTube Shorts video below show. Acer will start selling the Predator Triton 17 X (PTX17-71) from June, starting at €4,299.

Colorful, Inno3D, Gainward, Palit and Zotac have revealed their small form-factor RTX 4060 GPUs. The cards are at most 17 cm in length and occupy only two slots, making them ideal for mini-ITX HTPC / 1080p gaming builds.

Nvidia's AIB partners really went overkill with the cooling systems for the high-end RTX 4000 cards. The PCB of an 
RTX 4090
 / 
4080
 card measures ~50% of the cooling system length, and most cards keep the GPU under 70 C in most stressful situations. However, 
slim waterblocks
 cool these cards just fine so the chonky coolers do not really make much sense, but, as always, custom solutions come at a high premium. Even the 
RTX 4070
 cards could easily be cooled by shorter solutions, yet AIBs apparently have no intention of releasing small form-factor cards for the more powerful Ada GPUs. Instead, the mini-ITX versions end up being relegated to the lower mid-range 
RTX 4060 / Ti
 SKUs. Thankfully, quite a few AIBs are planning to launch mini-ITX solutions this year, not just MSI, so there is room for competitive price points.


Surprisingly enough, MSI has not yet announced any mini-ITX RTX 4060 cards, nor has Asus and Gigabyte. Most likely the announcements are happening at Computex in a few weeks. Meanwhile Zotac, Inno3D, Palit, Gainward and Colorful are rushing their mini-ITX cards, some with incomplete spec sheets. All the mini-ITX solutions appear to be dual-slot and feature a single fan.


Zotac
, for instance, only revealed product pictures for its RTX 4060 Solo card, without any other specs. 
Inno3D
's RTX 4060 Compact appears to be the shortest card at 155 x 122 x 39 mm and features 1830 MHz base / 2460 MHz boost clocks for the GPU plus an 8-pin connector. 
Colorful
 is also launching a non-Ti RTX 4060 SFF card called 'Mini-V' with 17 cm length. All the non-Ti cards come with 8 GB VRAM.


On the other hand, 
Gainward
 and 
Palit
 are launching RTX 4060 Ti mini-ITX cards. These two appear to have similar cooling shrouds and both are under 17 cm in length, with 160 W TDP, and either a 2670 MHz GPU overclock or the Nvidia stock clocks plus 8 GB of VRAM.


If previous gen mini-ITX solutions are any indication, the smaller RTX 4060 models could come with a slightly increased price over the full-length versions, since AIBs tend to limit the SFF card production.

 has shared more details about the forthcoming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, building on information it revealed 
earlier this week
. As expected, NVIDIA will offer the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti in 8 GB and 16 GB VRAM variants, both with 22 TFLOPs of theoretical performance (FP32). In comparison, the 
RTX 2060 SUPER
 and 
RTX 3060 Ti
 delivered 7 TFLOPs and 16 TFLOPs, respectively.
Contrary to earlier rumours, the 16 GB version of the RTX 4060 Ti will not feature a higher TGP than its 8 GB sibling. Instead, both graphics cards will peak at 160 W, 40 W lower than the 
RTX 3060 Ti
. Additionally, all RTX 4060 Ti variants will rely on GDDR6 VRAM operating on a 128-bit bus at 18 Gbps. Hence, the RTX 4060 Ti will deliver 288 GB/s memory bandwidth.
The RTX 4060 Ti series will start on May 24 with its 8 GB VRAM variant. By contrast, the 16 GB version is not tipped to arrive until July, possibly alongside the 
RTX 4060
. As the slide below shows, NVIDIA will launch the RTX 4060 Ti for US$399 with 8 GB of VRAM, US$200 less than the RTX 4070 and US$400 less than the RTX 4070 Ti. In comparison, the 16 GB variant will be available for US$499, equidistant between the cheaper RTX 4060 Ti and the more performant 
RTX 4070
.

134,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition Review,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,2023-05-23 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-founders-edition,pcmag.com,"Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is exceptional for gaming at 1080p, but it's limited at higher resolutions by its cut-back bandwidth, making this graphics card a tougher sell for anything more demanding.","Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards have hit the scene and, at each step down the stack, delivered a large performance boost over their equivalent previous-generation cards. This upward curve has been driven by several factors. In particular, though, Nvidia's new DLSS 3 technology and improved ray-tracing hardware have helped the RTX 40 Series feel like a considerable leap forward.

To date, these benefits have been locked to the high end of the market, but that changes with the launch of Nvidia's upper-midrange GeForce RTX 4060 Ti ($399). You can't classify any of the RTX 40 Series launched so far as ""cheap,"" and while this graphics card's price is still far from budget-friendly, its upgrades over Nvidia's RTX 30 Series parts make it a fine choice for a midrange gaming PC, especially for high-frame-rate play at 1080p.

Nvidia AD106: More Cores for Your Buck

The AD106 GPU core resides at the heart of all Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics cards. The AD106 die, based on Nvidia's ""Ada Lovelace"" microarchitecture (which I detail in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 review), is packed with a high core count of 4,608 CUDA cores, 4,352 of which are active on the RTX 4060 Ti.

This gives the RTX 4060 Ti narrowly more than half as many cores as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, which coincidentally costs twice as much, at $799. The RTX 4060 Ti comes in closer, price-wise, to the non-Ti Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, which has 5,888 cores, or roughly 35% more than the RTX 4060 Ti. In contrast, the RTX 4070 is priced at $599—just 50% more than the RTX 4060 Ti.

Sorry for throwing so many numbers at you from the start; beginning here helps to set the stage and to understand how the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti fits in with the existing graphics cards market. Though core counts are certainly not everything and you'll find far more that affects performance, cores are nevertheless the workhorses of the GPU, and the more the merrier.

Prices on everything GPU have been shifting in the last few years, and to some extent that forces us to reconsider how we think about graphics cards in terms of pricing. A few years back, I never would have considered a $399 graphics card as a midrange solution, but that now seems to be where the market is at. That may be hard to swallow, but it helps somewhat to recognize that while $399 may not be quite as wallet-friendly as many would like, the RTX 4060 Ti does provide more cores per dollar than any other RTX 40 Series card released so far.

Whether this will translate into the best performance per dollar is a question I'll answer in the course of revealing the test results. But first, let's go over the RTX 4060 Ti and our test sample, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition.

Nvidia ships the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti with a relatively limited memory interface: four 32-bit memory controllers for an aggregate 128-bit memory interface. This is a major step down from the RTX 4060 Ti's direct predecessor, the RTX 3060 Ti, which had a 256-bit interface. This results in the RTX 4060 Ti having far less overall bandwidth than its predecessor, with just 288GBps of bandwidth compared with the RTX 3060 Ti's 448GBps.

At first, this looks like a serious blow and would normally suggest that the RTX 4060 Ti would be slower than its predecessor. But Nvidia made some changes that helped to offset the loss in bandwidth (though these tweaks did not mitigate it entirely). In particular, the pool of L2 cache on the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti was greatly expanded relative to the RTX 3060 Ti. In total, the RTX 4060 Ti has 32MB of L2 cache, which absolutely dwarfs the RTX 3060 Ti's 4MB of L2 cache. Nvidia also reportedly improved the bandwidth among the GPU cores, and the L2 cache as well, to further boost performance.

Overall, this has helped avoid a big performance hit from the major reduction in memory bandwidth, but it's not a perfect solution. As memory usage increases, which happens when you raise the resolution or enable some memory-intensive graphics features, bandwidth demands also increase, and the more the GPU will be forced to wait for data to be fetched from the RAM. Predicting exactly how this will play out in every individual PC game isn't possible, as you'll encounter too many variables. However, in some games, this design will likely see performance drop more precipitously on the RTX 4060 Ti, in a relative sense, as the resolution increases than it does with other cards.

I'll leave the rest of the important details like clock speeds to the spec chart above—and move on to looking over our test sample. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition carries stock clock speeds with a dual-slot, dual-fan thermal solution. The cooler is essentially the same as those used on the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, only a fair deal smaller. It's nearly identical to the cooler on the RTX 4070 Founders Edition, with both cards looking the very same in both size and aesthetics.

Given our experience with Nvidia's Founders Edition cards so far, it comes as no surprise that this thermal solution is able to keep the RTX 4060 Ti cool with ease while remaining relatively quiet. The RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition has the standard set of three DisplayPort connections and one HDMI port on its rear I/O panel. Like the other RTX 40 Series cards, the Founders Edition requires a 12VHPWR power connection, and it ships with an adapter to make this less troublesome.

This particular model is equipped with 8GB of GDDR6 memory; it also weighs 2.25 pounds and measures 9.6 by 3.9 inches. Nvidia intends to sell a model in July that costs $100 more with 16GB of GDDR6. Given the limited bandwidth, a GDDR6X option would be welcome, but I don't currently see any signs that one is coming.

Testing the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti: Our Setup, and the Competition

All tests on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti were performed using our 2022 GPU testbed. This system was built around an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard with an Intel Core i9-12900K processor that is actively cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X(Opens in a new window) water cooler. The processor is operated at stock clocks, but the system uses a Corsair Vengeance RAM 32GB(Opens in a new window) memory kit that's clocked at 5,600MHz.

A 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro(Opens in a new window) NVMe 4.0 SSD is the main storage for this PC, with a Corsair HX1500i(Opens in a new window) 1,500-watt 80 Plus Platinum power supply providing power for the system. All tests are performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with the latest Windows updates installed.

As a midrange graphics card, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is up against a lot of competition. Not only does it need to reliably beat out the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti, but it also needs to stand toe-to-toe with AMD's last-gen Radeon RX 6000 cards—notably, the Radeon RX 6700 XT, which is available for under $400. Matching these cards alone would only make the RTX 4060 Ti an 'okay' option, though. It will need to soundly beat them to stand out.

Synthetic Tests

Synthetic benchmarks help to show a graphics card's potential, but they may not accurately represent real-world performance. The RTX 4060 Ti's 3DMark performance would suggest it was roughly on par with the last-gen RTX 3070 and significantly faster than the RTX 3060. That's probably the best we are going to get from synthetic tests, as Furmark showed the RTX 4060 Ti to be markedly faster than the RTX 3070, but Superposition showed the RTX 3070 to be the faster of the two.

LuxMark also suggests that the RTX 3070 is faster, or at least that it is when it comes to raw compute performance for GPGPU applications.

Ray Tracing, FSR, and DLSS Testing

Given that the RTX 4060 Ti is a member of the RTX 40 Series of graphics cards, ray tracing is something of a specialty for this card. It also supports DLSS 3, which gives us some interesting results to talk over.

Starting with F1 22, we can see the RTX 4060 Ti started out well enough by soundly surpassing the RTX 3060 and RTX 3070 at 1080p and 1440p resolutions. At 4K, however, that memory issue I mentioned that might come up, indeed came up. Cards with more bandwidth can handle the move to 4K with more grace, but cards like the RTX 4060 Ti see a greater performance penalty for switching to 4K. It dropped from cleanly ahead of the RTX 3070 to just a smidge behind it. We saw much the same outcome when comparing the RTX 4060 Ti with the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT.

Enabling FSR 1.0 and DLSS 2.0 shook up the test results a bit: The RTX 4060 Ti fell behind the AMD Radeon RX 6800 and Radeon RX 6800 XT. The RTX 3070 also benefited more from this transition than the RTX 4060 Ti, with the two in a dead-even tie. The older RTX 30 Series cards don't support DLSS 3, however, and, when this technology was enabled, the RTX 4060 Ti's 1440p performance climbed past all of those other cards using just DLSS 2.

The RTX 4060 Ti's 4K performance dropped when I enabled DLSS 3, though. It's too much detail to go over how DLSS 3 works here; if you're interested in that, see our aforementioned GeForce RTX 4090 review for more details. Regardless, one key thing we need to go over here about DLSS 3 is that it increases the workload on the graphics card without stressing the CPU.

In a perfect PC, the graphics card would be able to operate at its peak potential at all times without being held back by other components. This often does not happen, though, as the GPU at times must wait on the CPU to do work and on data to be loaded from storage devices, RAM, and over the various interconnections of the PC. DLSS 3 is a brilliant technique that aims to put a graphics card's unused potential to use by generating new frames from data the GPU already has at hand.

Situationally, this helps to get around bottlenecks in the system to achieve more frames per second, but it only really works if the GPU has untapped power to spare. Explaining this was essential, as it illustrates exactly what we see with the RTX 4060 Ti. At 4K with maxed-out graphics settings, the GPU simply doesn't have the extra horsepower sitting idle to use for generating frames, and attempting to do so actually hurts performance as it increases the workload even more.

Then there's NIS. In Returnal, I tested the RTX 4060 Ti out with Nvidia's NIS technology as well as with DLSS 2, with DLSS 3, and with none of these technologies active. The card achieved the best performance with Nvidia's NIS technology, but this came at a cost. Nvidia's NIS technology (""Nvidia Image Scaling"") is yet another technology that works to improve frame rates by rendering a game at lower resolution and then upscaling the resulting images to your target resolution. In other words, if you set your resolution to 3,840 by 2,160 and enable NIS, the game, depending on how its configured, might render instead at 2,560 by 1,440 and then upscale the frames back to 3,840 by 2,160 before they are sent to the monitor. This is how DLSS 1, DLSS 2, FSR, XeSS, and NIS all work on a basic level. Unlike DLSS, NIS does not run on the Tensor cores inside of Nvidia's graphics cards, and it has lower overall image fidelity, which makes using it a bit of a trade-off.

Performance with DLSS 2 wasn't significantly worse than using NIS, but DLSS 3 hurt performance considerably in this game. The clear implication here is that you can certainly try using DLSS 3 on the RTX 4060 Ti, but you'll want to make sure it isn't hurting performance instead of helping. At 1080p, it would likely help considerably more, but we consider DLSS an option more for gaming at higher resolutions and don't regularly test it at 1080p.

The results from Cyberpunk 2077 are all over the place. It performed reasonably well without DLSS enabled, and it put up a decent fight against the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, a much costlier graphics card. It got absolutely destroyed by the RTX 4070, though, which has more muscle to spare for DLSS 3 frame generation.

Guardians of the Galaxy, this time around, didn't tell us much, with the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 3070 fairly close to each other across the board.

AAA Titles Without Ray Tracing

In games that don't support ray tracing, the RTX 4060 Ti loses one of its best advantages. This resulted in its performance falling back some, which allowed the RTX 3070 to take a small lead over the RTX 4060 Ti in Total War: Three Kingdoms and in Far Cry 5.

Performance at 4K was notably better on the RTX 3070 in Red Dead Redemption 2 (and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, as well), but the RTX 4060 Ti pulled ahead in these titles at 1080p, and the two closed to a tie at 1440p.

Against the AMD competition, the RTX 4060 Ti definitively defeated AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT in Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The two were in a dead heat on Red Dead Redemption 2, though, and Far Cry 5 in general favored the Radeon RX 6700 XT at higher resolutions.

Legacy Game Tests

When it comes to legacy titles, performance often comes down more to how well-optimized drivers are for a particular card in a particular game or with a particular graphics API. Nvidia's RTX 40 Series cards haven't been faring as well here as the older RTX 30 Series in these tests. But, for the most part, everything is still playable. No question this time around, though: The RTX 3070 is faster.

135,Nvidia's blowout forecast sparks $260-billion AI rally,Jeran Wittenstein,2023-05-25 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com/business/2023/05/25/nvidias-blowout-forecast-sparks-260-billion-ai-rally.html,thestar.com,"The tech company gained as much as 29 per cent in premarket trading, on course for a record high, after saying it expects about $11 billion of sales in the three months ending July","Nvidia Corp.'s forecast for surging revenue surprised even the most bullish analysts on Wall Street, propelling the chipmaker to the cusp of a $1-trillion market capitalization and igniting a global jump in stocks linked to artificial intelligence.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company gained as much as 29 per cent in premarket trading, on course for a record high, after saying it expects about $11 billion of sales in the three months ending July. Analysts had estimated that figure was going to be roughly $7.2 billion.

Nvidia, the biggest maker of the advanced chips required to train a new generation of AI services, added to expectations for a burgeoning technology. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. jumped 10 per cent, while suppliers from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to Advantest Corp. also climbed. Along with memory chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. and Europe's ASML Holding NV, ASM International NV, BE Semiconductor Industries NV, VAT Group AG and Soitec, they collectively added more than $260 billion of value in a market otherwise preoccupied with concerns about the US debt limit and China's economic slowdown.

'We believe this is just the beginning of a paradigm-altering generative AI wave,' Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a note. 'So far, it seems that Nvidia is the one capturing nearly all the economics.'

Investors this year have doubled down on wagers that the viral success of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other bots will usher in a new era of spending on the technology that underpins AI. Nvidia's chips excel at parallel processing, making them well suited for training software by bombarding it with data.

The market exuberance drove home growing anticipation around the advent of next-generation AI, which executives around the world have variously likened to the emergence of the internet and the iPhone. ChatGPT's viral debut in November touched off a global race to develop similar services that can generate content — everything from poems to algorithms and pictures — with a few user prompts.

While the jury is out on which AI service will eventually end up on top, many investors are betting that a splurge on research will drive the companies that provide components essential to AI development and hosting.

TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, rose as much as 3.8 per cent in Taipei. Equipment supplier Advantest surged as much as 20 per cent to an all-time high in Tokyo, while Hynix advanced up to 6.8 per cent in Seoul.

In Europe, semiconductor equipment maker ASML jumped 5 per cent, while BE Semiconductor Industries nearly 8 per cent.

Under chief executive officer and co-founder Jensen Huang, Nvidia has positioned itself as the top provider of components for training AI software. That's helped it weather a broader slowdown in technology spending.

Investors were looking to the company for evidence that the surge in interest in AI this year is resulting in higher sales of chips that provide the computing power. The semiconductor maker delivered that with a revenue forecast for the current quarter that dwarfed the average analyst estimate.

'The transformational surge in AI spending is paying off much earlier than expected,' Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote in a note. 'We simply have no historical precedent for the magnitude of this step function.'

Nvidia's Huang argued that the use of the technology is only in its infancy and more tailored products for specific industries are needed. He's built online services and software tools to help encourage the broader adoption of AI outside of his big customers — cloud providers like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.'s AWS.

Orders for Nvidia's A100 and H100 AI chips are 'truly spectacular,' said Amir Anvarzadeh, a strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Ltd. in Singapore. 'More importantly for Asian equity investors, they point out that all the orders are being passed on to TSMC,' which has 'more than adequate' capacity to fill the orders.

This collaborative effort aims to deliver fully standard compliant bitstreams with the lowest possible bit rate for a given perceptual quality, setting new benchmark in quality driven encoding.
 
The integration of CABR with NVENC, utilizing the Iterative Encoding, Recon, and External look ahead features, enables a range of powerful use cases, unlocking new use cases offering significant benefits for video encoding. These use cases include reducing bitrate of a target encode while preserving quality, as well as codec modernization.
 
'Codec modernization is a particularly promising use case, enabling fully automatic, quality guaranteed upgrade to modern codecs, while preserving the quality of the previous video stream. This is achieved by invoking the CABR-NVENC optimization process without specifying a bit rate value. In this scenario, the algorithm produces compressed videos with perceptually identical quality to the original, achieving up to 50% compression gain. This flow allows seamless transcoding between different video codecs, making upgrades of video repositories to newer, more efficient coding standards easy and seamless. This is a powerful enabler for accelerating the adoption of new emerging standards such as AV1', said Sharon Carmel, Founder and CEO of Beamr.
 
The extent of bit rate savings achieved by CABR vary based on file content and scene complexity, with typical averages ranging between 30% and 40%. These substantial savings in bit rate requirements reduce storage needs and are expected to result in significant cost reductions, particularly in scenarios where millions of streams need to be stored in high quality. Additionally, CABR's intelligent optimizations make a significant impact in user-generated content (UGC) on smartphones, where conservative bit rates are used to ensure quality.
 
Furthermore, the integration of CABR-NVENC leads to lower Content Delivery Network (CDN) costs by minimizing bandwidth requirements. These enhancements translate to efficient video delivery and improved streaming experiences.
 
Previously, CABR was suited to offline processing, but now, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, CABR-NVENC operates in real time, enhancing its application for optimizing live video creation services. This breakthrough technology empowers content creators and streaming platforms to achieve superior video compression and delivery performance while maintaining exceptional visual quality.
 
The release of the Video Codec marks a significant step in video compression innovation, offering industry-leading solutions that are designed to redefine the boundaries of efficiency and quality enabling significant advancements in video streaming, storage, and distribution.

VideoCardz
 has now leaked Radeon RX 7600 pricing for Europe and the US. Allegedly, AMD shared the pricing of its upcoming mid-range graphics card yesterday, which 
VideoCardz
 has subsequently confirmed with several 'press and influencers'. Perhaps unsurprisingly, AMD has decided to offer the Radeon RX 7600 for less than the 
GeForce RTX 4060
, which NVIDIA announced last week for US$299. For context, NVIDIA has priced the 8 GB and 16 GB versions of the 
GeForce RTX 4060 Ti
 for US$399 and US$499 too, respectively.
In comparison, AMD will release the Radeon RX 7600 for US$269 and €299 in Europe. Thus, not only will AMD undercut NVIDIA but it will also undercut the 
Radeon RX 6600
, which arrived for US$329 and €339. The Radeon RX 7600 will retain the 32 Compute Unit (CU) count of the 
RX 6600 XT
 and 
RX 6650 XT
. However, AMD has based its RX 7000 series graphics card on its new RDNA 3 architecture, contained within a Navi 33 XL GPU that has 2,048 Stream Processors with 2.25 GHz game and 2.62 GHz boost clocks.
Additionally, the Radeon RX 7600 has 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM operating on a 128-bit memory bus at 18 Gbps for a 288 GB/s memory bandwidth. The graphics card will also have a 165 W TGP, 33 W higher than its predecessor. AMD will formally launch the Radeon RX 7600 on May 25, just over a year after it debuted the 
RX 6650 XT
. Reviews for early Radeon RX 7600 cards should start arriving tomorrow.

Path tracing is significantly more taxing even on high-end RTX 4000 GPUs compared to traditional ray tracing methods. Nvidia's real-time neural radiance caching for path tracing is designed to solve the severe performance hit. This new AI-accelerated method has been in development for a couple of years now and the first implementation could soon be featured in the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion Phantom Liberty.

Leaks / Rumors






Nvidia's Tensor cores that act as a small-scale neural network are seeing quite a few use cases these days with the advent of generative AI. Besides offering decent performance for local implementations of
 text-to-image
 and, more recently, 
text-to-video
 solutions, Tensor cores have proven their proficiency with real-time high-quality image upscale models like 
DLSS and frame generation
. But there are other ways to utilize Tensor cores in games. One such use case was demonstrated two years ago by Nvidia in a research paper detailing a real-time neural radiance caching for path tracing (NRC), which essentially provides a less taxing and more precise way of showing ray traced reflections in games. According to CapFrameX, the NRC method is rumored to soon be implemented for Cyberpunk 2077 with the upcoming 
Phantom Liberty DLC
 releasing this June.


Cyberpunk 2077 already supports path tracing
 with the latest update. However, this feature drastically reduces performance on any of the 
RTX 30
 or

 cards. Thankfully, DLSS can help regain some of the lost fps. CD Project Red seems to be turning Cyberpunk 2077 into an Nvidia tech showcase, as the company now allegedly plans to improve the path tracing quality even further with the introduction of the neural radiance caching method.


In the 2021 research paper, Nvidia explains that NRC is optimized for fully dynamic scenes, yet it does not rely on pre-training and inference techniques to generalize surface light bounce. Instead, NRC is achieving generalization via adaptation, training the model in real-time as the rendering occurs. This self-training technique is similar to the older radiosity algorithms. While this can efficiently boost fps counts and visual fidelity, as well as free up VRAM, there is a slight downside, nonetheless. Each frame would see a 2.6 ms render time increase for FHD resolution, possibly more than 3 ms for 4K. Presumably this can still be combined with frame generation.

AI chatbots may pen your company's next advertising jingle.

WPP, one of the world's most dominant advertising agencies, is teaming up with chip-maker Nvidia to employ generative AI to create advertising campaigns. Hey robots, here's some sage advice from our favorite (and tragically human) ad masters, Don Draper: Make it simple, but significant.

Mad LLMs

It's a partnership years in the making, Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's VP of Omniverse and simulation technology, told the Financial Times over the holiday weekend. The two firms have long been at work perfecting a new platform that will use 3D imaging software to create hyper-realistic images, both video and photo, to create countless versions of the same ad in just a few clicks.

For WPP and its scores of clients, that means cutting lots and lots of costs:

""We are able to use generative AI to now personalize and . . . customize [advertising] to every environment in the world: you can create 10,000 versions within a couple of minutes,"" WPP's chief technology officer, Steph Pretorius, told the FT.
In one example noted by the FT, that could mean using generative AI to create an ad featuring a car rolling into Times Square to market to customers in one corner of the world, and a similar ad featuring the same car driving through Hong Kong to show to customers in a different corner of the world.

On the Chopping Block: The cut costs, obviously, will come in the form of labor -- while it may take a human production crew a few days to film an ad, it could take generative AI just a few minutes to create a digital Frankenstein version. ""It's much easier to identify the jobs that AI will disrupt than it is to identify the jobs that AI will create,"" WPP CEO Mark Read told the FT. ""We've applied AI a lot to our media business, but very little to the creative parts of our business."" Yeah, but could a bot create Apple's 1984 Super Bowl ad? Or Mr. Clean ... OK, we'll stay open-minded.

147,Morgan Stanley: This stock provides a cheaper way to play Nvidia's A.I. boom,Weizhen Tan,2023-06-02 00:00:44,date,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/02/this-stocks-a-key-beneficiary-of-nvda-ai-opportunity-morgan-stanley.html,cnbc.com,"Morgan Stanley says one global stock is a ""key beneficiary of NVDA's AI opportunity.""","Artificial intelligence is gaining in popularity, but there's a ""cheaper"" way to play it, according to Morgan Stanley. The bank highlighted the DRAM business in semiconductors. It stands for dynamic random access memory — a type of semiconductor memory typically needed by a computer processor to function. ""Memory is a cheaper way to play the start of AI's explosive new decade-long growth phase,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a May 29 note. ""We put the spotlight on Hynix's market-leading HBM DRAM business, uniquely positioned to capitalize on AI computing needs,"" they said, referring to South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix . The bank said SK Hynix is a ""key beneficiary of NVDA's AI opportunity."" Nvidia shares surged last week after it reported earnings that blew past expectations, and investors bought into the stock on the AI buzz. ""We have started to see the impact of AI in memory, as NVIDIA (NVDA.O) provided statistical evidence that supports our investment thesis – it has pulled forward the substance of the AI theme and raised the bar on DRAM revenue growth,"" said Morgan Stanley. Memory with high performance and bandwidth is used in Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and are ""driving significant new demand growth for memory … for the AI server system,"" the bank said. GPUs underpin most generative AI tools. For SK Hynix, that demand growth will account for 25% of its DRAM revenue exposure by the fourth quarter this year, going by Morgan Stanley's estimates. The bank maintained its overweight rating on SK Hynix and raised its price target for the stock from 110,000 Korean won ($83) to 140,000 Korean won. That represents potential upside of about 29%. BofA in a separate June 1 report also named SK Hynix as a top pick, saying it will benefit from Nvidia's push into AI. ""SK Hynix is the only chipmaker that supplies HBM3 to NVIDIA, to our knowledge,"" said BofA, referring to the high bandwidth memory. ""We also believe HBM offers lower cyclical risk and new growth opportunities due to its high margin profile and strong demand (from NVIDIA, etc)."" It gave SK Hynix a price target of 160,000 won, or upside of more than 40%. The 'AI-driven memory rally is real' Morgan Stanley estimates that global AI revenue will reach $180 billion this year and grow to nearly $2 trillion by 2030 — and it will be a key driver of semiconductor revenue. ""Memory is the 'workhorse' for AI servers,"" the bank said. ""The adoption of AI server usage increases demand for all types of memory and could cause memory to become a future bottleneck as AI eats massive amounts of data to support its needs."" It said that the ""AI-driven memory rally is real"" and is likely to continue for some time. ""While at a certain point the market will see some froth and bubbles, the potential for AI and the earnings power that it will provide is undeniable,"" the analysts wrote. Stocks are ""materially cheaper"" now than in the previous cycle, Morgan Stanley said. ""The market is still underestimating the impact of AI on memory, in our view, given that we are still early in a journey that will take decades,"" the bank said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",cnbc.com,128,news,US,en,Weizhen Tan,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106850447-1615188713249-gettyimages-1229309032-jung-sedex202201027_npLrD.jpeg?v=1685664044&w=1920&h=1080,False,,8.444847,69ad5816b4090edd5f89d32347abe652,0.9968558549880981,0.0,0.0,0.9999936819076538,0.0,0.0

Nvidia's new ""superchip,"" named after the legendary female computer scientist and rear admiral, will appear just as intimidating to the chip company's various rivals, and mainly Intel, the dominant supplier of central processing units (CPU) for data centers and related sectors. Grace Hopper is arguably the most serious threat Intel has faced so far.

Launched the week after Nvidia's share price climbed 24% in one day, amid excitement about the implications of an AI boom for Nvidia, Grace Hopper unites CPU and graphical processing unit (GPU) technology in a single product. GPUs, Nvidia's speciality, have turned out to be much better than Intel's x86-based CPUs at supporting the multitudinous faces of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia is now combining them with its own CPU (branded Grace minus the GPU), which uses the blueprints of Arm, the UK-headquartered company it had been trying to buy from Japanese owner Softbank until regulators sank that deal in late 2021.

Throw in another goodie called BlueField, a so-called data processing unit (DPU), and Nvidia has a formidable CPU/GPU/DPU product to upset Intel. While the bigger opportunity lies in the broad data center and AI markets, Grace Hopper plus BlueField could also be used in virtual and open radio access network (RAN) technology, a small but growing sector Intel has so far dominated as the world's biggest supplier of general-purpose processors. In Softbank, Nvidia already has a client that plans to use its latest chips to handle both AI and 5G workloads.

How would this work from a RAN perspective? In most of today's virtual RANs, Intel's CPUs directly handle a big chunk of software (all the functions categorized as Layers 2 and 3, or L2+). Because they are more computationally demanding, some of or all the baseband functions (Layer 1) often use accelerators, extra silicon dedicated to that task.

Two acceleration techniques have surfaced: lookaside, which continues to rely on the CPU for all but a few functions; and inline, which offloads everything and typically puts the silicon on a separate card that can be slotted into a server. Intel backs lookaside, while Arm's licensees tend to favor inline.

Grace would replace the x86 chip entirely at L2+, with Hopper (the GPU) used for acceleration at Layer 1, said Ronnie Vashista, Nvidia's senior vice president of telecom, answering questions via email. The BlueField DPU, meanwhile, would run timing synchronization for open fronthaul 7.2, an interface between baseband and radios. Developed by the O-RAN Alliance, a specifications body, it is supposed to guarantee interoperability between different suppliers. That was missing from older specifications, forcing operators to buy all their RAN products from the same vendor.

The net result, boasts Nvidia, is a product able to support throughput of 36 Gbit/s on the downlink, a level that operators have struggled to achieve with industry-standard (read Intel-based) servers, according to the company. Thanks to Arm's designs and Nvidia's software, it is also two-and-a-half times more power efficient than competing products, claims Nvidia.

Grace under pressure

None of this means Nvidia is guaranteed to eclipse Intel as the virtual RAN daddy. Just as Intel has failed to make headway in the smartphone sector that Arm dominates, so Arm's licensees have struggled to make data-center inroads for years. In 2022, they had a combined market share of less than 10%, according to Counterpoint Research, with Intel and AMD (which also uses x86 architecture) serving the rest.

While lauded for their energy efficiency, Arm's chips are less powerful than x86 processors and therefore tend to require a higher number of cores, the building blocks of a CPU, to perform the same tasks. Grace comes with 72 Arm cores, whereas server maker HPE is used to dealing with 32-core x86-based CPUs for the telco network. Arm, then, might entail higher upfront costs.

That said, Geetha Ram, HPE's head of telco compute, recently told Light Reading that 128-core CPUs sold by Ampere Computing, another Arm licensee, cost her about the same as 32-core CPUs from Intel and brought a 35% saving in power when used to support the user plane function in a telco network.

A much bigger obstacle is probably the lack of a supporting ecosystem for Arm. Intel has cultivated much closer relationships with server makers like Dell and HPE as well as cloud-computing specialists such as Red Hat, VMware and Wind River, with their containers-as-a-service (CaaS) platforms.

On the RAN side, specifically, it has spent years developing its own reference architecture, called FlexRAN, for Layer 1 software. Ericsson, one of the world's biggest RAN software developers, now has a fully deployable RAN stack that can be used with x86 chips from either Intel or AMD.

Porting this to Arm-based hardware would probably not be doable without some reengineering. ""The same logic would apply but you'd have to rewrite the code to suit the processor,"" said Joe Madden, the founder and president of analyst firm Mobile Experts, during a recent conversation with Light Reading. ""I really believe it's economic forces that bring those barriers down. Once you're at a level where it's just nuances of different processors, then when the market gets big enough those nuances go away.""

Aerial takes flight

Nvidia's answer to FlexRAN appears to be something it calls Aerial. It was previously described to Light Reading (by Nvidia) as a Layer 1 software platform that could be combined with third-party products addressing higher layers. RAN software specialists including Altran (owned by Capgemini), Mavenir and Radisys (owned by India's Reliance) were identified as Nvidia partners back in September 2021.

""We have a number of ISV [independent software vendor] partners that are developing L2+ on the Arm ecosystem and on Grace,"" said Vashista. ""We are not disclosing for Grace specifically at this stage but we have shown already a Radisys L2+ stack with an Nvidia accelerated Layer 1 hosted on an Arm CPU at MWC-B [Mobile World Congress Barcelona].""

Nvidia also has support from server makers, said Vashista, without disclosing names. On the cloud side, meanwhile, it is currently collaborating with Red Hat and Wind River. ""Our goal is to enable every CaaS player,"" said the Nvidia executive.

Japan's Fujitsu is another RAN partner, and Greg Manganello, its network services boss, provided a strong endorsement of Nvidia's AI-plus-RAN capability during an interview at MWC. ""If you want high-performance edge, we are going to pitch Nvidia, and it can do the analytics and has enormous capacity,"" he said.

This seems to be how Softbank plans to use Nvidia. While relatively few details have been made available so far, the Japanese operator has said it wants to build numerous edge data centers that can host AI as well as wireless applications on a common server platform for cost and power efficiency.

This means the 5G part effectively comes free of charge, said Vashista. ""The server is there for AI. It's the multi-use aspect and completely software-defined 5G RAN that is so unique, and it's combined with the performance of the RAN stack.""

What's more, unlike the products being marketed by chip rivals Marvell and Qualcomm, Nvidia's Hopper GPU accelerator does not have to fit on a separate card because it is integrated with the Grace CPU. That addresses a concern of executives such as Tareq Amin, the boss of Japanese telco Rakuten Mobile, who views cards as an extra cost and complication and has ruled out buying them. For telcos that do not share his worries, Nvidia happens to have an accelerator card (the AX800) up its sleeve that can be used with an x86-based server.

Still, Nvidia's pitch implies the economics would be far less favorable if a customer had zero interest in AI and were using its products in a RAN-only scenario. How Nvidia measures up here on a like-for-like basis is unclear, but GPUs have been criticized before now as a power-hungry choice for Layer 1 acceleration.

When it comes to Softbank, there is no information on whose RAN software will be combined with Nvidia chips during rollout, which vendor is contributing the radios that can synchronize with this software and whose cloud underpins it all. Nor has anything been said about the pace of deployment and what it means for Softbank's existing RAN partners. Keep watching this space.

: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not really a new concept as we have all been using AI in some or the other way for years. However, with the popularity of ChatGPT, OpenAI's groundbreaking invention, interest in the AI space has seen a sudden and rapid growth. 
ChatGPT is a generative AI tool that gained popularity for its human-like responses and ability to do almost anything that one could not imagine being a reality a couple of years back.
Many fields have started adapting generative AI technologies and professionals are eager to make use of the emerging technology in their day-to-day lives. And with the power of generative AI, gamers might also get to experience something that the world hasn't seen till now.
Generative AI meets gaming
Nvidia, in a demo during the Computex 2023, showcased the future of gaming where players would be able to leverage generative AI powers and interact with the non playable characters (NPCs) in a game using their own voice. In simpler terms, you, as a gamer, will be able to talk to a game's characters by holding down a button and talking in your own voice.
Presently, gamers can interact with NPCs through dialogue only. Some games, like Horizon Forbidden West and Assassins' Creed Odyssey, during certain missions, give you the option of choosing a dialogue from the options that appear on screen. 
However, in Nvidia's demo, the player was talking to a non-playable character from Cyberpunk.

Talking about generative AI and gaming, John Spitzer, vice president of developer and performance technology at Nvidia, said in a press release, 'Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the interactivity players can have with game characters and dramatically increase immersion in games. Building on our expertise in AI and decades of experience working with game developers, Nvidia is spearheading the use of generative AI in games.'
Popularity of generative AI
As mentioned already, generative AI shot to popularity when ChatGPT was unveiled for the world. The AI chatbot, with its human-like responses, took the world by storm. Months after ChatGPT's launch, in February this year, Microsoft launched its own AI chatbot, the new Bing and Google launched Bard. 
Various other companies are also experimenting with AI technologies, but Bing, Bard and ChatGPT continue to be the talk of the ton for now. While Bing and Bard already have real-time web searching capabilities, ChatGPT will also get this feature soon. All three AI chatbots are available for use and can be accessed easily. 
Talking about AI, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, during the same event, said that the end of 'digital divide' is here. Huang further added that in every computing era, people could do different things that were not possible before and also said that anyone could be a programmer today by using AI.
He said, ""The programming barrier is incredibly low. We have closed the digital divide. Everyone is a programmer now - you just have to say something to the computer.""

COMPUTEX—
NVIDIA and WPP today announced they are developing a content engine that harnesses 
NVIDIA Omniverse
™ and AI to enable creative teams to produce high-quality commercial content faster, more efficiently and at scale while staying fully aligned with a client's brand.
 
The new engine connects an ecosystem of 3D design, manufacturing and creative supply chain tools, including those from Adobe and Getty Images, letting WPP's artists and designers integrate 3D content creation with generative AI. This enables their clients to reach consumers in highly personalized and engaging ways, while preserving the quality, accuracy and fidelity of their company's brand identity, products and logos.
 
NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the engine in a 
demo
 during his 
COMPUTEX keynote address
, illustrating how clients can work with teams at WPP, the world's largest marketing services organization, to make large volumes of brand advertising content such as images or videos and experiences like 3D product configurators more tailored and immersive.
 
'The world's industries, including the $700 billion digital advertising industry, are racing to realize the benefits of AI,' Huang said. 'With Omniverse Cloud and generative AI tools, WPP is giving brands the ability to build and deploy product experiences and compelling content at a level of realism and scale never possible before.'
 
'Generative AI is changing the world of marketing at incredible speed,' said Mark Read, CEO of WPP. 'Our partnership with NVIDIA gives WPP a unique competitive advantage through an AI solution that is available to clients nowhere else in the market today. This new technology will transform the way that brands create content for commercial use, and cements WPP's position as the industry leader in the creative application of AI for the world's top brands.'
 
An Engine for Creativity
The new content engine has at its foundation 
Omniverse Cloud
 — a platform for connecting 3D tools, and developing and operating industrial digitalization applications. This allows WPP to seamlessly connect its supply chain of product-design data from software such as Adobe's 
Substance 3D
 tools for 3D and immersive content creation, plus computer-aided design tools to create brand-accurate, photoreal digital twins of client products.
 
WPP uses responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from partners such as Adobe and Getty Images so its designers can create varied, high-fidelity images from text prompts and bring them into scenes. This includes Adobe Firefly, a family of creative generative AI models, and exclusive visual content from Getty Images created using 
NVIDIA Picasso,
 a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design.
 
With the final scenes, creative teams can render large volumes of brand-accurate, 2D images and videos for classic advertising, or publish interactive 3D product configurators to 
NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network
, a worldwide, graphics streaming network, for consumers to experience on any web device.
 
In addition to speed and efficiency, the new engine outperforms current methods, which require creatives to manually create hundreds of thousands of pieces of content using disparate data coming from disconnected tools and systems.
 
The partnership with NVIDIA builds on WPP's existing leadership position in emerging technologies and generative AI, with award-winning campaigns for major clients around the world.
 
The new content engine will soon be available exclusively to WPP's clients around the world.

: Generative AI has been the talk of the tech world ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT back in November 2022. Since then, a lot of other AI chatbots as well as tools have gained popularity and many tech experts have said that AI is the future. From Bill Gates and Satya Nadella to Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, top tech CEOs have said a lot of things about AI and how it will impact job markets in the future. And now, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that AI will touch every industry and anyone today can be a programmer thanks to the emerging tech. 
For the unversed, Nvidia is one of the largest chipmakers in the world. OpenAI's ChatGPT was created with thousands of Nvidia GPUs.
Nvidia CEO on AI
According to a Reuters report, Huang, while addressing a huge crowd at Computex forum in Taiwan, said that the end of 'digital divide' is here. 
Talking about how we are in a 'new computing era', Huang said that in every computing era people could do different things that were no possible before.
With artificial intelligence, things that weren't possible until now are being done. Echoing this thought, the Nvidia CEO said that in today's times, the barrier of programming is 'incredibly low'. He also added that everyone can be a programmer today as they just have to 'say something to the computer'. 
He said, ""The programming barrier is incredibly low. We have closed the digital divide. Everyone is a programmer now - you just have to say something to the computer.""
Many tech experts have said that AI is growing at a fast pace. Sharing his thoughts on the rate of progression of AI, Huang said, ""The rate of progress, because it's so easy to use, is the reason why it's growing so fast. This is going to touch literally every single industry."" 
OpenAI study lists jobs that AI can replace
In March this year, a study by Open AI, Open Research and the University of Pennsylvania listed various jobs that AI could replace in the future. The study also listed jobs that AI could not replace in the near future. 
According to the study, some of the jobs that are at-risk of getting replaced by AI are that of writers and authors, coders, court reporters, copy marketers, accountants, and others.
The study also mentioned certain jobs that could be marked safe from AI. Among these jobs were that of are cooks, bartenders, painters, plumbers, and so on. 
While some experts believe that AI could be replacing human jobs in future, others argue that AI is no match for the human mind and will prove to be a valuable asset for humans rather than replacing them completely.

COMPUTEX 
-- NVIDIA and SoftBank Corp. today announced they are collaborating on a pioneering platform for generative AI and 5G/6G applications that is based on the 
NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper™ Superchip
 and which SoftBank plans to roll out at new, distributed AI data centers across Japan.
 
Paving the way for the rapid, worldwide deployment of generative AI applications and services, SoftBank will build data centers that can, in collaboration with NVIDIA, host generative AI and wireless applications on a multi-tenant common server platform, which reduces costs and is more energy efficient.
 
The platform will use the new 
NVIDIA MGX™ reference architecture
 with Arm Neoverse-based GH200 Superchips and is expected to improve performance, scalability and resource utilization of application workloads.
 
'As we enter an era where society coexists with AI, the demand for data processing and electricity requirements will rapidly increase. SoftBank will provide next-generation social infrastructure to support the super-digitalized society in Japan,' said Junichi Miyakawa, president and CEO of SoftBank Corp. 'Our collaboration with NVIDIA will help our infrastructure achieve a significantly higher performance with the utilization of AI, including optimization of the RAN. We expect it can also help us reduce energy consumption and create a network of interconnected data centers that can be used to share resources and host a range of generative AI applications.'
 
'Demand for accelerated computing and generative AI is driving a fundamental change in the architecture of data centers,' said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. 'NVIDIA Grace Hopper is a revolutionary computing platform designed to process and scale-out generative AI services. Like with other visionary initiatives in their past, SoftBank is leading the world to create a telecom network built to host generative AI services.'
 
The new data centers will be more evenly distributed across its footprint than those used in the past, and handle both AI and 5G workloads. This will allow them to better operate at peak capacity with low latency and at substantially lower overall energy costs.
 
SoftBank is exploring creating 5G applications for autonomous driving, AI factories, augmented and virtual reality, computer vision and digital twins.
 
Virtual RAN With Record-Breaking Throughput
NVIDIA Grace Hopper and 
NVIDIA BlueField®-3 data processing units
 will accelerate the software-defined 5G vRAN, as well as generative AI applications, without bespoke hardware accelerators or specialized 5G CPUs. Additionally, the 
NVIDIA Spectrum Ethernet switch
 with BlueField-3 will deliver a highly precise timing protocol for 5G.
 
The solution achieves breakthrough 5G speed on an NVIDIA-accelerated 1U MGX-based server design, with industry-high throughput of 36Gbps downlink capacity, based on publicly available data on 5G accelerators. Operators have struggled to deliver such high downlink capacity using industry-standard servers.
 
New Reference Architecture
NVIDIA MGX is a modular reference architecture that enables system manufacturers and hyperscale customers to quickly and cost-effectively build over a hundred different server variations to suit a wide range of AI, HPC and 
NVIDIA Omniverse
™ applications.
 
By incorporating 
NVIDIA Aerial™ software
 for high-performance, software-defined, cloud-native 5G networks, these 5G base stations will allow operators to dynamically allocate compute resources, and achieve 2.5x power efficiency over competing products.
 
'The future of generative AI requires high-performance, energy-efficient compute like that of the Arm Neoverse-based Grace Hopper Superchip from NVIDIA,' said Rene Haas, CEO of Arm. 'Combined with NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, Grace Hopper enables the new SoftBank 5G data centers to run the most demanding compute- and memory-intensive applications and bring exponential efficiency gains to software-defined 5G and AI on Arm.'

159,Nvidia GPU pitch to telcos is far from perfect,Iain Morris,2023-06-05 00:00:00,date,https://www.lightreading.com/semiconductorsnetwork-platforms/nvidia-gpu-pitch-to-telcos-is-far-from-perfect/d/d-id/785176?_mc=RSS_LR_EDT,lightreading.com,The chipmaker's two-for-one AI and virtual RAN deal is unlikely to make sense to operators outside the most densely populated and fiber-rich cities.,"Nvidia has been sizzling like a red-hot chip pan on the greasiest high street in Britain. Carrying a stock-market value of roughly $350 billion when the year started, it briefly joined the trillion-dollar club in late May and had a market cap of more than $970 billion at the start of this week. Investors have swallowed the story that companies will buy the chipmaker's graphical processing units (GPUs) to run a gamut of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and just mentioning AI these days is enough to add a few billion dollars to your market cap.

But Nvidia's GPU pitch to operators is seriously flawed, according to multiple sources with a telco background who preferred to remain anonymous. The basic idea is that a telco could use these GPUs not only for AI but also to build a virtual radio access network (vRAN), one that runs software on general-purpose processors shared with other workloads, all managed by the same cloud-native technologies. Important sections of the industry are unconvinced.

This two-for-the-price-of-one deal – AI with vRAN included like free mushy peas – is needed to justify the investment. GPUs are such a pricey and power-hungry type of chip that using them for vRAN alone would probably not make economic sense. Even Nvidia acknowledged this when asked about putting a GPU at an individual cell site to support RAN software but no other applications. ""There are cheaper ways to implement that,"" said Ronnie Vashista, Nvidia's senior vice president of telecom, on a call with reporters last week.

Just as hard to envisage, however, is that an operator would buy a GPU to host AI applications at an individual site. The biggest customers for Nvidia are clearly the Internet giants, which have been installing GPUs in their massive data centers to handle applications like ChatGPT, the one responsible for most of the recent AI hype. Telcos and other businesses that invest in GPUs for AI will probably do likewise, putting them mainly in centralized facilities.

This is evidently how Nvidia sees its GPUs being deployed. ""We're talking to many telcos today where they have power, they have racks in those sites, and they want to leverage those sites more cost efficiently for other applications as well or more pooling of RAN,"" said Vashista. ""That model is becoming more and more prevalent to run more computational pooling of RAN sites and RAN traffic.""

Pooling problems

Unfortunately, this pooling can only go so far when it comes to the RAN. In most of today's networks, the baseband and other computing is done at the radio site. Virtualization makes it easier to pool central unit (CU) functions not sensitive to latency, a measure of the journey time for data signals. Tommi Uitto, the head of Nokia's mobile business group, reckons a telco in country of the UK's size – where market leader BT maintains about 19,000 sites – could feasibly bring these CUs into about 100 facilities. But he also thinks the distributed units (DUs) hosting the latency-sensitive baseband will largely remain at sites.

""The DU must be no more than 20 kilometers from the cell site because it has real-time-sensitive functions,"" Uitto told Light Reading during a previous interview. ""In practice, it might not make sense for anybody to build a new grid of this type of edge sites, and that is why we believe that most DUs will actually reside at the cell site.""

The exception is likely to be in big cities well served by high-speed fiber networks, he said. Japan's SoftBank, Nvidia's flagship telco customer, told Light Reading it plans to ""consolidate the distributed units to the greatest extent possible."" But SoftBank operates in a country that is unusually rich in fiber. Elsewhere, telcos would need chips for DUs at individual sites, and that makes Nvidia – by its own admission – look very expensive alongside non-GPU-based rivals.

Competitors that include AMD, Intel, Marvell and Qualcomm are offering flavors of customized silicon based on x86 (in the case of AMD and Intel) and Arm (Marvell and Qualcomm) designs. These various options would support some of or all the computationally demanding baseband (also called Layer 1) functions and relieve pressure on the main central processing unit.

Decisions, decisions

Even SoftBank's deployment of Nvidia GPUs seems unlikely to be very extensive. The operator, which claims a 21% share of Japan's mobile market, had already installed more than 50,000 5G basestations, covering almost 91% of the population, by the end of March. Virtualizing this now would entail stripping out equipment and writing off the expense.

SoftBank has also not yet decided which companies will provide the RAN software that runs on these GPUs, and it has not even guaranteed a role for Aerial, Nvidia's own Layer 1 software product. ""We are not able to disclose details, but we are currently in discussions with multiple RAN vendors, as well as discussions on utilizing Nvidia's Aerial,"" said a spokesperson for the operator via email. Decisions have yet to be taken about the providers of cloud tools, radio units and servers hosting the GPUs, as well.

In the meantime, Intel remains the number-one choice for operators that want to virtualize today and move quickly ahead on rollout. Besides its chip technologies, it offers software, experience and a thriving ecosystem of partners. The absence of competition has generated concern about Intel's dominance. But a mainstream challenge may have to come from someone other than Nvidia.",lightreading.com,9466,news,US,en,Iain Morris,https://img.lightreading.com/2023/03/783998/2371.jpg,False,@Light_Reading,9.241832,6fa254dc652529a93f56dd989145ee2e,0.0,0.0,0.9297206401824951,0.0,0.9779387712478638,0.0

The US$830mil (RM3.8bil) Nvidia stake held by Swedbank Robur Technology C makes it the most exposed ESG-registered fund to the world's most valuable chip company, according to the latest data compiled by Bloomberg.
 
That's in a universe of about 1,300 ESG funds that hold Nvidia, the data showed.
 
The US$10.6bil (RM49bil) Swedbank Robur fund gained about 20% last month alone, topping roughly 99% of peers. This year it's up about 40%.
 
Kristofer Barrett, who manages the fund from Stockholm, said he's been trying not to get dragged into the frenzy, because there's plenty of evidence that markets can be 'irrational.'
 
The tech fund he oversees, which is registered as Article 8 in the European Union (EU), meaning it 'promotes' ESG, has held Nvidia since 2016.
 
'Net-net, because of efficiency, productivity, things like that, AI is going to be good for society,' Barrett said.
 
After adding almost a third to its value following a surprisingly strong revenue forecast last week, Nvidia fell 5.7% last Wednesday amid a wider market retreat and then rebounded last Thursday.
 
This year, the stock has added about 170%.
 
There will be 'great opportunities both on the buying and selling side, while the fundamentals change much more slowly,' Barrett said in an interview.
 
'As with everything, where valuations change, there are risks.'
 
The ESG fund industry has long had an outsize exposure to tech, which investors have treated as an easy path to low-CO2 portfolios.
 
During the pandemic, that bet paid off as low interest rates and global work-from-home policies buoyed the sector.
 
But last year, everything changed.
 
Higher rates and an energy supply crisis caused by Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine made tech a losing bet, which fuelled a polarising debate around the future of ESG.
 
Now, the pendulum appears to be swinging yet again. The world's best-performing ESG funds this year have all booked returns exceeding 30% and are packed full of tech, covering everything from long-standing giants such as Microsoft Corp, to newer names in renewables, AI and semiconductors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 
In fact, tech is by far the biggest sector in so-called Article 9 funds, the EU's top ESG designation, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence that looked at the 60 most-held stocks.
 
Aside from the Swedbank Robur fund, the biggest ESG portfolio exposures to Nvidia are an US$8.2bil (RM38bil) exchange-traded fund managed by BlackRock Inc, the iShares MSCI USA SRI UCITS.
 
There's also an US$8bil (RM37bil) technology fund managed by Franklin Resources Inc, according to the latest data compiled by Bloomberg.
 
ESG's exposure to tech is now helping it outperform traditional funds, said Joachim Klement, a strategist at Liberum Capital.
 
But the ESGness of such investments is worth debating, he said. That's because the rise of AI means computing-intensive applications will rise in popularity, which implies a rise in energy consumption.
 
'As long as server farms and computers that perform AI applications aren't run with renewable energy, that is bad news for the environment since the AI boom implies a larger demand for electricity generated with fossil fuels,' he said.
 
Across all its ESG portfolios, Swedbank AB, the parent of the unit that runs the Swedbank Robur Technology C fund, holds more than US$1.4bil (RM6.4bil) of Nvidia stock, according to the latest available Bloomberg data.
 
BlackRock's exposure via ESG funds is about US$3.6bil (RM16.4bil) in total, while Credit Agricole SA has roughly US$1.8bil (RM8.2bil) through its ESG investment business.
 
Nvidia's ascent to the stratosphere of tech gains has surprised even analysts who closely track the stock.
 
As it morphs from a maker of computer-graphics chips into a company that's at the centre of the boom in AI, it's been able to deliver market-beating sales forecasts that have seen it test a US$1 trillion (RM4.6 trillion) valuation.
 
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive officer, wowed investors last Monday with a new array of products and services that showcased the company's dominance in AI.
 
The centerpiece was an AI supercomputer platform called DGX GH200, intended to help companies including Microsoft and Alphabet Inc's Google to move beyond ChatGPT.

162,Nvidia's NeMo Guardrails Enhances Safety in Generative AI Applications,Andrew Hoblitzell,2023-06-14 00:00:00,date,https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/06/nvidia-nemo-safety-ai/,infoq.com,"Nvidia's new NeMo Guardrails package for large language models (LLMs) helps developers prevent LLM risks like harmful or offensive content and access to sensitive data, by providing an essential layer…","Nvidia's new 
NeMo Guardrails
 package for large language models (LLMs) helps developers prevent LLM risks like harmful or offensive content and access to sensitive data. This innovation is crucial for developers as it offers multiple features to control the behavior of these models, thereby ensuring their safer deployment. Specifically, NeMo Guardrails helps mitigate the risks of LLMs generating harmful or offensive content thereby providing an essential layer of protection in an increasingly AI-driven landscape.


NeMo Guardrails helps developers to mitigate the risks associated with LLMs by providing a number of features to control the behavior of these models. The package is built on 
Colang
, a modeling language and runtime developed by Nvidia for conversational AI. ""If you have a customer service chatbot, designed to talk about your products, you probably don't want it to answer questions about our competitors,"" said 
Jonathan Cohen
, Nvidia vice president of applied research. ""You want to monitor the conversation. And if that happens, you steer the conversation back to the topics you prefer"".


NeMo Guardrails currently supports three broad categories: Topical, Safety, and Security. Topical guardrails ensure that conversations stay focused on a particular topic. Safety guardrails ensure that interactions with an LLM do not result in misinformation, toxic responses, or inappropriate content. They also enforce policies to deliver appropriate responses and prevent hacking of the AI systems. Security guardrails prevent an LLM from executing malicious code or calls to an external application in a way that poses security.


Guardrails features a sandbox environment, allowing developers the freedom to experiment with AI models without jeopardizing production systems, thus reducing the risk of generating harmful or offensive content. Additionally, a risk dashboard is provided, which consistently tracks and scrutinizes the use of AI models, assisting developers in identifying and mitigating potential risks before they lead to major issues. Moreover, it supplies a clear set of policies and guidelines designed to direct the usage of AI within organizations.


Reception has generally been positive about NeMo-Guardrails, but some have expressed caution around the limitations. There are certain limitations and constraints developers need to be aware of when using this LLM package. 
Karl Freund
 of Cambrian-AI Research writes ""guardrails could be circumvented or otherwise compromised by malicious actors, who could exploit weaknesses in the system to generate harmful or misleading information"". 
Jailbreaks
, 
hallucinations
, and other issues also remain active research areas which no current system has implemented fullproof protection against.


Other tools also exist for safety when working with large language models. For example, Language Model Query Language (
LMQL
) is designed to make natural language prompting and is built on top of Python. Microsoft's 
Guidance
 framework can also be used for addressing issues with LLMs not guaranteeing that output follows a specific data format​.


Nvidia advises that Guardrails works best as a second line of defense, suggesting that companies developing and deploying chatbots should still train the model on a set of safeguards with multiple layers.

While Nvidia's stock price has gone to the stratosphere this year, the company was hardly an overnight success story. It completed its 
initial public offering
 way back in 1999 and has steadily built up its business over the years to get to the point where it was able to become one of the country's most important enterprises. 


Nvidia's 30-Year Journey


Nvidia was founded in April 1993, and thus turned 30 years old recently. Jensen Huang co-founded the company and remains its CEO today. Back in 1993, Huang and the other co-founders realized that graphics-based computing would be a large opportunity in coming years. Innovations in the 
video gaming market
 would give Nvidia a profitable niche to sell to while allowing the company to build up the research and development and patent base necessary to branch out into related fields. 


Nvidia launched the first model of its GeForce graphics card in 1999, the same year as its 
IPO
. Over the years, GeForce has gone on to become the dominant brand in graphics cards for high-resolution gaming and video performance. Nvidia was hardly just a one-trick pony though, as its business has moved well beyond video gaming. 


Investors have reaped the rewards along the way. Nvidia split its stock in 2000, 2001, 2006, 2007 and 2021, respectively. All told, an investor who bought 100 shares of NVDA stock in the 1999 IPO would now own 4,800 shares of Nvidia thanks to all the share splits along the way. Shares started trading at around 40 cents each on a split-adjusted basis in 1999. Shares were still going for around $5 as recently as 2015. That's when Nvidia's second act, 
cryptocurrency
, really kicked into gear. 


As it would turn out, Nvidia graphics cards ended up being ideally suited for solving the cryptographic puzzles needed to mine 
Bitcoin
 and other leading proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies. As the prices of cryptocurrency soared, digital asset-mining firms could afford to invest a lot more in Nvidia's GPUs to mint more digital coins and tokens. Nvidia's revenues saw exponential growth, jumping from $5 billion in 2016 to more than $11.7 billion in 2019 amid the historic surge in the price of Bitcoin and related cryptos. 


While cryptocurrency-related graphics card demand has dried up more recently, Nvidia enjoyed a huge rise in demand for high-end gaming cards during the pandemic as people were stuck at home with more time to pursue their hobbies. In addition, Nvidia's data center business has also enjoyed robust growth. This led revenues to further surge to $27 billion for fiscal year 2023. And now, with the exponential jump in orders for 
artificial intelligence
-related chips this past quarter, it seems clear that generative AI and large language models will power the next act of Nvidia's tremendous growth story.

10 Best-Performing Stocks of the Past 30 Years
]


Nvidia Stock by the Numbers


From the 1999 IPO onward, Nvidia has grown its revenues by 6,810%. Interestingly, most of this growth occurred within the past few years as Nvidia made large strides outside of the video game graphics space. The company's net income grew by an even larger sum, jumping 11,580% since 1999. 


A $10,000 investment in Nvidia made in June 2003 would have grown to a stunning $2.286 million today. This works out to an incredible 31.2% 
compound annual growth rate
 for investors that held on over the past 20 years. This return trounced the S&P 500, which delivered a 9.8% compound annual growth rate over the same time period. 


Nvidia: What Analysts and Investors Are Saying


Famed investor Stanley Druckenmiller, while attending an investing conference, recently discussed his purchase of Nvidia shares: 'If it's as big as I think it is, Nvidia is something we are going to want to own for at least two or three years.' While Druckenmiller conceded that the firm's valuation level is 'lofty' today, he countered that objection by noting that: 'I do believe, unlike crypto, AI is real […] it could be as transformative as the internet.' 


While it may be too early to dismiss crypto entirely, it's true that AI-powered developments such as 
ChatGPT
 and image generation products seem likely to gain mass consumer adoption in a way that non-fungible tokens and 
blockchain
 never quite achieved. These impressive AI applications serve as the sort of must-have product that makes artificial intelligence seemingly more likely to sustain a long bull run than other recent technological developments. 


However, some analysts are less convinced about Nvidia's valuation at today's prices. Morningstar's Abhinav Davuluri sees fair value at $300 per share, which would mark significant downside from Nvidia's current price. Davuluri recently wrote: 'Our $300 fair value estimate assumes a fiscal 2024 (year ending January 2024) adjusted price/earnings ratio of 37 times. We project revenue will increase at a 23% compound annual growth rate through fiscal 2028 as the firm continues to diversify its revenue sources to areas of strong potential.' Even with a generous P/E ratio of 37 and a revenue growth rate running well into the 20s annually, it's still challenging to support an Nvidia stock price above $400 based on the firm's near-term earnings projections. 


The counterargument to that, however, would be that Nvidia's revenues are rapidly accelerating thanks to the step change in adoption of AI technologies over the past six months. Nvidia's last earnings report gave some evidence for that, with the firm's revenues and outlook jumping far ahead of anyone's prior expectations. 


This factor led Goldman Sachs analyst Tony Pasquariello to write: 'AI has taken off like a rocket and drawn all kinds of investors in.' He went on to suggest that the 
momentum
 behind AI stocks such as Nvidia could keep on rolling for quite a while, saying, 'Recall the wisdom of a great tech investor: ‘positive earnings surprises occur when revenue and earnings growth are accelerating, when average selling prices are rising, and when gross margin and operating margin are rising.'' 


Right now, Nvidia appears to be in the early stages of what should be a sustained period of sharply rising demand as large enterprises race to deploy their own AI models going forward. In this sort of AI arms race, the momentum factor that Pasquariello alluded to could prevail over more fundamental-driven valuation analysis, at least in the intermediate term. Investors tend to do well when there is accelerating revenue growth and rising profit margins. 


Nvidia shares are already up a tremendous amount in 2023, and it's hard to argue that shares are a bargain today based on traditional 
valuation
 metrics. However, analysts are projecting an incredible 59% revenue growth rate for Nvidia in fiscal 2024, driven by an insatiable increase in AI-related investments. Given the strength of that underlying trend, and Nvidia's tremendous longer-term track record, it wouldn't be surprising if Nvidia can continue to rally despite the elevated starting valuation.

:


In recent years, a significant number of people in Morocco have been commuting daily to Casablanca, the country's economic capital. This heavy traffic flow has led to congestion and accidents during certain times of the day as the city's roads cannot handle the high volume of vehicles passing through. To address this issue, it is essential to expand the infrastructure based on accurate traffic-flow data. In collaboration with the municipality of Bouskoura, a neighboring city of Casablanca, we proposed installing a smart camera on the primary route connecting the two cities. This camera would enable us to gather accurate statistics on the number and types of vehicles crossing the road, which can be used to adapt and redesign the existing infrastructure. We implemented our system using the YOLOv7-tiny object detection model to detect and classify the various types of vehicles (such as trucks, cars, motorcycles, and buses) crossing the main road. Additionally, we used the Deep SORT tracking method to track each vehicle appearing on the camera and to provide the total number of each class for each lane, as well as the number of vehicles passing from one lane to another. Furthermore, we deployed our solution on an embedded system, specifically the Nvidia Jetson Nano. This allowed us to create a compact and efficient system that is capable of a real-time processing of camera images, making it suitable for deployment in various scenarios where limited resources are required. Deploying our solution on the Nvidia Jetson Nano showed promising results, and we believe that this approach could be applied in similar traffic-surveillance projects to provide accurate and reliable data for better decision-making.


 










 


Bouskoura is a Moroccan city located approximately twenty kilometers south of the economic capital, Casablanca. Recently, the city has experienced a significant increase in population, resulting in a rise in road traffic as many individuals commute to and from Casablanca for work. This has led to direct congestion, particularly at intersections, resulting in increased travel time, vehicle blockages, and heightened fuel consumption. Congestion can cause driver stress and frustration [
1
], which can significantly impact individuals' performance and efficiency, lowering economic productivity and reducing the quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a traffic-management strategy that improves the design of existing roads [
2
].
Deep learning is a rapidly growing subfield of artificial intelligence that has shown a remarkable ability to learn from vast amounts of data and can solve complex problems with high accuracy [
3
,
4
]. However, this often requires access to powerful computing resources and significant data storage, making it challenging to deploy deep-learning algorithms in resource-limited environments [
5
,
6
].
To address this challenge, our study proposes a solution that leverages deep-learning techniques to analyze the traffic data collected by our smart camera and to make informed decisions on which road lanes to expand or extend. By designing our solution with consideration for resource constraints, we can demonstrate the feasibility of deploying deep learning in real-world applications with limited resources. Deep learning has already shown great potential for improving traffic management and our solution provides a promising avenue for addressing traffic congestion challenges in urban environments.
In this paper, we present an efficient system that leverages modern image processing and artificial-intelligence technologies to support decision-making regarding which road lanes to extend or expand. Our system uses a smart camera equipped with an Nvidia Jetson Nano card to gather statistics. The camera records the number of vehicles by category at each intersection lane daily and calculates the precise count of vehicles moving from a certain entrance to a certain exit. All processing is carried out on the card, and the resulting statistics are then transmitted via the standard IoT messaging protocol MQTT [
7
] for further analysis and decision support.
Our initial task was to create an application that could enable us to gather a substantial dataset to construct our detection and classification model. For data collection, we utilized an Allwinner A133 embedded card with a Linux system. The card was programmed to capture video sequences from an IP camera installed at the same intersection. The data were then stored in an external memory card and transmitted to a server via FTP with a secondary program.
We used these videos to create a dataset of 13,000 images. For object detection, we employed YOLOv7 (you only look once, version 7), which is currently the most reliable and easily deployable model available [
8
]; it was selected based on these qualities, as well as its compatibility with the Nvidia Jetson Nano card. The images were manually labeled into four classes: cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses. Manual labeling was essential to ensure the accuracy and precision of the labeled data, resulting in a higher-quality classification model. By manually labeling the images, we were able to carefully inspect and classify each object in the images, reducing the likelihood of errors or misclassifications. Our model of vehicle detection and classification was trained using 7000 images for training, 4000 for validation, and 2000 for testing. We evaluated the performance of our trained model using several measures, including a mean average precision (mAP) at a threshold of 0.5 of 91%, a recall of 84.1%, and a precision of 87.2%. After detection and recognition, we utilized the Deep SORT algorithm for vehicle tracking. Finally, the counting of vehicles on each road at the intersection was conducted by using a mathematical formula that calculated the intersection of two segments to trigger a vehicle count in increments. Finally, we calculated the number of vehicles passing from one road to another; this calculation was based on tracking that allows us to identify each vehicle and follow it throughout the scene with the information found previously, which is the number of vehicles passing through each road.
Our main contribution is the development of a robust and efficient vehicle-counting solution that can be deployed on the Nvidia Jetson Nano card. We achieved this by leveraging a large dataset, which was collected with an attention to different scenarios and conditions. This allowed us to train a high-performing detection model that can detect vehicles with high accuracy and low latency. In addition to detection, we utilized a tracking algorithm, Deep SORT, which maintains the identity of each vehicle as it moves throughout the roundabout, improving the counting accuracy of the system. Our solution offers several advantages over traditional methods, including speed, accuracy, and scalability. Deploying the solution on the Nvidia Jetson Nano card ensures low latency and high performance, making it ideal for real-time applications. In our experimental results, we demonstrated that our solution outperforms existing methods, achieving high accuracy and low error rates. We believe that our contribution can pave the way for more efficient and accurate vehicle-counting systems, which can have significant applications in areas such as traffic management, security, and surveillance.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2
 presents the previous works that deal with similar projects, i.e., 'counting vehicles in embedded systems'. 
Section 3
 provides a brief overview of our project, including the cost of the solution and a detailed description of the overall architecture. Each component of the architecture is discussed in a separate subsection. 
Section 4
 explains the experimental results. 
Section 5
 includes a discussion and, finally, a conclusion.
The main objective of our paper is to develop an intelligent camera system capable of processing a camera feed in real time to calculate the number of vehicles in each category passing through an intersection, as well as the total number of vehicles passing through each path. In the literature, we found various pieces of research and projects related to this problem and we would like to cite some examples.
Abuelgasim et al. [
9
] presented a vehicle-counting system that utilized the YOLOv5 algorithm for object detection and Deep SORT for tracking. They collected a database of vehicles with four classes and deployed their system on an Nvidia Jetson Nano card, which can process at a speed of 15 fps. However, their system was only tested on videos; to truly evaluate the performance of a solution, it should be tested in real-time conditions under various lighting and weather conditions. Therefore, to ensure optimal performance, it is necessary to train a robust model that can handle different lighting and weather conditions.
Duc-Liem et al., 2021 [
10
] presented a low-cost and effective system that integrated object detection models to detect, track, and count vehicles. They created a vehicle detection dataset representing traffic conditions in Vietnam and evaluated several deep learning models on two different types, a Coral Dev Board that supported TPU and then an Nvidia Jetson Nano Board that supported GPU. However, their study acknowledged the need to improve the inference time of the model for optimal performance. To address this limitation, our work aims to optimize the inference time, thus making a system that is even more practical for traffic control and management.
Valladares et al., 2021 [
11
] assessed the performance of Nvidia cards by using machine learning to count vehicles in real time in the city of Quito, Ecuador. They evaluated performance based on several factors, including resource utilization (GPU and CPU), power consumption, the temperature of the card, and the RAM usage during processing. Additionally, they confirmed the need to increase the precision of their model, as the use of OpenDataCam for vehicle-counting and identification proved effective, but certain factors such as camera position, lighting, vehicle size and speed, and traffic flow needed to be considered. Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution that can adapt to all these conditions.
Yan Han et al., 2017 [
12
] developed a driving-assistance system utilizing embedded cards, such as the Nvidia Jetson. The system consists of two components: the first one utilizes image processing techniques to locate signs, while the second uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the detected signs. The proposed system was implemented on the Nvidia Jetson TX1 board with a web camera. Although the system achieved a high detection accuracy of 96%, the frame rate was low, at 1.6 frames per second (FPS). Therefore, a faster model is needed to be deployed on the Jetson card.
Zhihui Wang et al., 2020 [
13
], proposed an integrated solution that combines detection, tracking, and trajectory modeling algorithms for vehicle detection and counting. They utilized a GMM-type backward modeling approach along with a machine-learning-based detector to enhance the accuracy of vehicle detection and counting precision. They also implemented a trajectory modeling scheme that considers the direction and trajectory of the vehicles. However, their algorithm still has limitations, such as typical detection failures, false positives due to dynamic backgrounds or reflections, and missing detections of vehicles that are too large or too small. Therefore, there is a need to consider more robust algorithms to overcome these issues.
We have taken into consideration the limitations and difficulties highlighted by previous studies in the field of vehicle detection and counting. To improve the performance of this research, we have proposed the use of alternative algorithms for object detection and a new method of vehicle-counting that is adaptable to the specific requirements of the system. Additionally, we have collected a new database of vehicles that considers all the possible detection difficulties, such as occlusion, illumination variations, or bad weather conditions, to ensure a more robust and reliable detection and counting system.
The proposed traffic-management system aims to analyze the traffic at an intersection located between Bouskoura and Casablanca. For this purpose, we installed an IP camera connected to an Nvidia Nano Jetson card, which serves as our processing unit. 
Figure 1
 shows some of the images captured during the installation. Our system functions as a smart camera capable of detecting and tracking vehicles in real time. One of the most important features of our camera is that it follows the concept of edge computing, which means that the analysis is performed directly on the device, and only the counting results are transmitted. This has two main advantages: first, we do not need to transmit the images, which reduces bandwidth requirements; second, we respect the privacy of citizens, which is a crucial consideration for any application deployed in a public place.
To provide a practical and informative solution, we have included the current cost of each piece of equipment used in our system. 
Table 1
 summarizes the estimated cost of each component:
The system architecture of the proposed traffic management system is composed of several components, including data acquisition, object detection and classification, object tracking and identification, counting, and data transmission. The data-acquisition component captures video footage of the traffic at each intersection using a smart camera and statistics are calculated and transmitted via the MQTT protocol. The object detection and classification component uses the YOLOv7-tiny algorithm for vehicle identification and classification. The object tracking and identification component uses the Deep SORT algorithm to track and identify vehicles. The counting component combines image processing techniques and deep-learning algorithms to count the number of vehicles passing through each lane. Finally, the data-transmission component is responsible for transmitting the processed traffic data to a centralized server for further analysis and decision-making via the MQTT protocol.
Figure 2
 shows the architectural overview of the proposed system, including its components.
Before deciding to build a custom detection model, we tested several existing models based on other datasets, such as COCO. However, these models did not meet the desired level of accuracy due to the constraint of having only one camera covering all the lanes of the intersection. The camera captures large vehicles that are close but the problem arises with vehicles in other lanes that are further away and appear smaller in size. To address this issue, we decided to build a dataset that met our needs by using the same camera deployed in the intersection. This approach ensured that the detection and tracking were optimized for the specific camera and consequently improved the accuracy of the counting, which is the primary purpose of our application.
To build our dataset, we used an embedded system with a Linux system based on the Allwinner A133 motherboard. We programmed the board to capture video footage throughout the day from the IP camera installed at the intersection. The videos were stored on a memory card and sent to the server via FTP with a Python program that removed the successfully transmitted videos.
We carefully filtered the collected video sequences to obtain images that contained diversified sets representing different classes (cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles) at different times of the day and in varying weather conditions, ensuring that all possible variations of the real world were included.
The dataset contains 13,000 images, which were manually annotated using the labeling tool with the text extension of YOLO.
Figure 3
 shows the system architecture used for the dataset collection.
To select the best algorithm for our vehicle detection and classification task, we needed to consider several criteria, including real-time detection with high reliability and deployment ability on the Nvidia Jetson Nano card. After careful consideration, we chose the YOLOv7 as the most suitable detection algorithm for our application as it has been successfully tested in several real-world applications [
8
,
14
,
15
]. YOLOv7 is characterized by a unique CNN architecture that processes multiple networks separately [
8
].
In a YOLO model (the general structure [
8
] of which is represented in 
Figure 4
), the back part is the part that groups the pixels of the image. The representations of the layers of the convolutional network are combined and blended in the neck; then, they are passed to the prediction head. The head is the final part of the CNN, in which our YOLO model predicts the object classes and locations.
We carried out a comparative analysis of YOLOv7 with other YOLO versions, including YOLOv4 and YOLOv5. Our study revealed that YOLOv7 outperforms both YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 in terms of accuracy, parameters, and computation. Specifically, YOLOv7 showed a 1.5% higher average precision (AP) than YOLOv4-tiny, while reducing the number of parameters by 75% and computation by 36%. Moreover, the more edge-optimized version of YOLOv7, YOLOv7-tiny, achieved the same AP as YOLOv4-tiny, while using 39% fewer parameters and requiring 49% less computation. When compared to YOLOv5-N, YOLOv7-tiny demonstrated a 10.7% higher accuracy on AP and was 127 FPS faster [
16
].
Our custom model for vehicle detection and classification was trained using the transfer learning approach, and it was based on the pretrained weight file of YOLOv7-tiny [
17
] and our annotated dataset. We ran YOLOv7-tiny on the Nvidia Jetson Nano as this model can work faster on this type of device. Overall, our comparative study and choice of YOLOv7 demonstrate that it is a highly effective and efficient algorithm for real-time vehicle detection and classification.
In object tracking applications, there is the problem of correctly identifying the same object over multiple frames of a video. Deep SORT addresses this issue by assigning a unique identification (ID) to each detected object and by using a combination of appearance and motion information to track the object over time. To achieve the objective of our project, which is the counting of vehicles, we need to track all the vehicles accurately, which is a crucial task in this type of application. The tracking of objects involves detecting the object, identifying it in a frame, and tracking it across all sequences until it leaves the scene. To achieve this task, we chose to use the Deep SORT algorithm (simple online and real-time tracking with a deep association metric), which is a multiobject tracking method. The Deep SORT algorithm uses the spatial and temporal characteristics of the targets to track and maintain the identification of all moving objects in all sequences [
18
] (as shown in 
Figure 5
). By assigning each detected object a unique ID, Deep SORT ensures that the same vehicle is consistently identified and tracked across multiple frames, allowing for accurate vehicle-counting.
The Deep SORT algorithm consists of the following steps (as is shown in 
Figure 6
): First, the vehicles are detected using the YOLOv7-tiny. Then comes the multiobject tracking step, where the Kalman filter predicts the trajectories based on the position and speed of the target object; meanwhile, the Hungarian algorithm measures the correlation [
19
].
Deep SORT distinguishes itself by using a combination of two convolutional layers, followed by six residual blocks and an appearance descriptor [
19
]. This makes the system more robust against missing-object occlusions by significantly reducing the number of identity changes. This combination makes Deep SORT an appropriate choice for applications requiring real-time monitoring. Furthermore, Deep SORT has been shown to be effective in handling complex scenarios with significant occlusion, which is a common challenge in tracking vehicles that are using a roundabout. The algorithm is also capable of tracking vehicles with varying speeds and trajectories, making it ideal for real-world applications.
Additionally, the ability of Deep SORT to maintain the identity of each vehicle as it moves throughout the roundabout helps to improve the accuracy of the vehicle-counting system. Overall, the combination of traditional tracking methods with deep-learning techniques, the ability to handle complex scenarios, and the ability to maintain the identity of each vehicle makes",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Aarab,Abdellah Aarab,Abouch,Elmanaa,Imane Elmanaa,My Abdelouahed,My Abdelouahed Sabri,Sabri,Yassine Abouch",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/applsci/applsci-13-07416/article_deploy/html/images/applsci-13-07416-g001-550.jpg?1687442908,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,8.131584,254037192e365afb1beae1c61d4b7d9f,0.9993076324462891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9997580647468567,0.0

Index gains have been largely driven by the 'surging seven' – Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet. 
Stocktake has covered this theme repeatedly of late, but breadth finally appears to be improving. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which weighs each component stock equally, has been strong lately, suggesting more stocks are participating in the rally. 
The percentage of stocks above their 50-day (62 per cent) and 200-day average (60 per cent) is rising. Hi Mount Research's Willie Delwiche, who has been concerned by weak breadth this year, is encouraged by the fact the number of stocks hitting new highs is now exceeding the number of new lows. Markets have been more 'balanced' in June, says Bespoke Investment. 
At the end of May, just three of the S&P 500′s 11 sectors had outperformed the index. However, every sector is up in June, with the number of outperformers 'much more evenly split'. 
Market breadth still isn't great but buying is no longer confined to technology stocks, says Barclays, which may be 'a prelude to a sustained breakout from the recent trading range'.",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,Proinsias O'Mahony,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/WWiSC2Pl_WqHRYeEqbsCYc70HEo=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/5WJLWWDLZBCO5PNZQTDITQNFDI.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,7.276452,dc1d00580226d348de5f8d4a69f45a01,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

171,Asus Dual Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition Review,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,2023-06-28 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-dual-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-oc-edition,pcmag.com,"Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 (tested here in Asus livery) produces exceptional ray-tracing performance, thanks to its ""Ada Lovelace"" architecture. It's the best modern, moderate-cost graphics card for 1080p gaming.","When it launched at the end of May 2023, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti didn't make many waves—it was the video-card equivalent of a $399 ripple. Its positioning as the best graphics card for 1080p gaming just didn't sit right at that price. Smooth play at 1080p resolution has long been the goal of many gamers, but today it's more of an entry point than an aspiration. Paying $399 for fast performance at the lowest resolution anyone cares about today just isn't logical anymore. AMD's latest top graphics card for 1080p gaming, the AMD Radeon RX 7600, launching at just $269, didn't help Nvidia's case for the RTX 4060 Ti, either.

Now, the $299 GeForce RTX 4060 is Nvidia's chance to retaliate against its lower-priced Radeon competitor. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 (without the ""Ti"") charges out with a far more competitive price than its bigger brother. We tested the Asus Dual Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition card (MSRP: $299) to see just what we can expect from the new RTX 4060 series of GPUs. Off the bat, performance is notably slower than the RTX 4060 Ti, and, as tech enthusiasts, we can't help but to always want to see more from new parts. Still, it's fast enough to make the RTX 4060, based on this Asus model, the best 1080p graphics choice available today, earning it our Editors' Choice award in the budget 1080p category.

Nvidia's RTX 40 Series Design: A Brief Recap of Ada Lovelace

Like all Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 4060 is built on a customized 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, and it utilizes Nvidia's ""Ada Lovelace"" microarchitecture. If you aren't familiar with the improvements inherent in this new architecture, check out my review of the GeForce RTX 4090 for more details. But we'll briefly go over the architecture's highlights here.

Nvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture has a number of key benefits, including supporting higher clock speeds, thanks to the new manufacturing process. Ray-tracing performance, in particular, has improved significantly with Ada Lovelace graphics cards, now featuring a third-generation ray-tracing core that's faster and more effective than previous designs by Nvidia. The company also greatly boosted the amount of cache on its graphics cards, which I'll discuss more later on.

The last and possibly most significant improvement in the RTX 40 Series graphics cards is that they support Nvidia's DLSS 3 technology. This tech uses frame generation, which extrapolates new frames between two existing frames. This can boost frame rates if the graphics card has extra processing power to spare.

AD107: The RTX 4060 Core, and the Asus Dual Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 is powered by an AD107 GPU core that consists of three graphics processing clusters (GPCs) with eight streaming multiprocessors (SMs) each, for a total of 24 SMs. Each SM contains 128 CUDA cores, and all of these are active inside of the GeForce RTX 4060, giving you a total core count of 3,072 CUDA cores.

The AD107 also contains 96 Tensor cores, 96 texture mapping units (TMUs), 48 ROPs, and 24 third-gen ray-tracing cores. Nvidia's reference design calls for the core to be set with a base clock of 1,830MHz and a boost clock of 2,460MHz. This was slightly elevated on our Asus Dual Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition graphics card, with a rated boost clock of 2,505MHz. That represents almost a 2% overclock, which shouldn't drastically change results versus the reference spec.

With both positive and negative points, the memory system on this card takes a little extra consideration. On the plus side are the greatly expanded cache pools, with 3MB of L1 cache and 24MB of L2 cache on the RTX 4060 relative to just 3MB of L2 cache on the preceding RTX 3060 and even less L1 cache. This huge amount of cache has a noticeable impact on performance and helps to drive up performance at all resolutions, but it's most apparent at 1080p.

The not-so-good side of things is the actual memory system on the GeForce RTX 4060. The AD107 contains four 32-bit memory controllers that add up to an aggregate 128-bit memory interface. This is paired with 8GB of GDDR6 memory that's effectively clocked at 8,500MHz, resulting in 272GBps of bandwidth. This is considerably less than the 360GBps of bandwidth that the previous GeForce RTX 3060 has available to it.

Ultimately, this design choice hampers the RTX 4060's performance at higher resolutions, especially at 4K. However, in its defense, this problem isn't nearly as severe as it is on the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, which has slightly more bandwidth.

The Asus Dual Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition that I am using for our tests today features a dual-slot, dual-fan thermal solution with a metal backplate. Asus opted against using the 12VHPWR power connector on this card, which Nvidia has been pressing onto many of its new graphics cards. Instead, this model features an 8-pin PCI Express power connector. This gives it ample power headroom, as the card is rated to pull at most only 115 watts (W), and the 8-pin power connector can provide at least 150W to the card.

On the card's rear I/O panel, you get a more-or-less standardized set of ports, with one HDMI port and three DisplayPort jacks.

Note that Nvidia didn't create an Nvidia-branded Founders Edition model of the GeForce RTX 4060, which is why we are testing an Asus model this time around. According to Nvidia, all models of the RTX 4060 from board partners that will sell at the $299 MSRP will go on sale June 28 (the date of this review), with higher-priced, overclocked models due to go on sale the 29th. The RTX 4060 stays relatively cool while in use, as we'll show in our thermal tests, and as a result you can find models with one, two, or three fans depending on whether you want a compact model, or one with a bit more overclocking headroom.

Test Setup and Competition

Our graphics testbed was last revamped in 2022 with an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard and an Intel Core i9-12900K processor that's set at stock clock speeds. The processor is actively cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler, and we have 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM clocked at 5,600MHz available to the host system. We opted to use a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD as the primary storage device for this system with no secondary storage device present.

The system is powered by a Corsair HX1500i 1,500W 80 Plus Platinum power supply, and all tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with all of the latest Windows updates installed.

Without a doubt, the most rigorous competition for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 will come from AMD's new Radeon RX 7600 and Nvidia's own GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. However, I also expect to see a considerable amount of competition from last-gen cards, like AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060, both of which are available at roughly similar prices to the Radeon RX 4060.

Synthetic Tests

We use synthetic tests to gauge a card's peak potential performance in various tasks. These results always need to be taken with a pinch of salt as they are synthetic and not representative of true real-world tests, but they can be informative nevertheless.

Starting off with 3DMark, the GeForce RTX 4060 was in a relatively respectable position, and about where I would expect. The RTX 4060 held a decent lead over the Radeon RX 7600 in 3DMark's Port Royal test that utilizes ray-tracing technology, but it was slightly slower in the Time Spy test that does not use ray tracing. It's also clearly faster than the older RTX 3060.

Unigine's Superposition test also showed the RTX 4060 with a slight lead over the Radeon RX 7600 too, and LuxMark, which tests GPGPU performance, showed the RTX 4060 with an enormous (nearly two-fold) performance advantage. Only in Furmark did the Radeon RX 7600 hold a notable lead over the RTX 4060, at least as far as synthetic tests go.

Ray Tracing, DLSS, and FSR Testing

Ray-tracing performance has stood out as a major talking point for Nvidia's new RTX 40 series graphics cards, and so has DLSS 3. The tests in this section make use of both technologies, and as such I expect to see the RTX 4060 tend to do better here than its closest competition.

Sure enough, in the first test with F1 22 without DLSS or FSR on, that's exactly what I saw: The RTX 4060 held a fairly substantial lead over the RX 7600. It also easily passed the Radeon RX 6700 XT, as well as the old RTX 3060. But this situation changed with DLSS 2 and FSR 1.0 enabled, giving the Radeon RX 7600 and the Radeon RX 6700 XT each a slight lead.

In this case, DLSS 3 didn't help the RTX 4060. DLSS 3 can help to improve performance, but it only works if the graphics card has the extra muscle to spare. If it doesn't, it can hamper performance instead, as the card wastes some of its power trying to artificially generate new frames instead of doing the processing work for creating true frames.

We haven't had time to test all of our graphics cards with the game Returnal as of yet, as it's a relatively new addition to our test process. For now, these results are most useful for seeing how performance scales on cards with different image-manipulation technologies. Performance here was unquestionably far ahead of the Radeon RX 7600 with or without DLSS or FSR enabled. I also found one slightly unusual result here, with the RTX 4060 beating the RTX 4060 Ti when DLSS 3 was enabled. This is likely due to some amount of optimization in the RTX 4060's launch driver that the RTX 4060 Ti didn't benefit from.

In Cyberpunk 2077, I again saw some odd results. The Radeon RX 7600 managed to perform a little better than the RTX 4060 at 1080p with FSR and DLSS off, only for the RX 7600's performance to drop like a stone when the resolution was increased to 2,560 by 1,440. This hands the advantage back to the RTX 4060, which was only highlighted further when FSR and DLSS were enabled.

The last game I tested that supports ray tracing was Guardians of the Galaxy. These results, like the synthetic tests, need to be taken with a pinch of salt, too. This game shows signs of not working correctly with some graphics cards, like the Radeon RX 7600, which turned in results here that don't match up with what we see from the card in all of the other tests. Likely, launch-time driver jitters.

Game Tests Without Ray Tracing

In games that don't support ray tracing, one of the RTX 4060's key advantages is effectively nullified. This makes for a more competitive landscape. In our first test with Total War: Three Kingdoms, I saw the RTX 4060 and the RX 7600 trade a narrow lead back and forth. The RTX 3060 was left in the dust here, but the Radeon RX 6700 XT ran ahead.

Shadow of the Tomb Raider once again showed the RTX 4060 with a clear performance advantage over the Radeon RX 7600, and it came much closer to the RX 6700 XT here than it did in Total War: Three Kingdoms. This game also gave us a brief glimpse at what the bandwidth advantage the RTX 3060 had over the RTX 4060 can do in the right situations. Though the RTX 4060 was miles ahead of the RTX 3060 at 1080p and 1440p resolutions, at 4K the RTX 4060's performance advantage narrowed. Simply put, the RTX 4060 was held back here by its limited memory bandwidth compared with the generally slower RTX 3060, which enabled the latter to almost catch up.

I saw similar results between the RTX 4060 and RTX 3060 in Far Cry 5 as well. While the RTX 4060 is undoubtedly still the faster and better card, this does suggest the RTX 4060 could perform better at 4K if it only had more memory bandwidth. It's in Far Cry 5 that I saw the Radeon RX 7600 manage to pull ahead of the RTX 4060 with a narrow lead at all three test resolutions.

Legacy Game Tests

Older game tests are more about testing a card's compatibility with older titles than gauging performance. Most cards should realistically perform better in these games than they actually do, and a performance advantage is often more representative of how well-optimized the latest drivers are for these old games.

I saw some rather mixed results here that were deeply disappointing for both AMD and Nvidia. In general, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 was faster in these tests, particularly in Sleeping Dogs. AMD clearly didn't optimize the RX 7600 driver for this game, and it showed with it losing to the RTX 4060 by the widest margin I saw in any of our tests.

Nvidia and its RTX 4060 aren't in the clear either though, as I wasn't able to run the Hitman Absolution benchmark on the RTX 4060 at 2,560 by 1,440 or at 3,840 by 2,160 pixels. The test worked just fine at 1080p, but it wouldn't start properly at the other resolutions and instead opened the test in a minimized window that never actually did anything. This all suffices to say that if you want the best performance in dated PC games, then don't sell your old hardware just yet.

Power and Thermal Tests

We test the power consumption of our GPU test bed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. As the only part that is changed between tests is the graphics card, this enables us to gain some insight into each card's power consumption.

Overall power consumption on the RTX 4060 wasn't bad, and more or less in line with the Radeon RX 7600. It was also notably better than the RTX 3060, and this taken with the increase in performance suggests a fairly significant bump in overall efficiency.

Asus, with its dual-fan thermal solution, also appears to have done an excellent job of keeping the card cool during our tests. According to Furmark's temperature gauge, after running a stress test for several minutes, the RTX 4060's temperature peaked at just 59 degrees C. I used CPUID's Hardware Monitor to check the highest temp while testing Returnal, as well, which came out slightly higher, at only 61 degrees C.

Verdict: A New 1080p Champion Rises

The 1080p graphics card market is always a piping-hot competitive space, with new and old cards alike vying for market share consistently throughout generations. Out of the new cards from AMD and Nvidia, however, the GeForce RTX 4060 takes the summit. Though the RTX 4060 Ti is clearly faster, it also costs $100 more for a performance difference that doesn't justify that price hike. The GeForce RTX 4060 is also clearly faster than the RX 7600 in most tests, and by a wide enough margin that we feel comfortable in saying that you should buy an RTX 4060 if you are trying to decide between the two.

Against older cards, the GeForce RTX 4060 is a worthy competitor too, but you have one card that's arguably a better buy in that department. Until it is discontinued, AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT will be a thorn in the RTX 4060's side. A ho-hum deal when it launched in 2021, the Radeon RX 6700 XT is available today for around $320 to $360, which, if the lower end of that range holds, makes it only slightly more expensive than the RTX 4060. In games that don't support ray tracing, it's also a decent deal faster, especially at higher resolutions. It's only in games that support ray tracing that the RTX 4060 gains the upper hand, and if F1 22 is any indication, this advantage can disappear when FSR and DLSS are enabled.

Arguably, this makes the Radeon RX 6700 XT the more appealing and more versatile option, but we see a lot of variables in the air, preventing us from definitively declaring RX 6700 XT as better than the RTX 4060. Sure, it's faster without ray tracing, but ray tracing is increasingly common in mainstream PC games now, and it overall uses last-generation tech. For playing modern ray-traced games at 1080p, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 earns our Editors' Choice award.

The two companies announced the partnership at Snowflake Summit 2023 on Monday.

""In the old days, in small data computing, you moved data to the computer,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told Reuters. ""But when you have giant amounts of data like Snowflake does, and the pile of proprietary data ... data that's so valuable to a company, then you move the compute to the data.""

In this case, Nvidia is taking a ""fairly engineering intensive"" move of embedding its NeMo platform for training and running generative AI models into the Snowflake Data Cloud, said Huang.

The partnership comes as chatbot ChatGPT has pushed many companies to find their AI strategies and has propelled Nvidia, which provides the main hardware for AI, to becoming a trillion dollar company.

""This is significant. This is the last mile that we've been waiting for 40 years,"" said Frank Slootman, Chairman and CEO of Snowflake. ""Every industry is on this. They used to say software is eating the world. Well, now data is eating software,"" he said about the importance of data today.

Slootman said companies that use Snowflake to manage their data will be able to now use their own data to train new AI models to gain an advantage in business without risking losing control of it.

No financial details of the partnership were disclosed, but Huang said Nvidia would benefit as more customers use computing for AI work.

""We sell more chips, and we have an operating system for AI called Nvidia AI Enterprise. And that operating system makes it possible for our chips to process AI,"" said Huang. Nvidia charges customers for the use of its Nvidia AI Enterprise software.

Leaks / Rumors






With the deluge of questionably-specced mid-range GPUs hitting the market, ultra-high-end SKUs have fallen out of discourse completely, save for a few murmurs about the 
Radeon RX 7950 XTX
. Rumours from earlier this year talked about the 
Titan Ada
, a colossal graphics card with a quad-slot design. 
 
and Twitter user 
@ExperteVallah
 now have new real-world images of it. 


The new photos confirm its quad-slot design, two massive fans, four vertical HDMI/DP ports and oddly-placed power connector. It looks like the render leaked by YouTuber 
Moore's Law is Dead
, with one significant difference. This has only one 12VHPWR slot instead of two. The distinct ""GeForce RTX"" etching on the side suggests Nvidia plans to use a cooler for future GeForce products.


Specs-wise, the Titan Ada was rumoured to pack a full AD102 GPU and 48 GB of VRAM, as confirmed by a recent shipping manifest. Its TDP figures ranged between 600 and 900 Watts, which reportedly 
melted some PSUs
 during testing. Nonetheless, it could lay out the groundwork for the putative 
GeForce RTX 4090 Ti
, which, at this point, like the Titan Ada, also seems like a pipe dream.

Back in May 2023, 
Nvidia
 revealed that the 16GB version of the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti GPU would be coming out sometime in July, but no exact date had been set. However, news leaks may have narrowed down the launch to mid-July.
Two reputable hardware leakers, 
hongxing2020
 and 
Zed__Wang
, report that the 16GB VRAM 
Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti
 graphics card will release on July 18. And, from what we do officially know, it will launch at an MSRP of $499 but with no Founders Edition. That's an increase of $100 over the 8GB version that came out in May.
Of course, we have yet to get the official word from Nvidia confirming this date, so make sure to take it with a pinch of salt.
Will it be worth it? 
The real question is whether the 16GB of VRAM will make that much of a difference in overall performance. On one hand, games are demanding higher specs like superior RAM and storage space, and while 8GB of VRAM is enough for most titles, some of the best PC games are beginning to require more juice than that. 
It would have been nice to have forgone the 8GB version to begin with and simply release this one at a more reasonable price point. At the very least, that would have prevented the 
supposedly flop sales
 at many major retailers around the world, even in markets that traditionally are very PC gaming-heavy.
Still, it doesn't seem like the RTX 4060 Ti has enough performance improvements to justify the higher price point. 
According to Nvidia
, the RTX 4060 Ti has a roughly 160% performance increase over the RTX 2060 Super when frame generation is enabled, but only a 60% increase over the RTX 2060 Super in titles without frame generation. And our own review revealed that the performance improvement over the RTX 3060 Ti in titles without frame generation is only 11% for both 8GB and 16GB versions of the card.
Of course, until we have the card in our hands and thoroughly benchmark it, we won't how well it'll perform. Here's hoping that Nvidia can give us another mid-range card as high-quality as the 
GeForce RTX 4060
 graphics card, which apparently features some 
truly excellent 1080p performance

This report provides an overview of the emerging open RAN PCIe-based accelerator card market based on new merchant silicon and highlights the opportunities and technical challenges facing the open RAN chip community as they strive to develop alternative chip solutions capable of efficiently processing real-time, latency-sensitive Layer-1 workloads.
 
The transition of the Radio Access Network (RAN) from a standalone, integrated network into a disaggregated, virtualized infrastructure is well underway. However, all open RAN deployments to date rely on Intel's x86-based COTS servers, with most deployments also using Intel's proprietary FlexRAN software architecture.
 
Recently, various silicon vendors have announced that they are developing alternatives to Intel's x86 platform based on ASICs, GPUs as well RISC-V architectures. Several of these vendors are currently testing their new PCIe-based L1 accelerator card products with CSPs and commercial versions of these products are expected to become widely available during the next three years.
 
Key Takeaway No. 1: Too much diversity?
 
The launch of new L1 accelerator cards from various vendors, large and small, should be welcomed by CSPs calling for diversity and will go some way to quell criticism that the open RAN market is too Intel-based. However, CSPs may now be faced with another dilemma - too much choice! They must now face the difficult challenge of testing and comparing multiple accelerator cards, inevitably involving complicated technical and commercial trade-offs.
 
Key Takeaway No. 2: Look-Aside or In-Line Accelerators?
 
At present, the choice of accelerator architecture is binary: either look-aside or inline. Both types have their advantages and drawbacks. Depending on use cases and applications, the publisher believes that operators may need to use both types of accelerators. However, only one vendor currently offers a software/silicon platform with the capability to do this.
 
Key Takeaway No. 3: Interoperability and Vendor Lock-In
 
Developing commercial-grade Layer 1 software suitable for massive MIMO networks is an expensive process requiring very specific skills and a lot of experience - but with no guarantee of commercial success. Although open RAN is designed to promote interoperability and vendor diversity, all L1 stacks are currently tied to the underlying silicon architectures and hence are not portable between hardware platforms.
 
This introduces a new form of vendor lock-in for CSPs. Clearly, there is an urgent need for an universal software abstraction layer between the L1 stack and the various hardware platforms to enable stack portability.

Clinical-stage biotech 
Recursion
 continues to go from strength to strength. After its recent 
acquisition
 of Cyclica and Valence, the company 
announced
 a partnership with—and $50 million investment from—
NVIDIA
 on Wednesday.
 
Under the agreement, the tech giant is giving Recursion a $50 million private investment in public equity. The two companies are looking to accelerate the development of Recursion's AI foundation models to help the biopharma industry create improved patient therapies more quickly.
 
'With our powerful dataset and NVIDIA's accelerated computing capabilities, we intend to create groundbreaking foundation models in biology and chemistry at a scale unlike anything that has ever been released in the biological space,' Recursion CEO Chris Gibson said in a statement.
 
Recursion has built a massive biological and chemical database via its Recursion OS, which exceeds 23 petabytes and has three trillion searchable compound and gene relationships. The company has been training machine-learning algorithms on this dataset to tackle the complex challenges of drug discovery.
 
The partnership will enable Recursion to leverage NVIDIA's 
DGX Cloud
 to accelerate its AI training, which offers AI-as-a-service software. The deal will also give Recursion access to the NVIDIA AI-stack and its software expertise to further enhance the training of its models.
 
These models will also be able to access NVIDIA's 
BioNeMo
, a cloud service for generative AI in drug discovery, which was released earlier this year. The cloud service offers tools for customization and deployment of biomolecular models through cloud APIs, which Recursion intends to support its internal pipeline with, as well as its current and future partners. Ultimately, those models can then be licensed to other biotech and pharma companies through the cloud service.
 
Wednesday's news has already paid off for Recursion shareholders. The company's shares 
jumped
 more than 80% after the announcement. Recursion's market value rose by nearly $1 billion, an all-time high for the company which was 
publicly listed
 in 2021.
 
That same year, Roche 
signed
 a potentially multi-billion dollar deal with Recursion to access the Recursion OS and Recursion Map to develop as many as 40 new medications for oncology and neuroscience. 
 
Last month, Recursion 
announced
 that one of its drug candidates was enrolled for its Phase II SYCAMORE clinical trials ahead of schedule. The company has been testing REC-994, a small molecule superoxide scavenger and therapeutic candidate for treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation, a disease that causes malformation of the brain and spinal cord. Recursion also 
has
 four other drug candidates undergoing clinical trials at various stages.
 
Tech giants like Google and NVIDIA have been teaming with biopharma companies.
 
Earlier this year, Bayer AG and Google Cloud 
announced
 a collaboration in early drug discovery using Google Cloud's Tensorflow Processing Units, which are custom-developed accelerators designed to run machine learning models and computationally-intensive workloads, to help accelerate and scale Bayer's quantum chemistry calculations.

181,DLSS 3 explained: How Nvidia's AI-infused RTX tech turbocharges PC gaming,Thiago Trevisan,2023-07-11 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html,pcworld.com,"Nvidia's DLSS 3 software is the magic that makes its latest GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs work so well. We'll tell you how to properly use this software, and the optimal settings on some of today's most popular games.","You might spend top dollar for fancy new graphics card hardware, but one of the key components to gaming performance is actually software. While the brute force of the hardware gets most of the glory (and is indeed essential), the software side is the magic that pieces it together. Without good software, even the ferocious Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is reduced to a fancy paperweight—especially when running Cyberpunk 2077 ‘s glorious new path traced Overdrive mode.

Software can also substantially improve the hardware performance. Enter Nvidia's DLSS 3.0, or Deep Learning Super Sampling. Including both AI-powered frame generation and Nvidia's wondrous latency-reducing Reflex technology, DLSS 3.0 makes for a potent recipe. And with the release of affordable new GeForce RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti graphics cards this summer, the fantastic technology is now a lot more accessible.

This isn't the same old DLSS upsampling you're used to, however. We're going to go over some basics of what DLSS 3.0 is, and its application to Nvidia's RTX 40-series GPUs. We'll let you know how to use this feature, and tell you about optimal settings on some popular supported games. Let's get cracking.

How does DLSS 3 work?

DLSS 3 greatly accelerates gaming frame rates using a mixture of AI tasks running on dedicated tensor cores. It has three components that make it tick.

Super Resolution (a.k.a. DLSS 2)

Also known as super sampling, DLSS 3's core 'upscaler' functionality is actually the DLSS 2 technology already integrated into countless games. DLSS renders game imagery at a lower resolution than your monitor runs at to increase raw gaming frame rates, then uses AI tensor cores to reconfigure the image with machine learning so that it looks sharp on your screen. This bypasses the performance penalty that your higher resolution would impose, while keeping graphics fidelity high.

Frame generation

The novel element to DLSS 3 is in the 'Optical Multiframe Generation' AI technology. After analyzing two images from a game back-to-back, DLSS 3 uses this information to insert an extra AI-created frame that does not have to be rendered by the game itself. This result is in even higher frame rates than standard DLSS 2. It can also help dramatically increase the smoothness in CPU bottlenecked games.

Nvidia Reflex low latency

The third piece of the puzzle is in Nvidia's Reflex technology. Frame generation is not free. Those AI-generated frames aren't controlled by the player, since the game isn't rendering them, so it can actually add latency (read: reduce responsiveness) in games. To combat this, Nvidia Reflex helps harmonize the GPU and CPU so that latency is reduced. It helps to bypass the traditional bottlenecks presented by both the GPU and CPU by deeper integration into the game engine itself. Reflex was created years ago to improve performance in esports games to amazing effect, but Nvidia now requires it in games that support DLSS 3.

Speaking of…

An RTX 40-series graphics card

DLSS 3 is exclusive to Nvidia's 'Ada Lovelace' RTX 40-series graphics cards. It is available for both desktop and laptop offerings, but not any RTX 30-series or prior GPUs.

Nvidia says that's because the new Lovelace GPU architecture includes more powerful AI tensor cores and, more critically, a new 'Optical Flow Accelerator' that provides scene movement info critical to creating those AI frames. Performance on RTX 30 or older GPUs would not provide a good experience, so for now this technology is limited to the more powerful hardware. Currently, six RTX 40-series graphics cards are available that meet those requirements, with a seventh coming soon:

The $1,600 RTX 4090
The $1,200 RTX 4080
The $800 RTX 4070 Ti
The $600 RTX 4070
The $399 RTX 4060 Ti 8GB or $499 RTX 4060 Ti 16GB (coming July 2023)
The $299 RTX 4060

DLSS 3 is not supported on rival AMD Radeon or Intel Arc graphics cards.

Certain Windows settings need to be active

You'll also need to turn on 'Hardware Accelerated GPU' in your Windows display settings. (Settings > System > Display > Related Sections > Graphics > Change Default Graphics Settings > Toggle Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling on)

Certain in-game settings need to be active

Only specific games directly support DLSS 3. You'll have to turn on 'Frame Generation' settings after activating DLSS upscaling. This will also necessitate 'Nvidia Reflex' being turned on, and most (but not all) games will do this by default. You'll further have the option to set Reflex to additional 'Boost.'

There are currently over 25 games that are playable now, with many more coming. High profile titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Forza Horizon 5 have recently received DLSS 3 updates, along with new releases such as Hogwarts Legacy. Rock Paper Shotgun maintains a helpful guide to all available and upcoming DLSS 3 games (they're after the ray traced and DLSS games in the list).

What are DLSS 3's drawbacks?

DLSS 3 is fantastic for increasing overall visual smoothness, but as it develops during its early days, it also has a few potential issues to be aware of.

Latency

While Nvidia Reflex addresses a lot of DLSS 3's latency concerns, it's also not the rapid response some users may expect from esports titles. That's why DLSS 3 is better suited for single player games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Plague Tale Requiem, Microsoft Flight Simulator, etc. Even with Reflex on, DLSS 3 can play a sort of trick on your mind if you're especially sensitive to how fast frame rates and responsiveness are intertwined, as PCWorld's Brad Chacos explained during his review of the RTX 4090:

'While the DLSS 3 experience shines, it doesn't always feel more responsive in your hands. Running Cyberpunk 2077 at 138fps with every possible bell and whistle active thanks to DLSS 3 looks absolutely stunning, full stop. But one of the perks of faster frame rates is increased responsiveness, and while Reflex greatly helps with that, Cyberpunk 2077 running at 138fps doesn't feel substantially more responsive than running it at the 77fps or so it hits in native 4K. Having twice as many frames looks fantastic but those AI frames aren't responding to your controls in the actual moment, though it's close.

This is not a negative. This is not a drawback. It can't be after running Flight Sim at 120fps, and Cyberpunk 2077 with ultra ray tracing at 138fps (the RTX 3090 tops out at 48fps). But it's worth highlighting.'

Visual artifacts

Most of the DLSS 3 gaming experience looks fantastic. You won't notice any visual issues or quirks. That said, there are some games that showcase some onscreen 'artifacts' or abnormalities. UI elements can also not be displayed properly in some titles, all areas that are undergoing improvement. The good news is that software updates can remedy these issues as gamers age. The Hardware Unboxed deep dive embedded below does a great job of walking through DLSS 3's visual quality, including highlighting potential quirks.

Needs powerful hardware

DLSS 3 shows some of its best results on already powerful hardware, like the Nvidia RTX 4080 or 4090. It also seems to do better when it's boosting an already-okay frame rate to a higher one, such as 60 FPS to 120 FPS. Time will tell if upcoming weaker GPUs such as the RTX 4060 will still have the same impressive results, but it should be promising.

Settings overload

Console gamers have it easy without as much customization sometimes! PC games not only have dozens of graphics settings, but it also has different levels for each one. Add to that DLSS 3, which now has its own hierarchy of graphic settings to learn.

DLSS 3 settings explained

Dozens more settings variations have entered the fray – making it confusing for gamers when choosing your graphics settings. After activating DLSS, Frame Generation, and Reflex, you have a few more choices to make.

DLSS feature options

DLSS Auto: This will try and keep the frames as best it can to your monitor's refresh rate
DLSS Quality: The best visual performance, with modest or not much FPS uplift
DLSS Balanced: A good combination of higher frames and maintaining graphical fidelity.
DLSS Performance: You'll notice somewhat less impressive visuals, but FPS frames are considerably higher.
DLSS Ultra-performance: Better FPS, but worse visuals – typically when you really want to overreach existing hardware or to hit a specific FPS at a higher resolution. (8K Gamers, you'll want to learn this one!)
DLSS Frame Generation: This setting will just be a simple 'On or Off' toggle in your game settings. Remember, you'll need Ada Lovelace RTX 40 series GPUs to work.

Nvidia Reflex and Boost

These are often found near DLSS options, but may be elsewhere in a video menu as well (as in Cyberpunk 2077). Nvidia Reflex will often be turned on automatically in most games with Frame Generation being active. That's not always true, however, and many games let you disable Reflex manually even when running DLSS 3 Frame Gen. (We don't recommend doing that.) You'll also have the option for a 'Boost' feature in many games. Reflex Boost overclocks your GPU so it can help in CPU limited scenarios even more.



To make matters a bit more complicated, some games even allow you to select only Nvidia's DLAA along with Frame Generation and Reflex. Plague Tale's Requiem is one such title. DLAA basically runs DLSS at your native monitor resolution for enhanced visual sharpness and clarity. When given this option, it offers the highest possible graphical setting you can achieve, balanced out by the obvious performance cost. You can usually choose DLSS instead if the DLAA performance is too low.

In most games, such as Hogwarts Legacy, DLAA will automatically be grayed out when you select DLSS.

Here's how we use DLSS 3 settings in our own rigs. For the most powerful hardware, such as the RTX 4080 and 4090, DLSS Quality should keep respectable frames in most games, even at 4K, and doubly so with DLSS Frame Generation enabled. If you prefer a bit more pep in performance, DLSS Balanced would be the next ideal step. You can also always just set DLSS to Auto and see if you're happy with the results, as they will vary from game-to-game.

If you have slightly less powerful hardware, such as the RTX 4070 or some mobile RTX 40 GPUs, DLSS Balanced and DLSS Performance become good settings to make sure you're hitting good frames, with the nod still going to DLSS Balanced as preferred. We'd typically recommend avoiding DLSS Ultra Performance, as it upscales from such a low resolution image that it degrades visual fidelity a noticeable amount.

Some games are just more demanding than others, so you'll be able to judge if changes are needed, especially when adding ray tracing.

Time to put this theory to practice. We're going to play some particularly intense games and see how DLSS 3 can help. These games were tested at 4K, generally with Ultra or similar max settings, and ray tracing on. The hardware is an MSI Titan GT77 laptop with a 4090 inside, which is similar to an RTX 3090 Ti desktop GPU in performance.

Keep in mind that this is at 4K, so people playing at lower resolutions such as 1440p or 1080p will always see higher FPS in general. Ray tracing also substantially lowers frame rates when on, so disabling that is another way you can achieve higher numbers. The idea with DLSS 3 is that we can have our cake and eat it too! You can experience ray tracing on Ultra, then flip on DLSS 3 to achieve better performance without compromising on other visual settings.

DLSS 3: Cyberpunk 2077

Cyberpunk 2077 has been around for a few years now, and recently it received DLSS 3 support. This game is notorious for crushing almost any GPU when ray tracing is on Ultra so it's welcomed news.

Thiago Trevisan

Let's go over how some of the settings affect the overall performance by really pushing the system. On the MSI GT77 Titan, ray tracing on Ultra without any DLSS gives us a measly 27 FPS in this portion. That frame rate is too low to actually play, so let's see how DLSS 3 can help us without having to reduce any other graphics settings.

Next, let's turn on DLSS to Balanced, but without switching on Frame Generation or Nvidia Reflex. Our frame rate jumps to 61, a much better result. The game still looks great and behaves much smoother with this extra FPS boost.

Our next option will have us once again setting DLSS to Balanced, but this time we're also going to turn on Frame Generation in the menu. Nvidia Reflex, on the adjacent 'Video' menu, will also be on. The result here is substantially better—a whopping 87 FPS. Remember that we started with just 27 FPS before turning on any DLSS features.

How does it play with DLSS 3 Frame Gen active? Quite well, actually. It feels superior in every way to native rendering, or with just regular DLSS on. The game play is smooth, and no glaringly obvious artifacts or issues present themselves. (They can still happen, however, such as UI elements being a bit quirky at times.)

The only downside here is that you're increasing latency, which is somewhat by Nvidia Reflex. The latency in this game is acceptable, as it's mostly a single player game where you're exploring and occasionally engaging in faster scenes.

A faster paced game, such as an online multiplayer esports title, is not an ideal match for DLSS 3 due to this latency factor. In Cyberpunk 2077, it works beautifully. You can also turn on Frame Generation and Reflex without DLSS, giving you FPS of around 47, but here the greater benefit seems to be pairing it with DLSS so you can achieve maximum frame rates.

In Brad Chacos' RTX 4090 desktop GPU review, we can see that even this ferocious flagship gets massive help from DLSS 3. Playing it at 4K resolution with ray tracing at Ultra pins the game to 42 FPS, but DLSS performance with Frame Generation brings it to 138 FPS. These are staggering numbers—with ray tracing still on!

DLSS 3: Hitman 3

Hitman 3 is a popular game that also taxes systems quite heavily. With ray tracing on and DLSS off, this scene gave us only around 30 FPS at maxed-out 4K settings. This game is much like Cyberpunk 2077, in the sense that it's a slower paced style game, so DLSS 3 can be a big help here.

Switching DLSS on to Balanced, but keeping Frame Generation Off, wielded 64 FPS. That's surely a significant boost, and makes the game feel tremendously more playable and smooth.

Finally, switching DLSS to Balanced, but turning on both Frame Generation and Reflex, give us truly impressiv",pcworld.com,786,news,US,en,Thiago Trevisan,https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-01-04-at-4.00.40-PM.png?w=1024,False,PCWorld,8.02729,0e5663624ad027e24b412561ec23f876,0.0,0.0,0.9912292957305908,0.8499507904052734,0.0,0.0
182,How Nvidia became a trillion-dollar company,Senior Editor,2023-07-18 00:00:00,date,https://www.cio.com/article/646471/how-nvidia-became-a-trillion-dollar-company.html,cio.com,"Nvidia's chips have evolved beyond their video game niche to power enterprise AI models, the industrial metaverse, and self-driving cars. Now the company seeks to seize the generative AI opportunity…","Nvidia's transformation from an accelerator of video games to an enabler of artificial intelligence (AI) and the industrial metaverse didn't happen overnight—but the leap in its stock market value to over a trillion dollars did.
 
It was when Nvidia reported strong results for the three months to April 30, 2023, and forecast that its sales could jump by 50% in the following fiscal quarter, that its stock market valuation soared, catapulting it into the exclusive trillion-dollar club alongside well-known tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. The once-niche chipmaker, now a Wall Street darling, was becoming a household name.
 
Investor exuberance waned later that week, dropping the chip designer out of the trillion-dollar club in short order, just as former members Meta and Tesla had fallen before it, but it was soon back in the club, and in mid-June, investment bank Morgan Stanley forecast Nvidia's value could continue to rise another 15% before the year is out.
 
Unlike most of its trillion-dollar tech cohorts, Nvidia has less consumer brand awareness to go on, making its Wall Street leap more mysterious to Main Street. How Nvidia got here and where it's going next sheds light on how the company has achieved that valuation, a story that owes a lot to the rising importance of specialty chips in business—and accelerating interest in the promise of generative AI.
 
Nvidia started out in 1993 as a fabless semiconductor firm designing graphics accelerator chips for PCs. Its founders spotted that generating 3D graphics in video games—then a fast-growing market—placed highly repetitive, math-intensive demands on PC central processing units (CPUs). They realized those calculations could be performed more rapidly in parallel by a dedicated chip rather than in series by the CPU, an insight that led to the creation of the first Nvidia GeForce graphic cards.
 
For many years, graphics drove Nvidia's business; even 30 years on, graphics cards for gaming, including the GeForce line, still account for over a third of its revenue, making it the biggest vendor of 
discrete graphics cards
 in the world. (Intel makes more graphics chips, though, because most of its CPUs ship with the company's own integrated graphics silicon.)",cio.com,1478,news,US,en,"Peter Sayer,Senior Editor,Senior Writer",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nvidia-chip-100877802-orig.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,False,CIO,10.196273,edd6970f1e819c400492cdae9f0c8583,0.0,0.0,0.9703543782234192,0.9999964237213135,0.0,0.0
183,Nvidia's Risen 286% This Year... Time To Sell?,MENAFN,2023-07-18 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106623343/Nvidias-Risen-286-This-Year-Time-To-Sell,menafn.com,learn the insider secrets of what the top hedge funds are doing today to maximize their upside and gains. Has Nvidia (NA,"Has Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) peaked?

My readers were among the first to know about nvidia before it became a superstar.

i first urged them to buy it in 2018.

Now,

everyone

knows all about Nvidia's near-monopoly on artificial intelligence (AI) chips... and folks are wondering how its stock can possibly keep rising after quadrupling in less than a year.

The funny thing is most of these folks don't understand what Nvidia actually DOES.

When you understand the simple secret of its business model, you'll see why its rise makes perfect sense...

And why, despite its stock skyrocketing over 286% in less than a year... it's actually

cheap

compared to its recent history.

Contrary to popular belief, Nvidia has never made a single chip.

Yes... it has a stranglehold on the market for high-powered, mega-expensive ai chips .

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? click here to find out .

Yes... it powers over 95% of the world's top AI systems, including ChatGPT.

But it doesn't make chips.

How is that possible?

Nvidia is an architect. It designs chips, then sends these designs to a different company, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) , to make them.

This so-called'fabless' business model was ridiculed in its early days.

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) founder Jerry Sanders insulted fabless firms, saying:'Real men have fabs.'

The'fabs' he was referring to are chip factories... and they're some of the most expensive and complex buildings on Earth.

In fact, the single most expensive factory in history belongs to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).

Taiwan Semiconductor-or TSMC for short-has made the chips inside every Apple iPhone and Mac since 2014.

And it's produced Nvidia's chips since the '90s.

My contact, John, is an engineer who fixes chipmaking machines. He told me TSMC's plant in Hsinchu, Taiwan is the most incredible building he's ever set foot inside.

Once you pass through security, you must throw on a protective coverall suit, mask, and gloves. Then, you walk into an'air shower.' It's a special chamber that blasts you with filtered air to remove any particles, like dust or hair.

The semiconductors TSMC makes are so fine, a single speck of dust can ruin them. Its'cleanroom' must be thousands of times purer than it is outside. The air is so sterile, you have to drink gallons of water to stay hydrated.

TSMC is breaking ground on two new plants in Arizona right now. Price tag: $40 billion.

To give you an idea of how expensive that really is... Los Angeles' new 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium is the most expensive arena ever built.

The construction bill totaled'just' $5 billion.

In fact, it's cheaper to build a nuclear power plant than a modern chipmaking fab.

I can't think of anything more expensive than making high-powered, cutting-edge computer chips.

The upfront costs alone are mindboggling.

And Nvidia doesn't have to directly foot any of them.

No $40 billion buildings... no cleanrooms... no air purifiers.

Instead, Nvidia effectively shoots off an email to tsmc with the chip blueprint.

TSMC makes the chips and sends them back a few months later.

They are then sold as Nvidia chips.

Nvidia's latest and greatest AI chip-the one powering ChatGPT-costs $40,000.

Nvidia gets all the benefits of the historic boom for cutting-edge AI chip demand with few of the direct costs!

As a result, Nvidia's profits have exploded higher:

And this ain't no speculative frenzy.

Nvidia's AI-related data center sales hit $4.3 billion last quarter.

And get this: AI revenues are expected to surge to $8.5 billion in the current quarter.

For perspective, it raked in $7.2 billion

total

in the first three months of the year.

In other words... Nvidia's AI arm will soon be larger than the entire rest of its business!

Now, you could make the case that Nvidia is overvalued. It's trading at 46X earnings, which is certainly not cheap.

But realize that Nvidia is trading near its cheapest forward-earnings valuation this year.

Because although its stock price has surged, its expected profits have surged even faster.

Source: Koyfin

In other words, it makes perfect sense that Nvidia is one of the best-performing stocks this year.

the ai boom is only starting.

Nvidia has a near monopoly on AI chips.

And it's likely to retain this monopoly for several years, at least.

So, what am I doing with Nvidia stock?

It's not the explosive growth opportunity it was five years ago when it was trading for one-fifth the price.

But if you're a long-term investor, I wouldn't hesitate to buy a little today. Nvidia controls the inputs to the most important investing theme of our time-AI.

Looking to solidify its position as the dominant global supplier of chips that support 
generative AI
 workoads, Nvidia announced new 
GPUs
 and servers as well as a range of new software offerings at the SIGGRAPH conference in Los Angeles this week.
On the hardware side, Nvidia announced a new line of servers, the OVX series. The server line is designed to use up to eight of the company's L40S GPUs. The GPUs are based on the company's Ada Lovelace architecture, which succeeded Ampere as the microarchitecture in use in its main line graphics cards. Each L40S packs 48GB of memory and is designed with complex AI workloads in mind, boasting 1.45 petaflops of tensor processing power.
It's similar to the approach Nvidia has taken in the past with its consumer graphics card designs, in that the company plans to sell some OVX servers directly and as reference designs, but other manufacturers (in this case, Dell, ASUS, Gigabyte, HPE, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro) will serve as global system builders. The L40S will become available in the fall, and the company said that OVX systems will go on sale soon after.
 
As part of an upgrade to its AI Enterprise software line, Nvidia also released a new product called 
AI Workbench
, which is designed to be a sort of self-assembly kit for AI developers. The system comes with pretrained models and an array of tools that can be used to customise them, with the idea of saving considerable development time.
Nvidia also announced numerous features designed to add generative AI capabilities to its other product lines, including an AI developer 'co-pilot' for its Omniverse 3D imaging software.
How Nvidia targets different sets of users
Many of the company's newest AI-related releases are targeted at different users — including cloud service providers, developers, and server makers. That's a key part of Nvidia's strategy, according to Shane Rau, research vice president at IDC.
'If the end customer's a cloud service provider, they may just want, say, a server GPU board,' he said. 'Some customers would like to buy the Nvidia silicon but also buy the whole system around it — LVX, OVX, and so on. Then maybe the next level is you buy the hardware but maybe you also need some training.'
Another important strategic point, according to Rau, is Nvidia's flexibility. That flexibility started as long ago as 2012, when the company released its first server GPUs, with the 
CUDA
 developer environment that allowed them to be reprogrammed and optimised for different tasks, and has continued with the various AI-related pieces of software that Nvidia has released. The only place, in fact, where the company tends to stop offering solutions is when it would encroach directly on an end user's own domain.
'AI can be very end-user specific,' Rau said. 'Usually the end user brings in their own expertise — agriculture, financial analysis, and so on. So Nvidia wanst to bring the level of solution that you're wiling to invest in all the way up to your specific domain, but you provide the specific expertise.'
It's been a highly successful strategy for the company in the AI market, Rau added, given that Nvidia is the largest provider of silicon for AI use by some distance.
'I'd say this was always in the cards for them,' he said.

(AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC).","Friday, August 18, 2023



The Zacks  presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's  features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock losing losing -11.6% of its value since the start of August, lagging the Zacks Tech sector's -7.3% decline and the S&P 500 index's -4.6% pullback. This recent weakness notwithstanding, the stock has been a standout performer this year, handily outperforming the Tech sector as well as the broader market.

The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, as well as the launch of its high-yield savings account with Apple Card, helped in driving subscriber growth.



Apple's results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple expects iPhone and Services' year-over-year growth to accelerate in fiscal fourth-quarter as compared with the June quarter.



However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits on a year-over-year basis due to difficult comparison. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt top-line.

As is the case with Apple, NVIDIA shares have struggled lately as well, with the stock lagging the Tech sector as well as the S&P 500 index this month (-9.4% vs. -7.3% for the Tech sector & -4.6% for the index). That said, Nvidia's performance this year is one for the record books, with the stock up +192.9% this year vs. +32.7% for the Tech sector and +15.2% for the market.

Nvidia has literally been in a league of its own since its last quarterly release on May 24th when it raised guidance by a magnitude that we have never seen from another company. With the company on deck to report results on Wednesday, August 23rd, it is under the spotlight as to whether the preceding quarter's numbers were a one-off or the start of a sustained period of outperformance.

The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues.



A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.



However, NVDA's near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and professional visualization chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.

Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-10.9% vs. -15.9%). The tough economic backdrop is expected to keep weighing on investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income. Moreover, inflationary pressure will likely result in mounting expenses.



Nevertheless, Higher interest rates and decent loan demand will likely keep aiding the company's net interest income (NII) growth. The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities is expected to bolster the top line.

crude oil confirmed it wasn't yet returning to rosy upswing days by any means – and the setback continues as the second figure given yesterday, $78.50, gets a breakdwon attempt. i'm looking at it to succeed, but this isn't the end of the crude oil run.

The Briefing

 


 
 
 






Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang should be taking notes about his daily life. This is sure to be a year he'll want to remember in detail. Nvidia's dominance of chips that are vital for generative AI is translating into growth that is extraordinary for a 30-year-old company. Not only did it report better-than-projected second-quarter revenue growth of 101% on Wednesday, Nvidia projected third-quarter revenue that would be up 170% on a year earlier. By the time the fiscal year ends next January, Nvidia should have brought in north of $50 billion in revenue, nearly double that of last fiscal year and nearly 5 times its annual revenue in fiscal 2020. 
The surge is flowing through to Nvidia's bottom line. Its net profit margin hit 46% in the quarter, compared with 10% in the year-earlier quarter. Just as a comparison, Intel hasn't reported a net margin higher than 31% in the past 32 years, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. (For more on Nvidia's quarter,

have written
 in 
the past couple of days
, the luck might not last. Developments in AI technology may give rival chips more of a chance, for instance. And most of the big tech firms, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft—all currently Nvidia customers—are developing their own AI chips to replace Nvidia's product,

Shares in Nvidia jumped 6% on the earnings and guidance, which came after the closing bell.

'Nvidia is the darling of the AI boom – of this there is no doubt – and with robust guidance we expect this to continue for most of the rest of the year,' says Nigel Green.



'For me there are two key takeaways from the Nvidia news.

'First, clearly, AI is not just the future, it's the present.



'Investors who are seriabout building their long-term wealth need exposure to this pivotal driver of innovation, competitiveness, and profitability across almost all industries.

'We're still at the beginning of the AI age and investors should not miss out on having an early advantage. Almost everyone should have investment exposure to AI as part of the mix.'

He continues:'Second, whilst we expect Nvidia to continue to dominate the ai boom for at least the rest of the year, probably more, savvy investors will now likely be thinking that perhaps a lot of the good news is already priced-in for this company.



'They will be asking: can Nvidia shares really jump another 210% over the next six months? Or are there other similar and/or better opportunities in the same arena?

'They will already be looking for The Next Big Thing – and so they should.



'Despite the fact that Nvidia is way out in front, and probably still has not peaked, history teachesthat challengers can offer potentially blowout returns for investors.'

diversification as ever is investors' best tool for long-term financial success. As a strategy, it has been proven to reduce risk, smooth-out volatility, exploit differing market conditions, maximise long-term returns and protect against unforeseen external events.

'Given the rapid evolution of AI and its investment landscape, seeking advice can minimize pitfalls, optimize opportunities, and enhance the likelihood of achieving favorable returns,' concludes Nigel Green.

here .



nvidia (nasdaq:nvda) is going to announce after the close and that's supposed to be the'grand finale' to this earnings announcement season.

their sales are forecast to be up over 60% while their earnings are forecast to be up over 300%.

the analyst revisions to the upside have been very aggressive in the past few months, so it's going to be interesting to see what nvidia says on its guidance. nvidia's

ceo

was

very upbeat after the last report and

obviously very excited that they're selling all these chips to facilitate artificial intelligence . we own a lot

of nvidia in navellier-managed accounts so we have high expectations.

the commerce department announced today that new home sales rose 4.4% in july to an annual pace of 714,000 and have risen 31.5% in the past 12 months.

the median price for new homes was $436,700 in july, while the average price was $513,000.



there is now a 7.3-month supply of new homes for sale, so builders are expected to be more cautious moving forward due to higher mortgage rates.

i should add that toll brothers (tol), which is held in navellier-managed accounts,

also announced that its revenue and earnings were respectively 8.8% and 30.4% better than analysts' consensus estimates.

meanwhile, it is clear that existing homeowners are reluctant to move and are hanging onto their low mortgage rates, so many homeowners are reluctant to move.

the national association of realtors on tuesday announced that existing home sales declined 2.2% in july to an annual pace of 4.07 million and the slowest monthly sales pace since january.

compared to july a year ago, existing home sales declined 16.6% to the slowest july monthly sales pace since 2010.



median home prices rose to $406,700 in july, which is an increase of 1.9% compared to july of 2022.

since there is only a 3.3-month supply of existing homes for sale, until mortgage rates decline, existing home sales are expected to remain lower than normal. nevertheless, i will admit that the homebuilding sector has been one of the strongest sectors this year.



crude oil prices are down today

despite the fact that crude oil inventories continue to drop but i'm not worried about energy prices.

what happened is the american petroleum institute reported the inventory drop, but it was less than expected. we're in the midst of peak seasonal demand, and after labor day, the demand should drop off and inventories might start to replenish themselves a bit.

however, in the upcoming months,

the refiners have to switch over to oxygenated winter fuels,

so the inventory of gasoline distillates might be tight. we own a lot of refinery stocks and we are

still very bullish on them.

i'm very grateful that energy stocks were zigging when my tech stocks were zagging.

the last two months have been my strongest relative performance compared to the s&p 500 since last october and

november since we have been benefitting from both ai and energy-related stocks.



so as long as you remain diversified, you can invest confidently. i should add that i do not have exposure to financial or insurance stocks that can suffer from higher interest rates as well as natural disasters, from earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and tornados.

we

have a growing ev glut in the world. tesla (nasdaq:tsla) is reducing its production at its berlin factory. they hit 5,000 vehicles a week in march, they've lowered their production target to 4,350 vehicles, and they reported they might have to lower production even further. last i looked, the inventory of the ford mach-e is around 116 days.

even

gm's hummer apparently has excess inventories. it's an extremely expensive vehicle, but gm has started to make more hummers, so i don't think they'll be able to get any premiums for them. in fact, i think when you order one, you get a discount online already.

it will be interesting to see how this ev glut affects tesla and other automakers. more than half of tesla's

production in shanghai is being exported somewhere else. the deflationary pressures in china are being exported around the globe via evs. it will

be interesting to see if other deflationary forces in china get exported. that's what i'm hoping because that's what i hope really kills inflation.

the biden administration's national security advisor, jake sullivan, on tuesday called on china to be more transparent about the state of its economy.

specifically, sullivan said'for global confidence, predictability and the capacity of the rest of the world to make sound economic decisions, it's important for china to maintain a level of transparency in the publication of its data.'

i should add that u.s. commerce secretary, gina raimondo, is scheduled to travel to china at the end of the month for high-level talks, so it will be interesting if china's economic data is discussed.

speaking of economic transparency, the labor department is expected to dramatically reduce overall u.s. payroll growth in the past 12 months.

this big payroll revision is anticipated to finally fix the bogus seasonal adjustments (like in january) as well as overstated manufacturing jobs (like in june and

july) relative to adp.



this is why i do not trust the monthly payroll reports from the labor department

since there are simply too many seasonal'fudge' factors.

ironically, the u.s. government does not have much credibility when it tells china to be more economically transparent.

If you wish to listen to this commentary, p","If you wish to listen to this commentary, please click here .

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is unquestionably the new market leader. nvidia posted massive sales and earnings surprises, of 20.9% and 29.2%, respectively, praised their guidance 37.5% above analyst estimates. Wow, I think we can all agree that AI is hotter than hot and Nvidia is the leader.

For the record, Nvidia posted a 101.6% annual sales increase ($13.51 billion vs. $6.7 billion) and a 429.4% annual earnings increase ($2.70 per share vs. 51 cents per share). I am proud that Nvidia is the largest holding in my managed accounts and that I have been recommending Nvidia for several years. After NVDA, the next leader is Super Micro Computer (SMCI).

I can tell that many investors are over-concentrated in ai stocks and do not have energy stocks. I remember telling investors that energy stocks benefit from a seasonal surge in demand in the summer months, but apparently, some did not believe me, even though this seasonal demand has happened every year I have been alive.

Energy stocks have emerged as market leaders and exhibited tremendrelative strength in August. You may be aware that I do not like August since it is a month characterized by light trading volume and some seasonal shenanigans. The latest shenanigans are'zero-day options' that can cause sharp sell-offs or short-covering rallies. Zero-day options expire the same day they are created.

Amazingly, zero-day options now account for 43% of all options, up from only 6% back in 2017. This essentially means that the'tail likes to wag the dog' as hedge funds and other active investors rush for cover. Internally, we like to call the option gyrations'Skynet' after the Terminator movies when AI takes over the world.

The last two months have been my strongest relative performance compared to the S&P 500 since last October and November since we have been benefitting from both AI and energy-related stocks. So as long as you remain diversified, you can invest confidently. I should add that I do not have exposure to financial or insurance stocks that can suffer from higher interest rates as well as natural disasters, from earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and tornados.

If you have a diversified portfolio of fundamentally superior stocks, you can invest confidently and not worry about all the distractions that can derail a fundamentally superior stock portfolio.

I should add that shipping stocks continue to perform well due to the fact that ships are at sea longer than normal. Initially, that is because energy is being shipped all over the world and the trips are longer than ever. Another glitch is the Panama Canal is suffering from a drought, so there is a big backlog since some ships have to unload some of their cargo due to low water levels.

Cargo ships have priority in the Panama Canal, which is causing ships transporting LNG and refined products to have to wait longer to travel through the canal. I should add that the Rhine River in Germany is at a seasonal low and the Mississippi River has not fully recovered from last year's low levels, so river traffic is backing up and resulting in shipping delays.

Meanwhile, the recent spike in Treasury bond yields raised fears that the U.S. may finally be borrowing more than it can afford, now that the 10-year Treasury bond has risen to as high as 4.36% intraday. Fortunately, the 10-year Treasury bond yield declined to 4.2% on Wednesday. Clearly, the $1.03 trillion Treasury refinancing this month is still having aftershocks as the realization that the interest burden on over $32 trillion in national debt may be unsustainable.

The fact that Treasury bond yields were rising as inflation cools means that demand push pressure is now effectively driving Treasury bond yields higher. The only thing that can possibly fight the Treasury limit conundrum would be market intervention and possibly more quantitative easing by the Fed. It will be interesting if this growing evidence of a Treasury limit conundrum is discussed at the Kansas City Fed Conference at Jackson Hole this week.

Speaking of Jackson Hole, Fed Chairman jerome powell on Friday is expected to outline the Fed's updated plan to tame inflation in his speech. Chairman Powell is expected to caution about easing until the Fed's 2% inflation target is achieved. The more Powell talks about the Fed being'data dependent,' the more dovish his speech will be interpreted.

Looking forward, I expect that as the U.S. imports some Chinese deflation, key interest rates will likely decline to the Fed's 2% annual target range in the upcoming months. This will allow the Fed to begin cutting key interest rates by its December FOMC meeting. I also expect further Fed cuts in early 2024.

As the Presidential election approaches, the Fed usually likes to crawl into a hole and hide, since it does not want to be part of the Presidential debates. Overall, I expect the breadth and power of the stock market to steadily improve thanks to healthy consumer spending.

The Presidential debates commenced on Wednesday. During the debate, Vivek Ramaswamy called for ending the proxy war between Ukraine and Russia, which triggered a big crowd reaction. When Chris Christie tried to defend spending money to aid Ukraine, the crowd started to boo. Clearly, the billions of dollars being sent to Ukraine while major U.S. cities decay and Maui struggles to recover is a very contentiissue.

Amazingly, the Ukraine war in the past year has cost the U.S. more in the past year than 20 years of occupation in Afghanistan. Russia has pivoted to Northeastern Ukraine and is trying to retake territory that Ukraine recaptured last fall.

Complicating matters further, the Biden Administration this week is now urging U.S. citizens to flee Belaimmediately and warned against any travel. Officially, the State Department categorized Belaas a Level 4 risk. There is also a growing chance that Russia may try to invade Ukraine via Belarus.

According to the National Consumer Panel, 41% of U.S. households purchased plant-based milk alternatives in 2022 and 76% of these customers turned out to be repeat purchasers. This is despite the fact that plant milks were on average 87% more expensive than traditional cow's milk that year.

US chip giant Nvidia, whose products play a crucial role in artificial intelligence systems, crushed expectations on Wednesday, as the post-ChatGPT AI frenzy continues to lift the tech sector.

The Silicon Valley-based company said sales doubled year-on-year to $13.5 billion in the latest completed quarter, leaving a net profit of $6.2 billion -- an eye-watering 843 percent higher than a year before.

Signaling that the boom in AI is still going strong, Nvidia said revenue in the current quarter would ramp up further to $16 billion.

""A new computing era has begun,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said after the stellar earnings report.

""Together accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad based computer industry platform shift. Our demand is tremendous,"" he said on an analyst call.

Nvidia's stock rose more than 8 percent following the results. This year, the company's share price has more than tripled.

Nvidia's quintessential position in delivering artificial intelligence has made it a bellwether on the generative AI frenzy that took hold of the tech world after the release of ChatGPT late last year.

As the wave began to build, the company already wowed Wall Street with spectacular earnings earlier in the year, helping transform Nvidia into a trillion dollar company based on market capitalization, a rare perch shared only by a handful of giants.

""The entire tech sector and overall market was waiting for Nvidia with this being the purest and best barometer for AI demand,"" said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.

In the end, the earnings ""were a 'drop the mic' moment that will have a ripple impact for the tech space for the rest of the year,"" he said.

Riding high on his success, Huang, who is known for always wearing a black leather jacket, urged companies to shift their spending away from classic computing and embrace AI.

""AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power,"" Huang said.

Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), a powerful chip technology that is necessary to build the generative AI that delivers ChatGPT as well as image, facial and speech recognition.

The company also offers AI-focused computers and services making it an unparalleled one-stop shop for AI.

Originally designed for video game graphics, each of Nvidia's GPU chips cost tens of thousands of dollars and companies are scrambling to stock up as the pressure to keep up with the AI revolution grows.

- Supply crunch? -

Customers have struggled to get their hands on Nvidia's AI chips as startups, big companies, governments and cloud providers ramp up orders and hoard stock.

Elon Musk, who this year started his own AI company, has said that GPUs ""are considerably harder to get than drugs"" at the moment, with buyers even looking to buy components from struggling cryptocurrency companies that also use GPUs.

Some fear that Nvidia may eventually struggle to meet demand with crucial components from Taiwan's TSMC chip-making plants hard pressed to meet Nvidia's needs.

Nvidia doesn't actually make its own chips, but rather designs them and then outsources the manufacturing to other companies. It is therefore vulnerable to chokepoints in its complex supply chain.

Nvidia's strategic role in AI saw the United States government last year place export restrictions on the company's highest performing chips, which forced the it to make slower versions for the Chinese market.

The White House is considering additional export curbs that could further limit Nvidia's access to the Chinese market.

In an analyst call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress warned against the US cracking down harder, saying it ""will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.""",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/23/AFP_c4bd9image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.307983,469d3ce9a3765e4d55787978771e548a,0.999893069267273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9957484602928162,0.0

he comments:'nvidia 's shares have jumped almost 210% this year on the frenzy around its uses within ai.

'clearly, this is huge and, as such, all eyes will be on the earnings and also the future guidance from the company after the bell on wednesday.

'if earnings are again stellar and guidance robust, it will help reignite the tech rally which has stalled in recent weeks. if they don't, we expect short-term market volatility.'

the devere ceo warns, however, that as the volume is getting louder, and the frenzy is reaching fever pitch regarding nvidia and other so-called 'magnificent seven' tech stocks (apple, microsoft, amazon, meta, tesla and alphabet), the heat needs to be taken down a gear.

'this level of hype is dangerous as it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth – and they are not, at least not on their own,' he warns.

'while i believe that exposure to these mega-cap tech stocks should be part of almost every investor's portfolio, as they have robust fundamentals and are future-focused, especially in ai, they should not be exclusive.'

'these stocks are incredibly important, of course, but they're not a panacea. i fear some investors will get burned unless some of the frenzy is turned down.'

'diversification is, as ever, investors' best tool for long-term financial success. as a strategy, it has been proven to reduce risk, smooth-out volatility, exploit differing market conditions, maximise long-term returns and protect against unforeseen external events.'

that said, the devere ceo remains bullish on ai-orientated investments as part of the mix.

'the buzz surrounding ai companies is grounded in tangible technological advancements and their potential to reshape industries across the board.



'the transformative capabilities of ai, coupled with its cross-industry disruption, data-driven nature, and rapid innovation, make it a compelling investment opportunity.



'as the ai market continues to expand and evolve, investors who recognise its potential are well poised to reap the rewards of this exciting technological revolution.



'including ai exposure in investment portfolios isn't just a trend – it's a strategic move that aligns with the future of innovation and economic growth. just do it judiciously.'

FTSE 100 set to have a bright Thursday

Recruitment giant Hays sees fees stagnate in UK & Ireland

WeakPMI data raises hopes that Fed tightening cycle is coming to an end

Chances of Wilko deal fade in another blow to the high street Softness in oil trading continues amid demand concerns

'Despite a very high benchmark, nvidia corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has beaten Wall Street's expectations. The artificial intelligence boom is continuing to catapult demand for the tech company's complex chips into the stratosphere, with sales of $16bn expected in the three months to October. That is streets away from analyst expectations and reflects the seemingly insatiable appetite for Nvidia's products, which are the leading option for creating AI tools like ChatGPT.

Nvidia's H100 chip, where demand is far outpacing supply, is currently selling for double its original price in the tens of thousands. Being an early beneficiary of a megatrend like AI is an enviable and rare opportunity, but bears will be arguing that at some point the valuation will start to appear full. Luckily for Nvidia, a cursory glance would suggest there aren't many bears around.

Nvidia smashing the forecast ceiling has also lifted the mood elsewhere. The ftse 100 is off to a bright start where there's little big-hitting domestic news to sway the atmosphere. Also in the UK, recruitment giant Hays has seen a sharp slowdown in the market in the UK & Ireland, where fees only rose 1% for the full year. The difficulties are largely being felt in permanent positions, in a signal that the UK's watertight labour market might be loosening.

Elsewhere,futures are in a bright mood, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 rising 0.9% and 0.5%, as they too ride the Nvidia wave. There's also growing hope that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle as weaker than expected PMI data comes through. This broader hope has also propped up trading in the UK and Asia.

High street heritage brand Wilko is closer to collapse after a deal fell through to save it. Most stores are now expected to close with large scale job losses. Despite the lower value of its products, customers haven't flocked during the cost-of-living crisis and the chain has failed to patch up damage caused by inflation and supply chain problems.

Further casualties on the high street aren't a welcome development, but they also sadly aren't a surprise given the highly difficult consumer backdrop. Images of more boarded up shops in town centres is not what communities want, and the foshould now turn to how vacant premises can be used.

brent crude prices have fallen for the fourth straight session, now at just under $83 a barrel. Business activity in thealmost stagnated in August, while the UK and Europe contracted. This creates very real questions around demand, causing the slide.'

Important Risk Disclosure
 
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or click here. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.
 
PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information)
 
You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program. The investment program of the Fund is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
 
GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. 
Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. 
The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock's performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock's performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.
 
Underlying Stock Risk: 
The Underlying Stock is subject to many risks that can negatively impact its revenue and viability including, but are not limited to price volatility risk, management risk, inflation risk, global economic risk, growth risk, supply and demand risk, operations risk, regulatory risk, environmental risk, terrorism risk and the risk of natural disasters. The Underlying Stock objectives may be affected by its ability to develop and launch new products, the growth of its sales and delivery capabilities, part supplier constraints or delays, consumer demand for electric vehicles and competition from existing and competitors. The Fund's daily returns may be affected by many factors but will depend on the performance and volatility of the Underlying Stock.
 
Derivatives Risk
: The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These risks include (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. Such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets, including, but not limited to: changing supply and demand relationships; government programs and policies; national and international political and economic events, changes in interest rates, inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships. Trading derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities.
 
For Long Funds: Leverage Risk
: The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Stock will be magnified. This means that an investment in the Fund will be reduced by an amount equal to 1.25% for every 1% daily decline in the Underlying Stock, not including the costs of financing leverage and other operating expenses, which would further reduce its value. The Fund could theoretically lose an amount greater than its net assets in the event the Underlying Stock declines more than 80%. Leverage will also have the effect of magnifying any differences in the Fund performance's correlation with the Underlying Stock
 
For Short Funds: Short Sale Risk: 
The Fund will seek inverse or 'short' exposure through financial instruments, which would cause the Fund to be exposed to certain risks associated with selling short. These risks include, under certain market conditions, an increase in the volatility and decrease in the liquidity of the instruments underlying the short position, which may lower the Fund's return, result in a loss, have the effect of limiting the Fund's ability to obtain inverse exposure through financial instruments, or require the Fund to seek inverse exposure through alternative investment strategies that may be less desirable or more costly to implement. To the extent that, at any particular point in time, the instruments underlying the short position may be thinly traded or have a limited market, including due to regulatory action, the Fund may be unable to meet its investment objective due to a lack of available securities or counterparties. During such periods, the Fund's ability to issue additional Creation Units may be adversely affected. Obtaining inverse exposure through these instruments may be considered an aggressive investment technique. Any income, dividends or payments by any assets underlying the Fund's short positions, if any, would negatively impact the Fund. The Fund could theoretically lose an amount greater than its net assets in the event the Underlying Stock increases more than 100%.
 
For Long Funds: Compounding Risk
: The Fund aims to replicate the leveraged daily returns of the Underlying Stock and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Underlying Stock's performance, before fees and expenses. Compounding affects all investments but has a more significant impact on funds that aims to replicate leverage daily returns. For a Fund aiming to replicate 1.25 times the daily performance of an Underlying Stock, if adverse daily performance of the Underlying Stock reduces the amount of a shareholder's investment, any further adverse daily performance will lead to a smaller dollar loss because the shareholder's investment had already been reduced by the prior adverse performance. Equally, however, if favorable daily performance of the Underlying Stock increases the amount of a shareholder's investment, the dollar amount lost due to future adverse performance will increase because the shareholder's investment has increased.
 
For Short Funds: Compounding Risk: 
The Fund aims to replicate the daily inverse returns of the Underlying Stock and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from Underlying Stock's performance, before fees and expenses. Compounding affects all investments but has a more significant impact on funds that aims to replicate inverse daily returns. For a Fund aiming to replicate the inverse performance of an Underlying Stock, if adverse daily performance of the Underlying Stock reduces the amount of a shareholder's investment, any further adverse daily performance will lead to a smaller dollar loss because the shareholder's investment had already been reduced by the prior adverse performance. Equally, however, if favorable daily performance of the Underlying Stock increases the amount of a shareholder's investment, the dollar amount lost due to future adverse performance will increase because the shareholder's investment has increased.
 
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.
 
A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate.
 
Because the Funds may effect redemptions principally for cash, rather than in-kind distributions, an investment in Funds' shares may be less tax efficient than investments in shares of conventional ETFs, and there may be a substantial difference in the after-tax rate of return between the Funds and conventional ETFs.
 
The Funds may engage in frequent trading of derivatives. Active and frequent trading may lead to the realization and distribution to shareholders of higher short-term capital gains, which would increase their tax liability. Frequent trading also increases transaction costs, such as commissions, which could detract from the Funds'performance.
 
The Funds are not a diversified investment, it may be more volatile than other investments.
 
This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

213,Nvidia Has Another Stellar Quarter Propelled By Ai Chip Sales,MENAFN,2023-08-25 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106950179/Nvidia-Has-Another-Stellar-Quarter-Propelled-By-Ai-Chip-Sales,menafn.com,/ins SAN FRANCI(AP) - Computer chip maker Nvidia has rocketed into the constellation of Big Tech's brightest stars while riding the,"/ins SAN FRANCI(AP) - Computer chip maker Nvidia has rocketed into the constellation of Big Tech's brightest stars while riding the artificial intelligence craze that's fueling red-hot demand for its technology.

The latest evidence of Nvidia's ascendance emerged with Wednesday's release of the company's quarterly earnings report. The results covering the May-July period exceeded Nvidia's projections for astronomical sales growth propelled by the company's specialized chips - key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, such as open ai's popular chatgpt and google's bard chatbots.

'This is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that is happening,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday during a conference call with analysts.

Nvidia's revenue for its fiscal second quarter doubled from the same time last year to $13.51 billion, culminating in a profit of $6.2 billion, or $2.48 per share, more than nine times more than the company made a year ago. Both figures were well above the projections of analysts polled by FactSet Research.

And the momentum is still building. The Santa Clara, California, company predicted its revenue for its August-October quarter will total $16 billion, nearly tripling its sales from the same time last year. Analysts had been anticipating $12.6 billion in revenue for that period encompassing Nvidia's fiscal third quarter, according to FactSet.

Nvidia's stock price surged 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out. The shares already have more than tripled so far this year, a run-up that has boosted Nvidia's market value to $1.2 trillion - a threshold that thrust the company into the tech industry's elite. If stock rises similarly during Thursday's regular trading session, it will mark yet another record high for Nvidia's shares and boost the company's market value by another $75 billion or so.

Other stalwarts that are currently or have been recently valued at $1 trillion or above are apple , Microsoft, Amazon and Google's corporate parent Alphabet.

Now all those tech giants as well as a long line of other firms are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI - a movement that's enabling cars to drive by themselves, and automating the creation of stories, art and music.

Nvidia has carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed in the AI-focused shift, partly because Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. While others were still debating the merits of AI, Huang already was looking at ways that Nvidia chipsets known as graphics processing units might be tweaked for ai-related applications to expand beyond their early inroads in video gaming.

By 2018, Huang was convinced that AI would trigger a tectonic shift in technology similar to apple's 2007 introduction of the iphone igniting a mobile computing revolution. That conclusion led Huang into what resulted in what he calls a'bet-the-company moment.' At the time Huang doubled down on AI, Nvidia's market value stood at about $120 billion.

'I think it's safe to say it was worth it to bet the company' on AI, Huang, 60, said during a presentation earlier this month.

Huang's foresight gave Nvidia a head start in designing software to complement its chips tailored for AI applications, creating'a moat' that other major chipmakers such as Intel and AMD are having trouble getting around during a period of intense demand that is expected to continue into next year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Nvidia is increasingly pitching a Lego-like combination of GPUs, memory chips and more conventional processing chips enclosed in a big package. In a demonstration earlier this month, Huang showed one such room-sized structure, joking about how it might look if delivered to a doorstep by Amazon.

'Everybody else is trying to catch them now that they see the opportunity is there.' Rasgon said.

Huang's vision has prompted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives to hail him as'the Godfather of AI,' and established him as one of the world's wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $42 billion.

While Ives still sees plenty of upside in Nvidia's future growth and stock price, other market observers believe investors are getting carried away.

'This level of hype is dangeras it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth - and they are not, at least not on their own,' warned Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/25/INS_e18d2image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.9778986,c4ddd34de57366e8478a07f8f072563d,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9999955892562866,0.0,0.0

the company reported data centre revenue of $10.32 billion, up 171 per cent from year ago.

'a new computing era has begun. companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative ai,' said jensen huang, founder and ceo of nvidia.

the company expects revenue for the next quarter to be $16 billion.

'there is tremendous demand for nvidia accelerated computing and ai platforms. our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs,' said colette kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer.

'we expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. by geography, data centre growth was strongest in the u.s. as customers direct their capital investments to ai and accelerated computing,' she informed.

consumer internet companies also drove the very strong demand for nvidia.

'their investments in data centre infrastructure purpose-built for ai are already generating significant returns. for example, meta recently highlighted that, since launching reels and ai recommendations, have driven a more than 24 per cent increase in time spent on instagram,' kress informed.

in may, nvidia temporarily became a $1 trillion company in the generative artificial intelligence (ai) tools.

high us yields threaten the attractiveness of expensive us stocks ahead of nvidia results the analysis in this article makes use of chart patterns and key support and resistance levels. for more information visit our comprehensive education library

us yields were marginally lower on tuesday but remain elevated, placing pressure on us stocks as the bond market expresses the likelihood that interest rates will need to remain higher for longer as long as usd data continues to show a phenomenal resilience. with flash pmi data due tomorrow and jackson hole on thursday and friday, this week offers very little from a scheduled risk point of view but keep an eye on nvidia earnings tomorrow after market close.

the s&p 500 rose at the open, buoyed by optimism surrounding nvidia's earnings report for the second quarter of this year. last quarter, the company beat an earnings per share (eps) estimate of 0.92, reporting $1.09 per share, sending tech stocks into a frenzy around the artificial intelligence hype.

the daily chart revealed a gap higher at the open but soon closed the gap between yesterday's close and today's open. the bearish move that ensued since printing the yearly high at 4607 in july remains in tact but has found support at 4325. the temporary reprieve form the selloff looks to 4450 as possible resistance and could see the index trading between 4325 and 4450 if market direction becomes less clear.

nvidia's results and industry guidance has great potential to extend the selloff or see the index trade back towards the high. ai and the semiconductors that support the growth of the industry have been the major driving force behind the stock market ascent this year so investors wait with bated breath.

the nasdaq rose at the open, buoyed by optimism surrounding nvidia's earnings report for the second quarter of this year. last quarter, the company beat an earnings per share (eps) estimate of 0.92, reporting $1.09 per share, sending tech stocks into a frenzy around the artificial intelligence hype.

the nasdaq chart below is similar to the s&p 500 chart, revealing a reprieve to the near-term bearish direction. unlike the s&p 500 though, the nasdaq actually traded and closed below the prior swing low at 14,687 before trading higher. today's immediate weakness after the open, signals a potential over-eagerness around nvidia in a rather quiet week. support remains at 14,687 with resistance at 15,285.

For now, as sentiments tread on some wait-and-see, the economic calendar today remains relatively quiet with US existing home sales data and Fedspeak in focus today.

For the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, recent bounce follows upon a retest of a support confluence around the 163.20 level, where its 100-day moving average (MA) stands in coincidence with the lower edge of its Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart. While much is still up in the air, any formation of a lower high from its July 2023 peak may be on the lookout, as it may point to a potential head-and-shoulder formation. The 176.34 level may be a resistance level to overcome, while for now, buyers will attempt to defend the support confluence at the 163.20 level.

Asia Open

Asian stocks look set for a mixed open, with nikkei +1.04%, asx -0.18% and KOSPI +0.67% at the time of writing, as the concentration of gains in the US tech sector overnight brought greater pull-ahead in more growth -exposed indices. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 0.8% overnight but follows after a 17% sell-off since July 2023. The Hang Seng Index continues to trade near its 8-month low, with the 17,000 level on the radar as the next line of support.

Thus far, the economic surprise index for Asia Pacific continues to hover in negative territory – a divergence from the US, which is at its highest level since March 2021. Higher sensitivity to China's economy for the region remains a drag, which could paint a low-for-longer growth outlook without signs of a turnaround in China's economy just yet.

The Straits Times Index may be on the radar, with the index paring back most of its July gains to stand less than 2% away from its year-to-date low. The year-to-date low at the 3,090 level may be a support line to hold, failure to do so may pave the way to retest the key psychological 3,000 level next. On the upside, a series of resistance will have to be overcome, which includes a previous downward trendline resistance around the 3,200 level. On the broader scale, the index remains locked within a wide consolidation zone, as prevailing weakness in manufacturing activities nullifies services sector resilience.

On the watchlist: gold prices attempting to stabilise but much awaits

Gold prices continue to hover around its five-month low, attempting to stabilise from recent sell-off despite another upmove in Treasury yields overnight. A pause in the us dollar rally may provide a catalyst for some breather, along with a reversion from near-term oversold technical conditions.

That said, there are no clear signs of a reversal yet, with the yellow metal trading below its 200-day MA for the first time this year. Its weekly RSI has also broken below the key 50 level for the first time since November 2022, which may still reflect sellers in greater control. Greater conviction for the bulls may have to come from a reclaim of its 200-day MA, while on the downside, the US$1,850 may be the next support level on the radar.

221,Nvidia's rising star gets even brighter with another stellar quarter propelled by sales of AI chips,Associated Press,2023-08-23 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/08/23/nvidias-rising-star-gets-even-brighter-with-another-stellar-quarter-propelled-by-sales-of-ai-chips,ny1.com,Computer chip maker Nvidia has rocketed into the constellation of Big Tech's brightest stars while riding the artificial intelligence craze that's fueling red-hot demand for its technology,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Computer chip maker Nvidia has rocketed into the constellation of Big Tech's brightest stars while riding the artificial intelligence craze that's fueling red-hot demand for its technology.
 
The latest evidence of Nvidia's ascendance emerged with Wednesday's release of the company's quarterly earnings report. The results covering the May-July period exceeded Nvidia's projections for astronomical sales growth propelled by the company's specialized chips — key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, such as 
Open AI's popular ChatGPT
 and 
Google's Bard
 chatbots.
 
'This is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that is happening,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday during a conference call with analysts. 
 
Nvidia's revenue for its fiscal second quarter doubled from the same time last year to $13.51 billion, culminating in a profit of $6.2 billion, or $2.48 per share, more than nine times more than the company made a year ago. Both figures were well above the projections of analysts polled by FactSet Research.
 
And the momentum is still building. The Santa Clara, California, company predicted its revenue for its August-October quarter will total $16 billion, nearly tripling its sales from the same time last year. Analysts had been anticipating $12.6 billion in revenue for that period encompassing Nvidia's fiscal third quarter, according to FactSet.
 
Nvidia's stock price surged 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out. The shares already have more than tripled so far this year, a run-up that has boosted Nvidia's market value to $1.2 trillion — a threshold that thrust the company into the tech industry's elite. If stock rises similarly during Thursday's regular trading session, it will mark yet another record high for Nvidia's shares and boost the company's market value by another $75 billion or so.
 
Other stalwarts that are currently or have been recently valued 
at $1 trillion or above are Apple
, Microsoft, Amazon and Google's corporate parent Alphabet. 
 
Now all those tech giants 
as well as a long line of other firms
 are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI — a movement that's enabling cars to drive by themselves, and automating the creation of stories, art and music.
 
Nvidia has carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed in the AI-focused shift, partly because Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. While others were still debating the merits of AI, Huang already was looking at ways that Nvidia chipsets known as graphics processing units 
might be tweaked for AI-related applications
 to expand beyond their early inroads in video gaming.
 
By 2018, Huang was convinced that AI would trigger a tectonic shift in technology similar to 
Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone
 igniting a mobile computing revolution. That conclusion led Huang into what resulted in what he calls a 'bet-the-company moment.' At the time Huang doubled down on AI, Nvidia's market value stood at about $120 billion.
 
'I think it's safe to say it was worth it to bet the company' on AI, Huang, 60, 
said during a presentation
 earlier this month.
 
Huang's foresight gave Nvidia a head start in designing software to complement its chips tailored for AI applications, creating 'a moat' that other major chipmakers such as Intel and AMD are having trouble getting around during a period of intense demand that is expected to continue into next year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Nvidia is increasingly pitching a Lego-like combination of GPUs, memory chips and more conventional processing chips enclosed in a big package. In a demonstration earlier this month, Huang showed one such room-sized structure, joking about how it might look if delivered to a doorstep by Amazon.
 
'Everybody else is trying to catch them now that they see the opportunity is there.' Rasgon said.
 
Huang's vision has prompted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives to hail him as 'the Godfather of AI,' and established him as one of the world's wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $42 billion.
 
While Ives still sees plenty of upside in Nvidia's future growth and stock price, other market observers believe investors are getting carried away.
 
'This level of hype is dangerous as it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth — and they are not, at least not on their own,' warned Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group.

France's CAC 40 edged up 0.3% in early trading to 7,261.76. Germany's DAX added 0.3% to 15,753.86. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.5% to 7,309.13. U.S. shares were set to drift higher with Dow futures up 0.3% at 34,444.00. S&P 500 futures gained 0.4% to 4,418.00. 
 
'With the Jackson Hole event just around the corner, markets are understandably lacking some conviction given the interest rate implications which could stem from this eagerly awaited get-together of central bankers,' said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. 
 
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.5% to finish at 32,010.26. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.4% to 7,148.40. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.4% to 2,505.50. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.3% to 17,845.92, while the Shanghai Composite dropped 1.3% to 3,078.40. 
 
Powell is set to speak Friday at an event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the site of several major policy announcements by the Fed. 
 
The Fed has already 
hiked its main interest rate
 to the highest level since 2001 in hopes of grinding high inflation down to a 2% target. High rates work by slowing the entire economy bluntly and hurting prices for investments.
 
Inflation has come down considerably from its peak above 9% in the summer of 2022, but economists say getting the last percentage point of improvement may be the most difficult.
 
The hope among traders is that Powell would indicate the Fed is done hiking interest rates for this cycle and that it could begin cutting them next year. But strong reports on the economy recently have hurt such hopes. A solid job market and spending by U.S. households could be feeding more fuel into pressures that push upward on inflation.
 
Robert Carnell, ING's head of research for the Asia-Pacific region, noted attention is also on what the People's Bank of China might do next on monetary policy. Earlier this month, the central bank 
unexpectedly cut a key interest rate
 in a sign of growing official urgency about shoring up economic growth. 
 
'The tug of war between markets and the PBoC will remain a focus in Asia today,' he said. 
 
Analysts say trading in Asia remains subdued as investors are also waiting for U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report later in the day. 
Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential stocks,
 swung from an early gain to a loss of 2.8% Tuesday. 
 
Nvidia has been at the center of Wall Street's frenzy around artificial intelligence technology, which investors believe will create immense profits for companies. Nvidia's stock has already more than tripled this year, and it likely faces a high bar to justify the huge move. 
 
Analysts expect Nvidia to say on Wednesday that its revenue swelled by nearly $4.5 billion to $11.19 billion during the spring from a year earlier.
 
In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude fell 37 cents to $80.35 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 50 cents to $83.53 a barrel. 
 
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 145.38 Japanese yen from 145.85 yen. The euro cost $1.0827, down from $1.0848.

market recap

market participants piled back into tech stocks overnight, as a retreat in the us 10-year treasury yields from its 16-year high eases some market anxiety for a high-for-longer rate outlook. downside surprises in us flash purchasing managers index (pmi) numbers have reflected a sharper moderation in demand for both the manufacturing (47 vs 49.3 forecast) and services (51 vs 52.2 forecast) sectors, which may challenge hawkish bets. this follows after bond yields turned lower in europe on weaker-than-expected pmi readings as well. the s&p 500 now seems to be eyeing a reclaim of its 50-day moving average (ma), which has given way just last week.

bullish bets on nvidia have also paid off. while its valuation has been lofty (price-to-sales at 45), its outperformance on all fronts continue to show no signs of slowing in growth momentum, which provides the much-needed justification. both its top and bottom-line have smashed expectations, while this quarter's revenue guidance was also revised upwards ($16 billion versus $12.61 billion consensus) – 27% higher than estimates. to top it off, the company has authorised $25 billion in share buybacks.

ahead, the next highlight on the calendar will be federal reserve chair jerome powell's speech at jackson hole, which will be due tomorrow (25 august, 10:05pm sgt). until then, sentiments may continue to bask in the us ai/tech optimism, while keeping an eye on us jobless claims and durable goods orders, where any softer read may be looked upon to further cool tightening bets.

perhaps one to watch may be the spdr s&p semiconductor etf, which has seen a bounce off a support confluence lately (ichimoku cloud support, 38.2% fibonacci level). the february 2023 high at the 210.90 level will be an immediate resistance to overcome ahead, in order to pave the way to retest the 222.64 level next. a strong positive follow-through may be needed however, given that any turn lower could still run the risks of a potential head-and-shoulder formation.

asian stocks look set for a more lukewarm open, with nikkei +0.27%, asx +0.40% and kospi +0.73% at the time of writing. a retreat in us bond yields, alongside a weaker us dollar and a sharp decline in volatility (vix -5.8%) may allow the risk environment to find some relief from recent bearish sentiments. the nasdaq golden dragon china index is up 1.5% overnight, potentially setting a more positive backdrop for chinese equities into today's session, although much await on any sustained follow-through, given the still-weak underlying fundamentals.

interest rate decision was out from the bank of korea (bok) this morning, largely meeting market expectations for further rate pause as inflation continues to moderate while growth conditions have been weaker-than-expected over the past month (downside surprises in 2q gdp, industrial output, trade activities). the day ahead is expected to see interest rate decision from bank indonesia, with a no-change in policy rate likely to be the story as well.

aside, the nikkei 225 index continues to trade within a bullish flag formation, recently finding its footing from the lower channel trendline support with some dip-buying (bullish hammer candlestick on daily chart). any subsequent break above the channel pattern may be on watch to validate buyers in greater control, with the flag formation's price target potentially leaving a retest of its all-time high at the 38,195 level on the table. on the other hand, any failure for the lower channel trendline support to hold may leave the 30,400 level on watch next.

NVIDIA ACE Adds Emotion To AI-Powered NPCs With NeMo SteerLM:

NVIDIA ACE is a custom AI model foundry that aims to bring intelligence to non-playable characters (NPCs) through AI-powered natural language interactions. With ACE, generic NPCs can be turned into interactive characters capable of striking up a conversation, or giving local knowledge that leads to new quests.

At COMPUTEX 2023, NVIDIA showed our ACE Kairos demo, featuring Jin the ramen shop owner, rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with RTX ON. In the months since, NVIDIA's team has continued to evolve ACE.

Our newest advancement is the inclusion of NVIDIA NeMo SteerLM, a new technique that enables developers to customize the personality of NPCs for more emotive, realistic and memorable interactions.

Most LLMs are designed to provide only ideal responses, free of personality or emotion, as you can see by interacting with chat bots. With the SteerLM technique, however, LLMs are trained to provide responses aligned with particular attributes, ranging from humor to creativity, to toxicity, all of which can be quickly configured through simple sliders.

226,Is Nvidia About To Crash 90%?,MENAFN,2023-09-01 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106997718/Is-Nvidia-About-To-Crash-90,menafn.com,Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)is the stock of a lifetime. It's surged 500%+since I recommended it to my readers back in 2018 . An,"It's surged 500%+

since I recommended it to my readers back in 2018 .

And it just printed the best earnings results I've ever seen. I'll tell my grandkids about how I was alive to see these numbers.

But its stock has tripled since January. And investors are asking: Is it time to take profits?

Today, I'll tell you where I see Nvidia heading over the next six months.

'Expectations.'

I've eaten in fancy, Michelin-star restaurants and walked out feeling like I got robbed.

Problem was, I expected to be blown away. And when the bar is

that

high, it's hard to top it.

My wife and I have also had dinner sitting at a plastic table in someone's back garden while their dog wandered around our feet. And the first thing I said to her when we left was,'That was incredible.'

I didn't have high hopes going in, and I was positively surprised.

Expectations shape happiness...

They drive stock prices, too.

Back in May,

artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia jumped 25% overnight

when it announced this quarter's earnings would exceed investors' wildest imaginations.

Expectations were dangerously high ahead of results. Surely, Nvidia couldn't jump over such a high bar?

Think about the best earnings you've ever seen, then 2X it. That's how sublime Nvidia's numbers were.

Its sales have doubled over the past year. Huge demand for Nvidia's AI chips from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)... Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)... and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has fueled record results.

AI chip sales surged 170% year over year. This chart shows Nvidia's INSANE growth:

Earnings were incredible,

but Nvidia's surging stock price reflects that. It's already'priced in,' as the pros say.

Investors are wondering if it's time to take profits while the going is good-before the inevitable crash.

Some folks are even calling Nvidia'the next Cisco.'

CiSystems (NASDAQ:CSCO)

connected the world to the internet. Its switches and routers allowed computers around the world to easily communicate with each other.

As businesses rushed to build websites in the '90s, they tore the hinges off the door to buy Cisco's products.

Its stock shot up 100,000% in 10 years-turning every $1,000 invested into a million dollars.

And that was the time to sell.

Cicrashed 90% during the dotbust and still hasn't eclipsed those former highs:

Despite growing revenues of 10% per year since 2000, Cisco's valuation was so out of whack back then that it may never surpass its dothighs.

Nvidia rhymes with Cisco. It's a disruptor fueling a new tech boom, handing out big gains to investors.

But our research suggests it's nowhere near the'crash' part of its story.

It's easy to forget Cihanded early investors 1,000X their money

before

plummeting.

It paid to own Ciin the'sweet spot'-the period in the mid '90s when the intewas being built out and sales were soaring.

Nvidia is in the'sweet spot' today.

World governments... trillion-dollar tech giants... and fast-growing start-ups are all scooping up every Nvidia chip they can get their hands on.

Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have already spent tens of billions of dollars on AI chips. And they've toldthey're about to buy a heck of a lot more on recent earnings calls.

Inflection AI recently raised $1.3 billion. That's a lot of dough for a start-up. Where's all the money going? It's paying for 22,000 Nvidia chips.

The governments of Saudi Arabia and the are snatching up thousands of AI chips , too.

Every company worth talking about is experimenting with AI right now. They're figuring out how to use this tech to boost their businesses and'one up' competitors.

The experiments have only begun. These companies will be on an AI chip-buying frenzy for at least another few quarters.

And that means Nvidia's stock can keep marching higher.

We're in the'sweet spot.' It's not time to sell... yet.

Nvidia expects revenues to hit $16 billion next quarter, up from $13.5 billion in Q2.

That's impressive growth... and I still think it's sandbagging.

After all, this is the same company that toldrevenues would clock in at around $11 billion this quarter... and ended up at $13.5 billion.

Our research suggests Nvidia's sales will touch $18 billion next quarter... sending its stock surging to new highs.

The AI chip-buying spree is only starting. It has at least another six months to run.

It's too early to sell Nvidia; the stock is headed higher.

But understand, this doesn't mean Nvidia will go up in a straight line. You should ALWAYS expect pullbacks.

People forget just 10 months ago, Nvidia was in a 70% drawdown and trading for $115/share!

I've owned Nvidia since 2018 and have sat through two gut-wrenching 50%+ corrections. And yet my readers who've held on since I first recommended it are sitting on 500%+ gains.

If you own Nvidia already, consider buying a little more on pullbacks. If you don't own it, it's not too late to buy... as crazy as that sounds.

Let your winners ride.

of a soft landing. While earnings season had a lot of'beats' they were mostly drops y-o-y, with the rationale that 2Q23 was the low for earnings, with strong growth still projected in the quarters ahead to support the relatively high P/E multiples.

This morning, stocks popped as interest rates fell on a surprisingly light JOLTS job opening number. Long yields fell 6bps on the news, on hopes that signs of weakness will temper the chance of a Fed rise in September. After a hesitation, the 2yr dropped 10bps to 4.90% and really got

stocks moving.

Today also saw theRedbook rise to the highest since February, after spending July in the negative zone, a positive

sign of consumer spending which has been under a cloud during earnings season. Other data showed the rise in the House Price Index, a bit surprising given the high mortgage rates, and may act to keep upward pressure on rental rates, a very large component of CPI.

As stocks moved up in the first hour of trading, tech is leading again, the QQQ and NASDAQ well ahead of the S&P and Dow with the Magnificent Seven mega techs, rebounding nicely. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has finally gotten legs; after opening down $3 it has swung to up

+$15, taking the semiconductor group along for the ride.

The VIX continues to fall as it has since mid-month. International stocks are having a good day, importantly China, with the Hang Seng up almost 2%, coming off its low for the year this week, though still down 8.25% YTD.

Stocks are staging a very nice rebound off the August lows and give hope that the weak seasonality of late summer won't be repeated in September.

Investors are ready to put A","Friday's rebound continues on the open. Investors are ready to put August behind them.

The market is trying to find new leadership, as tech has taken a body blow when NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares lost momentum in the face of stellar earnings and guidance, raising questions about the vulnerability of the rest of megatech, which has delivered 75% of the NASDAQ return this year.

Tech is down 5% in August, which is still better than the banks which are down 9%, both impacted by the steady rise in interest rates as the yield curve capitulates to the Fed's higher for longer, with the latest estimates for a Fed cut now kicked well into 2024.

The competition for investor money from fixed income is getting stronger, not only with short rates well above 5%, but longer rates are seeing more recommendations for Corporate bonds and High Yield, helped by stronger economic data. So far we're seeing a normal seasonal pullback with light volume and tame volatility.

China is adding incremental support to its weaker-than-expected economy and is bouncing today, helping push crude oil back over $80/bbl, aided by expectations that the Saudis will push the 1MM/bbl volume cut through October.

We get a few interesting earnings this week: Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), NOI (NYSE:NIO), and HP (NYSE:HPQ) tomorrow, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) on Wednesday, and Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Broa(NASDAQ:AVGO), and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) on Thursday.

After the first two hours of trading, all the major indexes are at the high for the day, and the VIX is falling, with communication services and energy leading. We should be having noticeably less volatility this week with no Fed news expected, the NVIDIA report behind us, and a long weekend ahead.

artificial-intelligence chips beyond China to other countries including in the Middle East.

The curbs will affect Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine-learning tasks, Nvidia said the curbs would not have an'immediate material impact' on its results.

''For now, these latest restrictions are set to at most be a brief glancing blow for the King of AI, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Such is the insatiable demand for their complex AI chips around the world to power the machine learning revolution, they are not going to be short of customers. There are concerns that the companies won't be able to keep up with the current clamour for orders due to supply constraints of key components.

Demand has been far outpacing supply for Nvidia's H100 chip, which is subject to these latest restrictions, and it's been selling for double its original price.

Being ahead of the curve of a megatrend is a rare opportunity and Nvidia in particular has a front seat on the AI juggernaut. Companies don't want to be left behind in the AI revolution, and even though times are tighter, they are ringfencing budgets to invest in future AI capabilities.

But there is the potential for others to catch up and gain a bigger slice of the market. So, over the longer term, if these restrictions stay in force, they could open the door to an easier run for other start-ups with eyes on the AI prize. Already the ban on the sale of some of Nvidia and AMD's chips in China appears to have helped propel progress for new domestic chip developers, particularly Shanghai Biren Intelligent Technologywhich is focusing on selling its BR100 chip to private data centre and cloud customers.

Whether it can build an eco-system with a software platform to get anywhere close to rivalling Nvidia is far from clear but as we've seen there has been huge leaps in AI development in a short space of time, so the incumbents don't have room to be complacent.''

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.32% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 31, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.32% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 31, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The 10 most popular stocks returned an average of 68.6% since the start of 2023, returning £1,686 if £100 had been invested in each. A fictitiinvestment of £100 in each of the top 10 stocks earned £649 more in profit than if £1000 was placed in a savings account.

19 September 2023, LONDON – Research by price comparison website finder, analysed the performance of the 10 most popular stocks in a live chart to find out which company has performed the best since the start of 2023.

As of 15 September 2023, NVIDIA's share price has more than tripled, with a fictitiinvestment of £1,000 at the start of the year returning £3,067 after 177 market days.



The recent success seen by NVIDIA is likely due to the continued buzz around AI in the mainstream media. The California tech giant has been firmly in the top 3 since the start of 2023 and has been leading the other stocks since 28 April 2023, for the past 96 market days.

While NVIDIA is dominating the most popular stocks, those investing in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) would also have seen substantial returns in 2023. The value of each stock has more than doubled, with Tesla up 154% and Meta up 141% on 15 September 2023.

A fictional investment of £1000 in Tesla would have returned £2,538, while a fictional investment of £1,000 in Meta returned £2,407.

Finder's investment tracker shows that all but two of the 10 most popular stocks would have given positive returns so far in 2023, with an average of 68.6%. If someone had placed £100 in each of the top stocks at the start of 2023, they would have made gains of £686 on their initial investment on 15 September 2023.

To compare, if someone had placed £1,000 in an easy access savings account with an interest rate of 5.12% at the start of 2023, they would have made gains of just £37 by the same date, which is a significant difference of £649.

It is important to keep in mind that investing is far more volatile and your capital is at risk, so you may get back less than you invested. However, it is interesting to see the fictional difference between saving and investing.



Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out .

All but two of the 10 most popular stocks have given positive returns. Of those that have decreased in value, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) was down by 13.9% on 15 September, while Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) was down by 5.3%.

Follow the live chart to see what a fictitiinvestment of £1,000 at the start of 2023 would have returned.

George Sweeney, investing expert at finder, comments on NVIDIA's hype:

'AI has been a hot topic in the media in 2023, giving the whole market a much-needed boost, and encouraging investor confidence globally. Many investing in the stock market have been trying to profit from the latest developments in AI by investing in firms like NVIDIA. However, the current share price is relatively high compared to revenue and income, with high growth multiples already priced in - perhaps indicating a potential bubble'.

'Although the future looks bright for the AI sector, investors must be careful when investing in sectors in relative infancy. There's no guarantee new tech will remain highly profitable as it matures. It's always important to look at the long-term picture and dig into the financials before investing in popular stocks to avoid unrealistic expectations'

262,Bearish On Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Before Earnings? Check Out This Unique ETF,MENAFN,2023-09-26 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107141710/Bearish-On-Nvidia-NASDAQ-NVDA-Before-Earnings-Check-Out-This-Unique-ETF,menafn.com,"--news direct--by rachael green, benzinga nvidia corporation (nasdaq: nvda) seems to have become something of a bellwether","by rachael green, benzinga

nvidia corporation (nasdaq: nvda) seems to have become something of a bellwether of the larger ai industry. the chipmaker makes the graphics processing units (gpus) that well-known ai tech like chatgpt use to run, and the company is widely expected to cash in on the emerging technology. as a result, nvda shares have been trending up since the fall of last year and are currently up more than 200% year-to-date.

but some investors aren't convinced the stock can keep up this momentum indefinitely – at least not without some bumps in the road. for those who may see a bubble, those bumps could translate into profitable trades if played right. here are a few reasons some traders are bearish on nvda.

while few are questioning the demand for nvidia's gpus, rumors of a looming gpu shortage could inadvertently have a snowball effect on new ai research. ai technology takes a significant amount of time and money to develop. the hardware, the massive quantities of data, and the specialized expertise needed to create ai that lives up to the hype don't come cheap-and then there's the sunk time in developing and training the ai that could have been spent on r&d with a little more certainty.

so if developers can't be reasonably certain that the gpus they need will even be available, some companies might decide to hold off on their ai projects until supply is a little more stable.

right now, nvda's growth has a lot of future revenue potential built into it so news that the chip maker might not be able to scale production fast enough to make enough chips to meet rising revenue forecasts could be enough to push shares down at least temporarily.

nvidia seems to be dominating the ai space right now, but it's far from the only chip maker in the game. some of its most-watched competitors include advanced micro devices (nasdaq: amd), intel (nasdaq: intc), cerebras, and alphabet (nasdaq: googl). if nvidia faces a hiccup in production as it tries to scale production to meet this unprecedented demand, that could open the door just enough for these competitors to gain a foothold in the market.

amd is developing a family of chips that will compete with nvidia on performance. unlike nvidia, amd also offers an open software ecosystem called rocm, giving developers a lower-cost, more flexible entry point into ai development. this could make it a key competitor among smaller developers and startups in particular.

intel, on the other hand, is already one of nvidia's strongest chip-making competitors though it's still lagging behind nvidia when it comes to gpus specialized for ai. intel acquired habana in 2019, getting the israel-based developer's line of gaudi ai chips as part of the deal. so far, the gaudi chips aren't as fast as nvidia's latest gpus, but they are competitive on price and do offer enough performance for some lighter-duty ai tasks. the company is also working on sapphire rapids, a server cpu with built-in accelerators to handle generative ai.

nvidia might have the edge now while it's the only major player in the game, but as these competitor products roll out, it's going to get harder for the chip maker to hold onto its lead-especially if it's already struggling to scale production.

for investors who are near-term bearish on nvidia or are looking for a short-term hedge on their existing long position, consider using the axs 1.25x nvda bear daily etf (nvds) .

nvds is a leveraged etf designed by axs investments to seek 125% of the inverse of nvda's daily performance. this leverage can help magnify the performance of each trade so that even smaller, short-lived dips have the potential to generate meaningful gains for traders. use of this etf also avoids having to source a borrow on nvda from your broker which can be a hassle at times.

at the same time, leveraged etfs do come with additional risk and nvds is not intended to be held for longer than a day. so it's especially important that traders do their research and understand how to incorporate the leveraged etf into their overall trading strategy. but when used carefully, nvds could be a great tool for turning your bearish assumptions about nvidia into potential yield.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, France's competition authority specifically targeted Nvidia as its chip business grew manifold.

While the French agency did not mention Nvidia by name, it confirmed it carried out a raid over concerns about anti-competitive practices in the graphics cards industry.

'Following authorisation from a liberty and custody judge, the investigation services of the Autorite de la concurrence carried out a dawn raid at the premises of a company suspected of having implemented anticompetitive practices in the graphics cards sector,' the French regulator said in a statement.

'Such dawn raids do not pre-suppose the existence of a breach of the law which could be imputed to the company involved in the alleged practices, which only a full investigation into the merits of the case could establish, if appropriate,' it added.

Nvidia was yet to comment on the WSJ report. France's competition authority has expressed concerns that established companies in the sector could harm smaller firms in the sector.

'Several companies, including Microsoft and OpenAI, have purchased thousands of the company's high-end AI chips to power large language models,' the report mentioned.

Nvidia reported a record quarterly revenue of $13.51 billion in its latest report, a 101 per cent increase from the year-ago period.

Nvidia's valuation also briefly crossed the trillion-dollar mark in May as a result of the AI boom.

According to the WSJ, these types of raids occur early in the morning and have authorities'search a company's premises, seize physical and digital materials and interview employees who arrive for work'.

The French authority said it conducted the raid as part of its increased scrutiny on cloud technology.

'At the forefront of the AI craze, Nvidia has become a bellwether for both the semiconductor space and broader technology sector,' said Direxion Managing Director and Head of Distribution and Alternatives, Edward Egilinsky.'The ability to trade NVDU or NVDD is one way for traders to respond tactically to potential company events and market sentiment, regardless of the stock's direction.'

As ground-breaking products built for active traders, Direxion's pairs of single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs are meant to be used for short-term trading purposes. Leveraged and inverse single stock ETFs should not be viewed as buy and hold investments, but rather trading tools for traders with a high risk tolerance. In addition, unlike traditional ETFs, or even other levered and/or inverse ETFs, these ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification.

""As the AI sector continues to drive tech markets, we felt now was the ideal time to launch the NVDU and NVDD pair to serve as valuable tools for traders navigating this volatile market,' Egilinsky added.'Since the approval and launch of Direxion's suite of single-stock ETFs, the interest in these trading products continues to grow. This new pair is an exciting game changer for those who want to take more risk on the AI trade.'

All Direxion leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. Please visit the Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center , where you will find educational brochures, videos, and a self-paced online course to help you understand if leveraged ETFs are right for you.

An investor should carefully consider a Fund's investment objective, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. A Fund's prospecand summary prospeccontain this and other information about the Direxion Shares. To obtain a prospecand summary prospeccall 866-476-7523 or visit our website at direxion.com. A Fund's prospecand summary prospecshould be read carefully before investing.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock's performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock's performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock's performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock's performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his or her investment in a single day. Investing in the Funds is not the same as investing directly in NVDA.

Semiconductor Industry Risk – Semiconductor companies may face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, and such competition may have an adverse effect on such companies' profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Companies in the semiconductor industry may have products that face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel.

NVIDIA Corporation Investing Risk - NVIDIA Corporation faces risks associated with meeting the evolving needs of its large markets – gaming, data center, professional visualization and automotive – and identifying new products, services and technologies; competition in its current and target markets; changes in customer demand; supply chain issues; manufacturing delays; potential significant mismatches between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excessive inventory; the dependence on third-parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design its products which reduces control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules; significant product defects; international operations, including adverse economic conditions; impacts from climate change, including water and energy availability; business investment and acquisitions; system security and data protection breaches, including cyberattacks; business disruptions; a limited number of customers; the ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees; the proper function of its business processes and information systems; impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic; its intellectual property; and other regulatory, and legal issues.

Direxion Shares Risks - An investment in each Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund's investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning. Risks of the Funds include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Leverage Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Correlation Risk, NVIDIA Corporation Investing Risk, Market Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Cash Transaction Risk, Tax Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, Trading Halt Risk, and risks specific to the technology sector and semiconductor industry. Additional risks include, for the Direxion Daily NVDA Bear 1X Shares, risks related to Shorting. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Funds.

The research framework includes four parts: GPU rendering program integration, data collection, program analysis, and similarity analysis. In the program integration and data collection phase, 1000 GPU rendering programs were collected from open-source repositories, and 100 representative programs were selected as the initial benchmark dataset. The program analysis phase involves instruction-level, thread-level, and memory-level analysis, as well as five machine learning algorithms for importance ranking. Finally, through Pearson similarity analysis, rendering programs with high similarity were eliminated, and the final GPU rendering program benchmark dataset was selected based on the benchmark's comprehensiveness and representativeness. The experimental results of this study show that, due to the need to load and process texture and geometry data in rendering programs, the average global memory access efficiency is generally lower compared to the averages of the Rodinia and Parboil benchmarks. The GPU occupancy rate is related to the computationally intensive tasks of rendering programs. The efficiency of stream processor execution and thread bundle execution is influenced by branch statements and conditional judgments. Common operations such as lighting calculations and texture sampling in rendering programs require branch judgments, which reduce the execution efficiency. Bandwidth utilization is improved because rendering programs reduce frequent memory access and data transfer to the main memory through data caching and reuse. Furthermore, this study used multiple machine learning methods to rank the importance of 160 characteristics of 100 rendering programs on four different NVIDIA GPUs. Different methods demonstrate robustness and stability when facing different data distributions and characteristic relationships. By comparing the results of multiple methods, biases inherent to individual methods can be reduced, thus enhancing the reliability of the results. The contribution of this study lies in the analysis of workload characteristics of rendering programs, enabling targeted performance optimization to improve the efficiency and quality of rendering programs. By comprehensively collecting GPU rendering program data and performing characteristic analysis and importance ranking using machine learning methods, reliable reference guidelines are provided for GPU design.

Foxconn will integrate Nvidia technology to develop a new class of data centers powering a wide range of applications - including digitalisation of manufacturing and inspection workflows, development of AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, and a growing number of language-based generative AI services.

'Most importantly, Nvidia and Foxconn are building these factories together. We will be helping the whole industry move much faster into the new AI era,' said Foxconn Chairman and CEO, Young Liu.

Huang said that a new type of manufacturing has emerged - the production of intelligence.

'And the data centres that produce it are AI factories. Foxconn, the world's largest manufacturer, has the expertise and scale to build AI factories globally. We are delighted to expand our decade-long partnership with Foxconn to accelerate the AI industrial revolution,' he added at the fourth annual Hon Hai Tech Day in Taiwan.

Working closely with Nvidia, Foxconn is expected to build a large number of systems based on Nvidia CPUs, GPUs and networking for its global customer base, which is looking to create and operate their own AI factories, optimised with Nvidia AI Enterprise software.

An AI factory with these Nvidia platforms can give Foxconn the ability to accomplish AI training and inference, enhance factory workflows and run simulations in the virtual world before deployment in the physical world.

Simulating the entire robotics and automation pipeline from end to end provides Foxconn with a path to operational efficiency gains, saving time and costs.

Huang joined Liu to also unveil the latest in their ongoing partnership to develop the next wave of intelligent electric vehicle (EV) platforms for the global automotive market.

Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn and US hardware leader Nvidia said Wednesday they would team up to create ""AI factories"", powerful data processing centres that would drive the manufacturing of next-generation products such as electric cars.

The world's largest contract electronics maker, Foxconn -- officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group -- already plays a lynchpin role in assembling gadgets for top global brands, including Apple's iPhone.

But it has ambitions to diversify beyond electronics assembly -- even embracing the competitive but rapidly expanding electric vehicle business by unveiling concept cars on its ""Hon Hai Tech Day"" in past years.

This year, chairman Young Liu opened the annual event with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang to introduce a ""new class of data centres powering a wide range of applications"".

Silicon Valley-based Nvidia made its name developing graphics processing units (GPUs), a powerful chip technology that started as the backbone of modern video games -- but has now become a crucial pillar in the rapid development of generative AI.

""Together we will be helping the whole industry move much faster into the new AI era,"" Liu announced onstage with Huang.

The ""factories"" would include ""digitalisation of manufacturing and inspection workflows, development of AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, and a growing number of language-based generative AI services"", according to Nvidia.

Huang said Foxconn ""has the expertise and scale to build AI factories globally"".

If successful, Foxconn's customers could use these systems to deliver generative AI services and use simulation to train autonomous machines like industrial robots and self-driving cars.

The announcement Wednesday came a day after the United States unveiled tightening curbs on exports of state-of-the-art chips to China -- the latest move to prevent Beijing's advances in cutting-edge tech, seen by Washington as a national security threat.

The ban would hit Nvidia's chips that had previously gone to China -- a major supplier base for many contract electronics manufacturers, including Foxconn -- and sent the company's share price plummeting on Wall Street on Tuesday.

The US is restricting the sale of chips that Nvidia Corp. designed specifically for the Chinese market, part of sweeping new updates to export curbs that are designed to block China's access to highly advanced semiconductor technology.
 
The tighter controls will target Nvidia's A800 and H800 chips, a senior US official said, which the American firm created for export to the Asian country after the Biden administration introduced its initial restrictions last October. Those curbs, including the updated rules released Tuesday, aim to prevent China from accessing cutting-edge technology with military uses.
 
Nvidia Corp. shares were down 5.6% at 10:14 a.m. New York time.
 
The new rules also require companies to notify the US government before selling chips that fall below the controlled threshold, as Bloomberg reported earlier. Top-of-the-line chips are best for powering artificial intelligence models, a senior administration official said. But with a lot of money and a little jury-rigging, a whole class of slightly inferior chips could also be used for AI and supercomputing and therefore pose a national security risk, the official said.
 
'We comply with all applicable regulations while working to provide products that support thousands of applications across many different industries,' a Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement. 'Given the demand worldwide for our products, we don't expect a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results.'
 
The US wants to monitor that so-called gray zone activity, the official added, while declining to comment on the specific parameters of which chips will be affected. The administration will review company notifications within 25 days, the official said, to determine whether firms need a license to sell those chips to China.
 
'It's difficult to draw a bright line between military and commercial technology,' US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters ahead of publication of the rule. 'There are often dual-use technologies — and the same technologies that fuel commercial exchange, unfortunately, sometimes can also allow our competitors to modernize their military, surveil their citizens and solidify oppression.'
 
But the US doesn't want to be more restrictive than necessary, Raimondo said, emphasizing a consistent message from the Biden administration that Washington doesn't seek to hurt China's economy.
 
As part of the China curbs announced on Tuesday, the Biden administration also included two Chinese AI chip startups and their subsidiaries on a trade restriction list that mandates companies to obtain a US government license before shipping to those firms. Shanghai Biren Intelligent Technology Co. and Moore Threads Intelligent Technology Beijing Co. are considered to be two potential Chinese rivals to Nvidia.
 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Monday at a regular press briefing in Beijing that her nation opposed 'the US politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues.'
 
Washington relented in one key area following a year of public comment on the initial rule: The updated curbs broadly allow the sale of advanced commercial chips to Chinese companies for use in consumer products like smartphones, computers and electric vehicles, as Bloomberg reported earlier. But the Biden administration will restrict the most advanced consumer chips — like those used in AI data centers — and impose a notification process on a select number of varieties just behind the cutting edge.
 
The administration will also require firms to obtain a license to sell chips to more than 40 countries that Chinese firms could use as intermediaries to skirt US controls.
 
The  is also expanding the scope of manufacturing gear subject to restrictions, said senior administration officials, without specifying the exact equipment. Asked whether the US would restrict less advanced DUV machines, which are mainly supplied by Dutch chip equipment leader ASML Holding NV, an administration official said that Washington has worked with the Netherlands on the policy.
 
ASML's chief executive officer publicly opposed the initial US restrictions, and it took months before the US was able to get its key allies in Amsterdam and Tokyo on board.
 
'Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the  semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere,' said industry group Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents Nvidia and major  equipment suppliers including Applied Materials Inc.
 
'Accordingly, we urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies,' the group added.
 
The updated rules won't include restrictions on access to US or allied cloud computing services, though the administration will issue a request for comment to better understand potential national security risks associated with this access — and options to potentially address them.

October 23, 2023 by David Edwards Leave a Comment

Powerful generative AI models and cloud-native APIs and microservices are coming to the edge, according to Nvidia

Generative AI is bringing the power of transformer models and large language models to virtually every industry. That reach now includes areas that touch edge, robotics and logistics systems: defect detection, real-time asset tracking, autonomous planning and navigation, human-robot interactions and more.

Nvidia has rolled out'major expansions' to two frameworks on the Nvidia Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics: the Nvidia Isaac ROS robotics framework has entered general availability, and the Nvidia Metropolis expansion on Jetson is coming next.

To accelerate AI application development and deployments at the edge, Nvidia has also created a Jetson Generative AI Lab for developers to use with the latest open-source generative AI models.

More than 1.2 million developers and over 10,000 customers have chosen Nvidia AI and the Jetson platform, including Amazon Web Services, Cisco, John Deere, Medtronic, Pepsico and Siemens.

With the rapidly evolving AI landscape addressing increasingly complicated scenarios, developers are being challenged by longer development cycles to build AI applications for the edge.

Reprogramming robots and AI systems on the fly to meet changing environments, manufacturing lines and automation needs of customers is time-consuming and requires expert skills.

Generative AI offers zero-shot learning – the ability for a model to recognize things specifically unseen before in training – with a natural language interface to simplify the development, deployment and management of AI at the edge.

Transforming the AI Landscape

Generative AI dramatically improves ease of use by understanding human language prompts to make model changes. Those AI models are more flexible in detecting, segmenting, tracking, searching and even reprogramming – and help outperform traditional convolutional neural network-based models.

Generative AI is expected to add $10.5 billion in revenue for manufacturing operations worldwide by 2033, according to ABI Research.

'Generative AI will significantly accelerate deployments of AI at the edge with better generalization, ease of use and higher accuracy than previously possible,' said Deepu Talla, vice president of embedded and edge computing at Nvidia.

'This largest-ever software expansion of our Metropolis and Isaac frameworks on Jetson, combined with the power of transformer models and generative AI, addresses this need.'

Developing with generative AI at the Edge

The Jetson Generative AI Lab provides developers access to optimized tools and tutorials for deploying open-source LLMs, diffusion models to generate stunning interactive images, vision language models (VLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) that combine vision AI and natural language processing to provide comprehensive understanding of the scene.

Developers can also use the Nvidia TAO Toolkit to create efficient and accurate AI models for edge applications. TAO provides a low-code interface to fine-tune and optimize vision AI models, including ViT and vision foundational models.

They can also customize and fine-tune foundational models like Nvidia NV-DINOv2 or public models like OpenCLIP to create highly accurate vision AI models with very little data. TAO additionally now includes VisualChangeNet, a new transformer-based model for defect inspection.

Harnessing new Metropolis and Isaac Frameworks

Nvidia Metropolis makes it easier and more cost-effective for enterprises to embrace world-class, vision AI-enabled solutions to improve critical operational efficiency and safety problems.

The platform brings a collection of powerful application programming interfaces and microservices for developers to quickly develop complex vision-based applications.

More than 1,000 companies, including BMW Group, Pepsico, Kroger, Tyson Foods, Infosys and Siemens, are using Nvidia Metropolis developer tools to solve Internet of Things, sensor processing and operational challenges with vision AI – and the rate of adoption is quickening.

The tools have now been downloaded over 1 million times by those looking to build vision AI applications.

To help developers quickly build and deploy scalable vision AI applications, an expanded set of Metropolis APIs and microservices on Nvidia Jetson will be available by year's end.

Hundreds of customers use the Nvidia Isaac platform to develop high-performance robotics solutions across diverse domains, including agriculture, warehouse automation, last-mile delivery and service robotics, among others.

At ROSCon 2023, Nvidia announced major improvements to perception and simulation capabilities with new releases of Isaac ROS and Isaac Sim software.

Built on the widely adopted open-source Robot Operating System (ROS), Isaac ROS brings perception to automation, giving eyes and ears to the things that move.

By harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated GEMs, including visual odometry, depth perception, 3D scene reconstruction, localization and planning, robotics developers gain the tools needed to swiftly engineer robotic solutions tailored for a diverse range of applications.

With the general availability of the latest Isaac ROS 2.0 release, developers can now create and bring high-performance robotics solutions to market with Jetson.

'ROS continues to grow and evolve to provide open-source software for the whole robotics community,' said Geoff Biggs, CTO of the Open Source Robotics Foundation.

'Nvidia's new prebuilt ROS 2 packages, launched with this release, will accelerate that growth by making ROS 2 readily available to the vast Nvidia Jetson developer community.'

Delivering New Reference AI Workflows

Developing a production-ready AI solution entails optimizing the development and training of AI models tailored to specific use cases, implementing robust security features on the platform, orchestrating the application, managing fleets, establishing seamless edge-to-cloud communication and more.

Nvidia announced a curated collection of AI reference workflows based on Metropolis and Isaac frameworks that enable developers to quickly adopt the entire workflow or selectively integrate individual components, resulting in substantial reductions in both development time and cost.

The three distinct AI workflows include: Network Video Recording, Automatic Optical Inspection and Autonomous Mobile Robot.

'Nvidia Jetson, with its broad and diverse user base and partner ecosystem, has helped drive a revolution in robotics and AI at the edge,' said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.

'As application requirements become increasingly complex, we need a foundational shift to platforms that simplify and accelerate the creation of edge deployments. This significant software expansion by Nvidia gives developers access to new multi-sensor models and generative AI capabilities.'

More Coming on the Horizon

Nvidia announced a collection of system services which are fundamental capabilities that every developer requires when building edge AI solutions.

These services will simplify integration into workflows and spare developer the arduous task of building them from the ground up.

The new Nvidia JetPack 6, expected to be available by year's end, will empower AI developers to stay at the cutting edge of computing without the need for a full Jetson Linux upgrade, substantially expediting development timelines and liberating them from Jetson Linux dependencies.

JetPack 6 will also use the collaborative efforts with Linux distribution partners to expand the horizon of Linux-based distribution choices, including Canonical's Optimized and Certified Ubuntu, Wind River Linux, Concurrent Real-Time Redhawk Linux and various Yocto-based distributions.

Partner ecosystem

The Jetson partner ecosystem provides a wide range of support, from hardware, AI software and application design services to sensors, connectivity and developer tools.

These Nvidia Partner Network innovators play a vital role in providing the building blocks and sub-systems for many products sold on the market.

The latest release allows Jetson partners to accelerate their time to market and expand their customer base by adopting AI with increased performance and capabilities.

Independent software vendor partners will also be able to expand their offerings for Jetson.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/23/R&AN_ae07bimage_story.png,False,@menafn,8.878211,044e36e6125fa7789f6cff6f0c566a1f,0.9999961853027344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5992003083229065

This directive comes following the US Department of Commerce's release of new semiconductor export restrictions, which involve stricter definitions for advanced AI chips and additional licensing requirements as precautionary measures.



These export restrictions were set to take effect 30 days after the announcement on October 17 by the administration of US President Joe Biden, which aimed to prevent countries like China, Iran, and Russia from obtaining advanced AI chips developed by US companies. However, Nvidia received notification from Washington on Monday that these export restrictions should be applied retroactively to that day for all of its products surpassing the updated processor performance limit and those intended for data centers.



Nvidia did not specify the reason for the expedited timing as per US authorities' instructions, but it mentioned that it did not anticipate an immediate impact on its earnings due to this development.



In accordance with the latest export ban, Nvidia is required to cease deliveries of modified advanced AI chips, namely the A800 and H800, without a license. These chips were created for the Chinese market as substitutes for the A100 and H100 AI processors, which were subject to previous US restrictions in October 2022.



Two other prominent US chip manufacturers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel, which supply AI semiconductors to China, are also affected by this recent embargo.

It hasn't been easy betting on tech-market underdogs in 2023. The winners keep on winning - while the also-rans just get run over.

Such was the case with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock on Monday, as it lost 3% even though the NASDAQ closed in the green for the day. It was a reminder that the market can treat the ultra-competitive tech-component market as a zero-sum game, wherein there cannot be winners unless there are also losers.

ShowNvidia seeks to dominate another hardware nicheGet ready for the downgradesIs it time to give up on Intel? Nvidia seeks to dominate another hardware niche

Apparently, it's not enough for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip industry. Now the company wants to muscle its way into Intel's niche: components for personal computers (PCs).

Actually, Nvidia isn't alone in this quest. According to Bloomberg, the company is teaming up with British semiconductor

manufacturer Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) to develop processors for PCs. Reuters also reported on this development, after which Intel stock declined while Nvidia stock and Arm stock moved higher.

Apparently, the Nvidia-Arm processors could be available for sale as early as 2025. Furthermore, these processors will run on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system.

These Nvidia processors would use Arm 's technology. Reportedly, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), another Intel rival, is also developing PC processors with Arm's technology. Like the Nvidia-Arm processors, the AMD-Arm processors could also be available by 2025.

In addition, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has released Arm-based chips for its Mac computers. Thus, it appears that everybody likes Arm right now while hardly anybody favors Intel.

Get ready for the downgrades

If you've been immersed in tech stocks for a long time, you probably know what happens next. Analysts will come out of the woodwork to downgrade Intel stock and lower their price targets on the shares.

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out .

Meanwhile, they'll lift their already lofty price targets on Nvidia. However, analysts will be hard-pressed to raise their ratings on Nvidia stock since they can't go any higher than Strong Buy and Overweight.

On the other hand, they do have room to cut their ratings on Intel. Out of 31 Wall Street analysts, 20 of them had a Hold or equivalent rating on Intel stock as of Oct. 23. Thus, they could always pile on Intel and lower their ratings on the shares to Sell or something equivalent.

Then there's the earnings event that's coming up on Thursday . That's when Intel will report its financial results for the third quarter. Without a doubt, both investors and analysts will already be in a bad mood regarding Intel.

You may recall that in the first quarter, commentators constantly talked about AMD taking Intel's market share. Next, they'll be talking about Nvidia taking market share from Intel. Again, it's a bad year to root for tech underdogs.

Is it time to give up on Intel?

If a stock is obviously going to fall, just remember that investing isn't as easy as doing what's obvious. Otherwise, everybody would be a winner in the financial markets.

The markets are highly efficient. All known bad news that will affect a company's future revenue and earnings will immediately be priced into the stock. No one is waiting for the other shoe to drop; people and institutions just sell first and ask questions later.

This occurred in the first quarter, when everybody and their uncle already knew that AMD would eat Intel's lunch (i.e., steal Intel's market share). The market didn't wait for this problem to be reflected in Intel's upcoming earnings report; Intel stock immediately dropped to $24 and change.

Intel's impending demise could easily be described as'obvious,' but $24 and change turned out to be the bottom. Soon, the market - with its short attention span - stopped fretting about PC-market softness and who's eating whom's lunch.

AI chips became the greatest thing since sliced bread, and Intel adapted to the trend with its own AI-compatible processors. It turned out that the world didn't end for Intel and its cool-headed shareholders after all.

However, the world now feels like it's ending again. Analysts will extol Nvidia's dominance and lionize Arm while demonizing Intel yet again. The market's rotators will rotate because that's what they do.

However, with pessimism surging, there may be a prime setup for a positive earnings-event surprise with Intel. After all, new bull runs are born from extreme pessimism.

Thus, it's definitely not time to give up on Intel stock. In reality, it's when the critics are out in full force, as they are right now, that true contrarians should be in a buying mood.

With the help of this new AI, robots may be taught intricate feats like spinning pens in a manner akin to how people learn. Robots can learn through trial and error reinforcement thanks to Eureka's intelligent reward algorithms, which are created using generative AI and big language models like OpenAI's GPT-4.

This method has been shown to be almost 50% more effective than conventional human-authored programs, according to a paper written by Nvidia. According to a post on Nvidia's official blog, Eureka has been effective in teaching robots to perform a variety of activities, such as opening drawers, using scissors, catching balls, and more.

Anima Anandkumar, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA quoted:

Reinforcement learning has enabled impressive wins over the last decade, yet many challenges still exist, such as reward design, which remains a trial-and-error process.

According to the research, Eureka-generated incentive schemes outperform skilled human-written ones on more than 80% of tasks because they allow robots to learn through trial and error. The bots' performance improves by an average of more than 50% as a result.

Robots are rewarded for reinforcement learning by the AI agent, which uses the GPT-4 LLM and generative AI to create the necessary computer code. It doesn't require task-specific prompts or pre-defined incentive templates, and it readily accepts human feedback to change its rewards for outcomes that are more closely in line with a developer's goal.

The major innovation for Eureka was the fusion of language models' capacity for pattern detection with simulation technologies like Isaac Gym. Eureka successfully ""learns to learn"" by fine-tuning its own reward algorithms after a number of training cycles and even taking into account human input.

This research complements recent innovations from Nvidia Research, such as Voyager – an AI agent powered by GPT-4, capable of independently engaging in Minecraft gameplay.",infoq.com,3204,news,GB,en,Daniel Dominguez,https://res.infoq.com/news/2023/10/nvidia-eureka-ai-agent/en/headerimage/generatedHeaderImage-1698091268810.jpg,False,,7.9451537,3aa2c3c66836578bbad5bc322de5a778,0.0,0.0,0.9029104709625244,0.0,0.0,0.993730902671814

If, like me, you attached a Samsung 4K TV to your card but can't get the colours to look right on video playback. Then fear not, as I have experimented with many, many, many and dare I say many settings combinations. It took a while, but I finally found a sweet spot. Well, for my setup, anyway.

If you have a similar setup, here's what worked for me. I hope it helps.

First, prep your driver. For this, I recommend NVCleanstall; this tool allows you to create a driver package free from all the bloat that comes with the regular NVIDIA package.

Then, we need to perform a clean install. An excellent tool for this is DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller). This tool not only cleanly removes old drivers completely but, for me, has an additional setting to prevent Windows update auto-updating the driver. For me, the Windows update driver kept causing the NVIDIA control panel to crash when adjusting colour settings with game mode enabled. See the attached screenshot DDU_Uninstaller_Settings.png for this setting. Also, it is best to run in safe mode.

In Windows Display Settings, make sure Use HDR is Off for the TV.

Chinese cybersecurity company 360 Security Group has purchased about 1,000 artificial intelligence chips from Huawei Technologies Co, the latest proof that more Chinese companies are embracing homegrown AI chips amid the US government's chip export restrictions to China.


Zhou Hongyi, founder of 360 Security Group, told media including China Daily in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province that 360's purchase of Huawei's AI chips came even earlier than what Baidu did.


The move came after the US government tightened restrictions of Nvidia's high-end AI chips to China.


""When there were no AI chips to use, it was Huawei's products that provided timely assistance,"" Zhou said, adding that the company is now transferring its AI framework to the platform of Huawei's Ascend 910B AI chips.

Nvidia's RTX 4000 lineup is slated to get a few new entrants, namely the
 GeForce RTX 4070 Super
, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4080 Super. Leaks predict they'll consume 
more or less the same power
 as their non-Super counterparts and offer a marginal performance uplift. Those looking forward to getting their hands on one won't have to wait long if the information shared by renowned leaker 
Kopite7kimi 
is accurate. 


Nvidia plans to unveil the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Ti Super at CES 2024, which usually happens sometime in the first week of January. The information sits in line with an earlier prediction, which stated the GeForce RTX 4080 Super (then known as the 
GeForce RTX 4080 Ti
) would be unveiled in early 2024. 


Of the three, only the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super (thanks, Jensen) will get a VRAM bump from 12 GB to 16 GB. However, it will be powered by one of two GPUs, AD103-275 and AD102-175. Similarly, the GeForce RTX 4070 Super (12 GB GDDR6X VRAM) will be split between AD103-175 and AD104-350 GPU. Thankfully, the 
GeForce RTX 4080 Super
 will exclusively use an AD103-400 GPU. 


This leaves just the entry-level 
GeForce RTX 4050 desktop
 as the missing piece. Rumour has it that Nvidia will launch it in mid-2024 with 6 GB of VRAM. On the other end of the spectrum, the prospects of a 
GeForce RTX 4090 Ti
 seem dead.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The California-based chipmaker is expected on Thursday to launch at least three new artificial intelligence (AI), the H20 L20, and L2, and perhaps more, to replace the banned processors, media reported.

The performance density , or speed per die size, of the three chips is reduced to between 14.9% and 26.8% of that of the H100. Nvidia slowed their speeds with some hardware and software adjustments, according to technology experts.

The H100 is 6.68 times faster than the H20, technology analyst Dylan Petal says in an article published by SemiAnalysis on November 9. However, the H20 is 20% faster than the H100 in large language model (LLM) reasoning, he added.

LLMs are deep learning algorithms that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate content using very large datasets, according to Nvidia's website .

Nvidia Corp., the world's most valuable chipmaker, is updating its H100 artificial intelligence processor, adding more capabilities to a product that has fueled its dominance in the AI computing market.

The new model, called the H200, will get the ability to use high-bandwidth memory, or HBM3e, allowing it to better cope with the large data sets needed for developing and implementing AI, Nvidia said Monday.

Amazon Inc.'s AWS, Alphabet Inc.'s Google Cloud and Oracle Corp.'s Cloud Infrastructure have all committed to using the new chip starting next year.

The current version of the Nvidia processor - known as an AI accelerator - is already in famously high demand. It's a prized commodity among technology heavyweights like Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, who boast about their ability to get their hands on the chip. But the product is facing more competition: Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

is bringing its rival MI300 chip to market in the fourth quarter, and Intel Corp. claims that its Gaudi 2 model is faster than the H100.

With the new product, Nvidia is trying to keep up with the size of data sets used to create AI models and services, it said.

Adding the enhanced memory capability will make the H200 much faster at bombarding software with data - a process that trains AI to perform tasks such as recognizing images and speech.

""When you look at what's happening in the market, model sizes are rapidly expanding,' said Dion Harris, who oversees Nvidia's data center products. ""It's another example of us continuing to swiftly introduce the latest and greatest technology.'

Large computer makers and cloud service providers are expected to start using the H200 in the second quarter of 2024.

Nvidia got its start making graphics cards for gamers, but its powerful processors have now won a following among data center operators.

That division has gone from being a side business to the company's biggest moneymaker in less than five years.

Nvidia's graphics chips helped pioneer an approach called parallel computing, where a massive number of relatively simple calculations are handled at the same time.

That's allowed it win major orders from data center companies, at the expense of traditional processors supplied by Intel.

The growth helped turn Nvidia into the poster child for AI computing earlier this year - and sent its market valuation soaring. The Santa Clara, California-based company became the first chipmaker to be worth $1 trillion, eclipsing the likes of Intel.

Still, it's faced challenges this year, including a crackdown on the sale of AI accelerators to China. The Biden administration has sought to limit the flow of advanced technology to that country, hurting Nvidia's sales in the world's biggest market for chips.

The rules barred the H100 and other processors from China, but Nvidia has been developing new AI chips for the market, according to a report from local media last week.

Nvidia will give investors a clearer picture of the situation next week. It's slated to report earnings on Nov. 21.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/14/TP_d6872image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.462271,4fd27c5684de0467764899998132f546,0.0,0.9997256398200989,0.0,0.9648832082748413,0.0,0.0

4 Reviews

Nvidia has not yet confirmed the return of the Super variants for the current RTX 4000 series, although these will most likely be officially introduced in the announced CES address scheduled for early January next year. A new report from  - a Chinese site that keeps track of inventory and orders from several Nvidia, AMD and Intel board partners in the SEA zone - now adds more fuel to the rumored release of the Super GPUs from Team Green, which will instead cut back on production for non-Super models.

 informs that, in order to ensure sufficient initial supplies for the upcoming RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4080 Super cards, Nvidia is stopping production or at least enforcing an inventory cutoff for the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080 cards. Board partners are already placing orders for the Super variants, but this does not necessarily mean that the non-Super cards are completely discontinued.

As noted by Videocardz, the report seems to equate discontinuation to production stop, yet the terms are not actually synonyms when it comes to GPU supplies. Since the demand for such cards is still relatively high with the AI craze in full effect, Nvidia is probably only temporarily stopping production for the aforementioned non-Super cards in order to fill all the Super orders from board partners. Non-Super cards should still be produced in some capacity at least until the next gen RTX 5000 cards get introduced in late 2024.",notebookcheck.net,5474,tech,AT,en,Bogdan Solca,https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/RTX-4070-Ti-Super-Design-Template.jpg,False,,6.8133492,dd7c76eda940cca5a5aed56eed7b7c0b,0.0,0.7877534627914429,0.0,0.0,0.5458080172538757,0.0

If a handful of technology giants comprise the'Magnificent Seven,' then Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be considered the most magnificent of them all. Truly, the hot topic of the year has been artificial intelligence (AI), and Nvidia has been the poster child of the machine-learning hype.

It's an unusual pick, since Nvidia doesn't develop generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Yet, everyone and his uncle discovered the perfect picks-and-shovels investment at the same time, as Nvidia develops processors that can power gen-AI applications.

Thus, the chipmaker's massive success is'obvious' in hindsight, and seemingly everybody knows with 100% certainty that the company will have a blockbuster third-quarter 2023 earnings report. The problem is that when everyone in the market assumes one thing will happen, something else typically does.

Nvidia stock: A'compelling' valuation?

In the financial markets and elsewhere, it's normal and natural for people to want to be on the winning team. This helps explain why, after 10 consecutive days of gains and a 240% year-to-date rally in Nvidia stock, the prevailing sentiment is that the stock isn't over-stretched and will continue to rise.

Evidently, both retail traders and analysts are overwhelmingly bullish about Nvidia stock even though the U.S. government is enacting new restrictions on AI chip exports to China. Believe it or not, out of 38 prominent Wall Street analysts, 37 of them maintain a Buy or equivalent rating on NVDA, and the 38th analyst has a Hold rating on the stock.

I'm certainly not denying that Nvidia's products are the best in class. Indeed, the company's new AI-compatible chip, the H200 , should help it keep its rivals at bay. On the other hand, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani suggested that the H200 chip's launch isn't anticipated until mid-2024.

In any event, the H200's rollout won't have an impact on Nvidia's Q3 2023 results. Nonetheless, it feels like Wall Street is so forward-looking nowadays that it's pricing Nvidia's assumed future growth into the shares rather than looking back and reflecting on the company's third-quarter performance.

That's dangerous when Nvidia trades at 199 times its GAAP-measured trailing 12-month earnings. For reference, the sector median price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 24.9, so investors shouldn't generalize that all technology stocks are overpriced and Nvidia's valuation is typical.

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out .

Nevertheless, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Vivek Arya somehow considers Nvidia's valuation'compelling.' Evidently, bearish-leaning analysts are an extinct breed in late 2023. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Toshiya Hari is typical, assigning a Buy rating and a $605 price target to NVDA stock.

In assigning that share-price objective, Hari is modeling best-case scenarios that haven't actually happened yet. Specifically, the Goldman analyst anticipates'sustained revenue growth through CY2024' for Nvidia based on a'strong and broadening demand profile in the Data Center, plus an improving supply backdrop.'

Expecting a beat and raise

Oddly enough, it's gotten to the point where analysts are setting expectations and then assuming Nvidia will beat those expectations. This calls into question whether those expectations make any sense at all.

I'll refer to Arya, the aforementioned Bank of America analyst who thinks Nvidia's valuation is'compelling,' as an example. Evidently, Arya expects Nvidia to'beat/raise consensus when it reports on Nov. 21.'

Statements like this from influential big-bank analysts could create a setup for massive disappointment come earnings-reporting time. It won't be enough for Nvidia to hit a home run; only a grand slam will be good enough on Tuesday.

As the old saying goes, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. I found one prediction that Nvidia's Q3 2023 data-center revenue will have grown 226% year over year. If this is the standard nowadays, then we're living in strange times.

Here's another way to look at it. In 2022's third quarter, Nvidia earned 58 cents per share. Fast-forward to the third quarter of 2023, and Wall Street's experts predict that it will have earned $3.37 per share.

Has the NVDA share price gone too high, or have the market's earnings expectations gotten out of control? The answer may be,'All of the above.' Investors are behaving as if Nvidia were the only AI chipmaker in Silicon Valley, which of course isn't the case.

Another'Magnificent Seven' member, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), plans to introduce its own AI chips . With this industry being so lucrative lately, don't be too surprised if more tech firms jump into the fray with their own AI-compatible processors .

In other words, Nvidia has a heavy burden as the number-one darling of the financial markets in 2023. Whether Nvidia can retain that title in 2024 is questionable - and whether the company can possibly meet Wall Street's standards on Tuesday is a matter for prudent investors to consider.

The Silicon Valley chip titan said it made a profit of $9.2 billion on revenue that soared to $18.1 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.

""Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,"" Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in an earnings release.

""Nations and regional (cloud service companies) are investing in AI clouds to serve local demand, enterprise software companies are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms, and enterprises are creating custom AI to automate the world's largest industries.""

Revenue from sales of chips tailored for data centers set a record in the quarter, hitting $14.5 billion, according to Nvidia.

Nvidia continues to ramp up production to meet demand, chief financial officer Colette Kress said on an earnings call.

- China curbs -

Kress said new United States export control regulations aimed at China and other markets including Vietnam and parts of the Middle East are expected to cause sales of Nvidia data center chips to suffer in those markets.

""We expect that our sales... to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter,"" Kress said.

""These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products.""

Sales of chips now requiring export licenses to China and other affected markets have accounted for a fifth to a quarter of Nvidia's data center unit revenue over the past few quarters, according to the company.

Nvidia is confident strong growth in chip sales in other regions will ""more than offset"" what is lost in China, Kresse said.

The United States last month said it was ramping up curbs on exports of state-of-the-art AI chips to China.

The new rules tighten measures taken a year ago that banned the sale to China of microchips that are crucial to the manufacturing of powerful AI systems.

But calls to further close the supply chain grew after the world discovered the powers of AI with the launch of ChatGPT, a tool that debuted a year ago.

Also causing alarm in Washington was news that China-owned Huawei had released a new smartphone that featured a powerful home-grown advanced chip.

When announcing the beefed-up curbs, US officials insisted they were intended to close loopholes and prevent China's development of AI for military use.

Attention has been focused on Nvidia's industry leading H100 chip, which is crucial for the creation of generative AI, the technology behind ChatGPT and other powerful systems.

Following the announcement, China said it was ""strongly dissatisfied"" and ""firmly opposes"" the curbs.

The rules will not affect chips used in consumer goods such as laptops, smartphones and gaming consoles, though some will be subject to export licensing requirements, a statement said.

Nvidia saw revenue climb in each of its divisions, including chips for high-performance gaming computers.

""Gaming has doubled relative to pre Covid levels, even against the backdrop of lack of luster (personal computer) market performance,"" Kress said.

""We enter the holidays with the best ever lineup for gamers and creators.""",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/21/AFP_12695image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,9.237637,afd463aabd6dd912ac3dad8c0724a4c8,0.9999760389328003,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Analysts anticipate over 170 percent growth in revenue for this period.



The astonishing performance doesn't stop there; projections for Nvidia's fiscal fourth quarter, based on estimates from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), suggest an even more impressive figure: nearly 200 percent growth.



As Wall Street heads into the Thanksgiving holiday, attention is keenly focused on Nvidia, a key player in this year's surge in artificial intelligence. In 2023 alone, Nvidia's stock price has soared by 245 percent, surpassing all other members of the S&P 500. The company's market capitalization now stands at USD1.2 trillion, surpassing Meta and Tesla.



However, any signals during the earnings call indicating a slowdown in enthusiasm for generative AI, a shift of significant customers to AMD's processors, or adverse effects from restrictions in China could pose challenges for a stock that has experienced remarkable growth.



'Expectations are high leading into NVDA's FQ3′24 earnings call on Nov-21,' Bank of America analysts noted in a statement last week. They have given it a buy rating on the stock and stated that they 'expect a beat/raise.'



Nevertheless, they highlighted that investor focus will be drawn to concerns regarding restrictions in China and increasing competition. Specifically, the rise of AMD in the generative AI market introduces a new element for Nvidia, which has traditionally dominated the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market on its own.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_StockMarkets_47_menafn.jpg,False,@menafn,8.473401,dd3cec9ea73b608ab66fd2ea1104b285,0.9743580222129822,0.0,0.0,0.9999097585678101,0.0,0.0

According to a lawsuit filed against Nvidia, the company's senior staff member Mohammad Moniruzzaman made this error while giving an online presentation to a team from his former employer Valeo.

During the course of the presentation, Moniruzzaman accidentally displayed a file from Valeo, proving he stole its tech secrets, reports The Verge.

Valeo alleged that Moniruzzaman'downloaded without authorisation the entirety of Valeo's advanced parking and driving assistance systems source code' in early 2021, along with'scores of Valeo Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDF files, and Excel spreadsheets.

For three decades, Valeo has helped usher in a new era of automotive technology through innovation in advanced driving assistance systems.

'The actions of one brazen former employee and the company he left Valeo to join - Nvidia - have undermined, and threaten to further undermine the many years of Valeo's hard work and innovation,' read the lawsuit.

""By using Valeo's stolen trade secrets (the former employee has been criminally convicted and a penalty order has issued for his theft), Nvidia has saved millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars in development costs, and generated profits that it did not properly earn and to which it was not entitled,' the lawsuit alleged.

""So brazen was Moniruzzaman's theft that the file path on his screen still read ValeoDocs,' it added.

In this lawsuit, Valeo seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief and recovery of damages for Nvidia's trade secret misappropriation, including Moniruzzaman's brazen misconduct and the illegitimate advantage he has given Nvidia in its development of advanced parking and driving assistance software.

Nvidia did not immediately respond to the lawsuit.

In a letter sent to Valeo's attorneys, a law firm representing Nvidia claimed the company'has no interest in Valeo's code or its alleged trade secrets and has taken prompt concrete steps to protect your client's asserted rights'.

Letting the Nvidia card do the rendering with Frame Gen and passing the resulting output through AFMF on the AMD card that is connected to the display, the average fps in Cyberpunk can be boosted by 290%. However, in some games, the 1% lows show dramatic drops due to AFMF not working properly.

AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution
 is presented as an open source alternative to 
Nvidia's DLSS
, yet FSR has not yet managed to provide performance boosts and image quality on par with Team Green's solution, so there is no real incentive for developers to provide FSR support on GeForce cards. Even with FSR 3.0 introducing its own version of frame generation called 
AMD Fluid Motion Frames
, Team Red's performance still lags compared to 
DLSS Frame Gen
. Now, what if we could somehow combine DLSS FG and FSR AFMF? The South Korean team at  actually managed to combine the two technologies leading to impressive performance boosts in demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077, but, since this solution is not officially supported by AMD and Nvidia, and Team Red's drivers are still in beta, the results are not yet consistent across the board. 


Also, the hardware setup required to pull this 'unholy union' is essentially taking a page out of the SLI and Crossfire playbook, meaning that we actually need two GPUs.  used a mid-range 
AMD RX 6600
 in conjunction with 
Nvidia's RTX 4090
. Apparently, the setup does not really work with cards like the 
RX 6500 XT
 that integrate only 4 GB VRAM, as the AMD side needs at least 8 GB VRAM plus higher processing power to produce a stable, crash-free experience. Obviously, one would additionally need a motherboard with two X16 PCIe slots plus a PSU that can support the two GPUs. 


Other than that, the software setup is not too complicated. The AMD card will be the one connected to the primary monitor, while the Nvidia card will be selected to do the rendering workload. This only works in full screen mode, and the execution chain starts with the Nvidia card rendering the game with DLSS FG enabled, then the output is passed through the AMD card that interpolates the result with AFMF, leading to fps gains of almost 300%. 


Besides Cyberpunk 2077, the test suite included games such as 
CoD Modern Warfare III
, 
Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart
 and 
Starfield
. DLSS FG + AFMF clearly produced the most frames in all the games (if not by too much in some cases), but not the same can be said about the 1% lows. In CoD MW III, for instance, the 1% lows were lower than the AFMF or FG tested alone. The guys over at  note that the tests did not even use upscaling, so average fps can further be improved through DLSS and FSR upscalering methods. There is one particular graph that shows how AFMF is not yet effective for scenes with fast camera movement, causing dramatic drops in frames due to the driver dynamically disabling the feature. 


It would be interesting to see if the experiment can be taken further by adding the processing power from an Intel or 
AMD iGPU
 or even a third 
Intel GPU
, since Team Blue's 
XeSS
 is also said to be open source.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

'Every day, China wakes up trying to figure out how to do an end run around our export controls ... which means every minute of every day, we have to wake up tightening those controls and being more serious about enforcement with our allies,' Raimondo told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on December 2.

'If you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI, I'm going to control it the very next day,' she said in a warning to Nvidia, which had tried to ship A800 and H800 chips to China after the US banned the exports of the faster A100 and H100 chips in October 2022.



She said her department needs extra resources on top of the current US$200 million budget to strengthen the enforcement of the United States' chip export controls. She stressed that

China is'the biggest threat we've ever had' while'China is not our friend.'

Chinese state media criticized Raimondo for her comments.

Co-founding and helming Nvidia, currently ranked as the sixth-highest-rated company globally, Huang's leadership has positioned the company as a driving force behind the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia's chips and software play a pivotal role in powering AI applications, including the training of models like OpenAI's GPT chat.



An interesting facet of Nvidia's success lies in its financial prowess, with projections indicating that the company's revenues for the current fiscal year could surpass the combined revenues of all American video game manufacturers. This achievement takes on added significance considering Nvidia's humble beginnings as a supplier of computer hardware for video games and a manufacturer of graphics chips for personal computers and Microsoft's Xbox devices. Notably, the company dominated the gaming sector until just last year.



The transformation undergone by Nvidia is hailed as one of the most astute and intelligent shifts in the business landscape. This transformation echoes historical pivots like Nintendo's shift from playing cards to game consoles and Toyota's transition from textile looms to automobiles. Huang reflected on the transformative journey during the DealBook Summit organized by The New York Times, expressing his preference for navigating situations on the brink of destruction, indicating a resilience and enjoyment in the face of challenges.



Nvidia's strategic pivot from a gaming-centric focus to becoming a linchpin in the AI domain exemplifies the company's adaptability and foresight, positioning it at the forefront of technological innovation.

It will be replaced by the 6 GB version and come with a price cut.

A while ago, we reported that Nvidia planned to port the laptop version of the GeForce RTX 3050 over to desktops. However, the original GeForce RTX 3050 desktop with 8 GB VRAM will soon be a relic of the past. The folks over at the Board Channels forum (via Videocardz) say that Nvidia plans to replace the GeForce RTX 3050 8 GB version with the 6 GB variant.

Nvidia has asked OEMs to replace the existing GeForce RTX 3050 8 GB (US$229 on Amazon) assembly lines with the 6 GB version. The former will be sold until stocks last, after which the latter will be the only RTX 3050 variant on the market. A corresponding price reduction could put the graphics card in the highly competitive sub-US$200 segment.

The GeForce RTX 3050 6 GB features a GA107-325 GPU with 2,560 CUDA cores and can boost up to 1,470 MHz with a max TGP of 70-100 Watts. Its bus-width will presumably be restricted to 96-bit. Nevertheless, with no GeForce RTX 4050 in sight, it seems to be the closest thing Nvidia will launch to an affordable graphics card in 2024.",notebookcheck.net,5474,tech,AT,en,Anil Ganti,https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc4/RTX-3050-6-gb-cursed.jpg,False,,7.666657,32b12a1dd23fff2a0b1250259ee4f933,0.0,0.5376900434494019,0.0,0.0,0.7978277206420898,0.0

Reported discussions between authorities in the United States and Nvidia Corp on the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China prove that the nation is an important market for the growth of several US tech giants, and that politically motivated controls by the US will only cause huge losses to multinational companies, industry experts said on Tuesday.
 
The comments come after Reuters quoted US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo as saying that Nvidia ""can, will and should"" sell AI chips to China, but not the most sophisticated ones.
 
Just a week ago, Raimondo had warned chip manufacturers including Nvidia at a forum. She said that if any company tries to circumvent US export rules by redesigning a chip that would enable China to make strides in AI, she was going to ban the new chips ""the very next day"".
 
Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association in Beijing, said Raimondo's latest remarks reflect how vital the Chinese market is to the success of US tech giants.
 
""Though the US government wants to restrict the export of AI chips to China, it has to consider the interests of US companies,"" Xiang said.
 
Highlighting the large size of the Chinese chip market, he said that ""no business is willing to sacrifice benefits and incur financial losses for the sake of biased political reasons"".
 
""The fact is that politically motivated US controls also spurred Chinese tech and internet companies to stock more varieties of AI chips rather than the products of just one manufacturer, and many of the companies are also accelerating the development of their own chips to avoid potential risks in the future,"" he added.
 
When asked how the Commerce Department would respond to a recent chip-making breakthrough in China, Raimondo said the US will take the ""strongest possible"" action to protect its ""national security"".
 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a news conference on Tuesday that China is firmly opposed to the abuse of export control measures by the US, which has seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.
 
These measures are also not conducive to the stability of global chip production and supply chains, and violate the principles of market economy and fair competition, she said, emphasizing that they are not in the interests of any party.
 
US officials have repeatedly said the country has no intention of ""decoupling"" from China or obstructing China's economic development, she said, adding that the US should honor these commitments.
 
Last year, China's semiconductor purchases totaled $180 billion, accounting for around a third of the worldwide total of $555.9 billion, consolidating the country's status as the largest single market for semiconductors, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
 
For instance, the Chinese market currently accounts for around 20 percent of Nvidia's total sales.
 
Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said last week that the company is working closely with the US government to ensure that new chips for the Chinese market are compliant with the export curbs.
 
Though Nvidia is a dominant supplier of AI chips to the Chinese market, Huang said earlier this year that companies such as Huawei Technologies are among a slew of ""very formidable"" competitors to Nvidia in the race to produce the best AI chips.
 
Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital, said in an interview that the original goal of the US was to slow down China's AI capabilities but, in fact, related actions have boosted China's self-development capability.
 
Many Chinese cloud giants are working on building their AI ecosystems without US chips due to these restrictions, he said.
 
Tao Qing, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said in October that China will step up the development of AI chips as part of efforts to promote fundamental technological breakthroughs in AI and introduce applications of the cutting-edge technology in more sectors.
 
For instance, Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings has a self-developed AI chip, Zixiao, which is focused on processing images, videos and natural languages.
 
Huawei Technologies, on the other hand, is gaining momentum with its Ascend 910B.
 
Baidu Inc also said earlier this year that the US government's chip export controls will have limited impact on the company in the near term, as its chip reserves, as well as other alternatives, will be sufficient to support several AI-native apps for end users.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202312/12/65787e16a31040acaf827cd5.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,9.3920145,c7d4f0be3de6d55bc814b15521dbbcbe,0.0,0.0,0.9999902248382568,0.0,0.0,0.999904990196228

BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Chinese chip designers including Tencent Holdings are aggressively pitching their AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia's, hoping U.S. export restrictions will prompt clients to switch, said four people familiar with such discussions.
California-based Nvidia commands as much as 90% of China's $7 billion market for chips used to process enormous amounts of data to develop artificial intelligence (AI) software.
However, U.S. strategic technology controls that intensified in October have emboldened even smaller names such as state-backed Hygon Information Technology and startup Iluvatar CoreX to take the fight to the U.S. goliath.
Huawei Technologies is widely seen as making the most progress, with its Ascend 910B being compared to Nvidia's A100 in terms of computing power though not overall performance.
But Tencent and smaller AI players are accelerating chip product launches and organising more marketing visits, betting that while U.S. rules affect only the most advanced chips, they could still turn clients off Nvidia, the people said.
Tencent, China's largest social media and gaming firm, which also sells cloud services to external clients, has been pushing services that use the AI inference chip Zixiao it developed with deep learning startup Enflame, touting performance comparable to some Nvidia chips, two of the people said.
One of the people said Tencent is pitching its Zixiao v1 variant as a cheaper substitute for Nvidia's A10, used for image and speech recognition AI applications. It is also pushing an upcoming v2Pro variant optimised for AI training as capable of replacing Nvidia's now-blocked L40S, the person said.
Tencent uses Zixiao chips internally and does not sell them directly to external clients. It rents computing power to clients via its cloud services, which also offer Nvidia or AMD chips as options.
Tencent said it does not have plans to develop Zixiao beyond the current version.
""Tencent designed Zixiao to complement our cloud products and solutions in compliance with laws and regulations. It is only available to clients through Tencent Cloud's enterprise services,"" a company spokesperson said.
Others are pitching direct sales. Tencent-backed Enflame, which has an AI training accelerator chip called Yunsui, and Iluvatar CoreX, which makes the Tiangai graphics processing unit (GPU), have also been promoting upcoming upgrades of their offerings as substitutes for Nvidia's advanced A100 chip, two of the people said.
Hygon is marketing its newly released GPU, Shensuan No. 2, as designed from the outset to be compatible with Nvidia's chips computing platform CUDA, meaning Nvidia users can switch chips with minimal design changes, a third person said.
Last month, startup Intellifusion announced the Deepedge10 chip to compete with the upcoming H20 chip that Nvidia designed to be compliant with the latest export curbs.
A fourth person said Intellifusion brought forward its announcement to capitalise on Nvidia's situation, licensing the chip to clients even though it is yet to be mass produced.
Enflame, Iluvatar CoreX, Hygon Information and Intellifusion did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.
PRODUCTION CAPACITY
Technology firms in the world's second-largest economy have started to move towards Nvidia alternatives. Tencent itself has said U.S. curbs sent it looking for domestic sources of AI training chips. And internet search leader Baidu placed a hefty order for Huawei chips, sources said last month.
""Our competitors in China, that's a whole lot of startups ... There's like 50 startups that focus on AI. Huawei is a formidable competitor. Other U.S competitors, Intel, AMD are all very rigorous competitors. We have no shortage of competition,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters last week in Singapore.
Should Chinese chip designers win orders, they could still struggle for production capacity given constraints U.S. curbs put on foundries such as TSMC from working with Chinese firms, said Isaiah Research Vice President Lucy Chen.
""The majority of China's advanced manufacturing processes and advanced packaging capacity are likely to be prioritised for Huawei's use. These emerging companies need to strategise on how to overcome the constraints posed by U.S. restrictions and production limitations,"" she said.
Still, the curbs have created a market opportunity as tech giants pursue a strategy of having more types of AI chips in stock rather than just Nvidia's, with sustainability of their AI strategy becoming a priority rather than performance, said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital.
""The (United States') original goal was to slow down China's AI capabilities but, in fact, related action has boosted China's self-development capability,"" he said.
""Many Chinese cloud giants are working on building their AI ecosystems without U.S. chips due to these restrictions.""

319,Nvidia's DLAA makes PC games look better with little performance hit,Friedrich Stiemer,2023-12-21 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2139570/how-to-activate-dlaa-better-game-graphics-without-sacrificing-performance.html,pcworld.com,Nvidia's DLAA tech replaces traditional anti-aliasing technologies to offer better visuals with no performance hit.,"With DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing), Nvidia launched a technology intended to offer gamers an even more intense gaming experience. This sister feature to Nvidia's vaunted DLSS using the same underlying technology to improve the visuals in games that support it.

DLAA uses machine learning to effectively smooth images and eliminate unsightly 'staircase' effects, similar to traditional anti-aliasing technologies. The difference to the already familiar DLSS technique: DLAA does not rely on a change in resolution. While DLSS artificially enhances low-resolution images to increase performance, DLAA works with your game's original resolution and concentrates exclusively on the anti-aliasing task, or edge smoothing.

Now you are probably wondering how you can activate DLAA in your games and what requirements need to be met to do so. Only select games support it, like Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Diablo IV, Spider-Man, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. As a rule, you'll find the option to activate DLAA in the graphics settings of the respective game. The prerequisites are that the game actively supports DLAA and that you're using an Nvidia GeForce graphics card from the RTX 20-series or newer. Only RTX cards can tap into DLAA (and DLSS).

IDG

The advantages are obvious: DLAA offers very good anti-aliasing without losing visual information — alternatives like TAA tend to struggle during motion-filled scenes, where DLAA doesn't. Furthermore, DLAA's loss of performance is lower than with conventional anti-aliasing methods. The decision whether to use DLSS or DLAA should be used depends largely on the performance of the graphics card and the requirements of the game in question.

If you have enough power to run the game at the desired resolution and frame rate, DLAA offers you an excellent opportunity to improve the image quality. DLSS, on the other hand, is ideal for all situations in which it is difficult to achieve the desired resolution and frame rate. This is because renders the game at a lower internal resolution and then upscales it using AI to fit your screen. It looks damned good in practice, but there can be some graphical irregularities introduced, whereas DLAA simply offers you better-looking graphics at the same performance.

IDG

The choice between DLAA and DLSS is less a question of anti-aliasing and more a question of the desired balance between image quality and performance. Experiment for yourself and decide which method is best for you. For example, in situations with a lot of movement, there may be a clear difference between the two techniques, with DLAA often providing the sharper image. But this always depends on the game in question and your individual preferences.",pcworld.com,786,news,US,en,Friedrich Stiemer,https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/geforce-rtx.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,False,PCWorld,8.233293,a8ff52db565008ddcfa2929854c97eda,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9612681269645691

Intel, AMD, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and indeed ARM are competing to create GPUs for GenAI","In a frothy market, the shrewd opportunist will sell soap and wands to blow bubbles. Turkish flower exporters capitalised on the 17th-century Dutch tulipmania; Lehman Brothers and other banks created 'collateralised debt obligations' to fuel the housing boom in the mid-2000s, while simultaneously Cisco drove computer networking equipment to accelerate the internet bubble before the dotcom crash.
Then there was the first Californian millionaire Sam Brannan, whose Waterford-born father Thomas had emigrated to Portland Maine in 1775. Learning of the discovery of gold at Sutters Mill in 1848, Sam Brannan bought up as much prospecting equipment as he could find.
Then, opening the only specialist store for gold diggers, he reportedly catalysed the
 Californian gold rush
 by striding the San Francisco streets shouting 'gold, gold, gold from the American river!'
Nvidia's sales into the cryptocurrency sector weakened as that sector underwent a technology transition and a market collapse
Today, 
US chip maker Nvidia 
is successfully leveraging a market frenzy.
A mere 15 months ago, Nvidia appeared to be in deep trouble when it wrote off a large product inventory as the computer gaming market on PCs stalled after its boom during the Covid pandemic.
At the same time, Nvidia's sales into the cryptocurrency sector weakened as that sector underwent a technology transition and a market collapse. By October 2022, Nvidia's stock price had declined 40 per cent compared to the previous year.
Earlier that February, Nvidia had abandoned its attempt to acquire UK-based ARM, a semiconductor design company particularly dominant in the mobile phone sector. Nvidia had offered €36 billion in 2020, but the proposed transaction faced severe regulatory objections in the EU, UK, USA and China over both anti-trust and national security concerns.
today the stock price is over 300% since autumn just a year ago. Its core products underpin this year's explosive growth of investment in generative artificial intelligence
Nvidia had also expanded its headquarters in Santa Clara (California) in early 2022, with the futuristic 'Voyager' building named after a Star Trek starship.
A smaller and equally avant-garde building, 'Endeavor', opened in 2017 for a cool €340 million. In light of the autumn 2022 stock price decline, some investors were querying the prudence of such lavish real estate plays.
However today the stock price is over 300 per cent since autumn just a year ago. Its core products underpin this year's explosive growth of investment in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). A shortfall in the supply to the major cloud vendors, enterprise sector and start-ups focusing on GenAI has resulted in a market squeeze and premium pricing.
What does Nvidia make? Its core products are 'graphic processing units' (GPUs), which were originally specialised particularly for computer gaming. GPUs simultaneously process substantial volumes of data concurrently in multiple streams and are particularly efficient at creating gaming images, mining cryptocurrency and training GenAI models.
Last week there were reports that at a company all-hands staff meeting, some newer employees complained that some old timers had become complacent and work-shy.
Those fortunate enough to have been granted stock options just a few years ago are now sitting on substantial personal fortunes as the stock price has climbed and their options vest. Chief executive and co-founder Jensen Huang apparently responded that working at Nvidia is voluntary, and individual staff members should act as chief executives of their own time and commitment.
Mainland China has been a key market for Nvidia but the Biden administration's export restrictions to China are curtailing advanced semiconductor technologies for supercomputers
There are of course inevitable multiple headwinds for Nvidia. Intel, AMD, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and indeed ARM are competing to create GPUs for GenAI. GenAI technology is facing scaling limits as envisaged because there is insufficient data to train hyperscale models of a trillion parameters or more.
Mainland China has been a key market for Nvidia but the Biden administration's export restrictions to China are curtailing advanced semiconductor technologies for supercomputers. Nvidia has had to withdraw products which were intended to comply with the US's China policy.
Huang is expanding opportunities elsewhere. The Indian market may emerge to become as significant to Nvidia as China. Despite investor scepticism at the massive investments made by Facebook in the metaverse, Huang nevertheless sees the long-term opportunity for Nvidia in the 'omniverse'.
Nvidia is one major multinational which is not yet an IDA client and it has no presence in the Republic. However, there is nevertheless Irish heritage
This would combine Nvida's core strength of real-time image processing for gaming with GenAI capabilities, thus allowing consumers to instantly create, explore and play in their own shared-experience virtual worlds.
Nvidia is one major multinational which is not yet an IDA client and it has no presence in the Republic. However, there is nevertheless Irish heritage. Martin Murphy had emigrated from Wexford to Canada in 1820 and, subsequently, his family were in the first wagon train to successfully cross the Sierra Nevada into California.
His two sons, Dan and John, opened a general store during the California gold rush and competed with Sam Brannan. They built a thriving business, in part sourcing beef and supplies from a Santa Clara ranch owned by a third son, Martin jnr. That ranch grew to be substantial on the back of the gold rush and now the two gorgeous Nvidia headquarter buildings are built on his former land.",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,Chris Horn,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/djukzU4Y9fjc5eYbxmnrXRnwKnQ=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/7MXLSYY46TNSGZF5ACKNVH5PUU.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,9.299707,2d26103799cb964d5945d54575765592,0.9999997615814209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9999514818191528,0.0

326,MSI Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630 Aero ITX 4G OC Review,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,2023-12-29 00:00:00,date,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/msi-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1630-aero-itx-4g-oc,pcmag.com,"Poor performance and an outdated feature set leave little reason to buy Nvidia's budget-minded GeForce GTX 1630, even in today's era of inflated-price GPUs.","The graphics card market is a highly competitive space, and something has to be on the bottom. Today, among new cards, that something is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630. Though you'll always find older cards that are slower and hold rank even further down the roster, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630 stands out as the slowest graphics card to be released within the last few years—and looking beyond the poky performance, we were able to tally up few other redeeming qualities. We put MSI's $162.99-MSRP GeForce GTX 1630 Aero ITX 4G OC through its paces to find this out, but would easily recommend the AMD Radeon RX 6400 or the Intel Arc A380 instead for a compact, low-cost graphics card.

Design: The Last of the Turings (Hopefully)

The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630 was released in June 2022, well into the life of the RTX 30 series, and it is the newest member of the GTX 16 series to date. And it's likely the last, as like all other GTX 16-series graphics cards, the GTX 1630 uses a stripped-down version of the ""Turing"" architecture used inside of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 20 line of graphics cards. The Tensor cores and ray-tracing cores that were used to support AI acceleration and ray-traced lighting in games are absent, leaving a feature set that is more in line with the GeForce GTX 10 series that predated the RTX 20 series and launched back in 2014.

Though stripping this hardware out makes sense, in some ways, for a budget graphics card, that decision is becoming increasingly hard to support. AMD included support for both ray-tracing and AI acceleration in its AMD Radeon RX 6400 that sits at the bottom of its RX 6000 series. Intel also included both of these features on its budget-oriented Intel Arc A380, which leaves Nvidia as the only one not providing these features on a budget-oriented card.

Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1630 also comes up short in the core count department, with just 512 CUDA cores, 32 texture mapping units (TMUs), and 16 raster operation processors (ROPs). It also has a limited 64-bit memory interface. Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650 Super, for comparison, has at least twice as many of all of these, which naturally makes it considerably faster.

Typically we would expect to see a lower price on the GTX 1630 to support these cuts, but that oddly doesn't seem to be the case. MSI set the GeForce GTX 1630 Aero ITX 4G OC with an MSRP of $162.99. This doesn't bode well, as the GTX 1650 Super has an MSRP of $159 even with more than double the resources. The reason for this odd pricing is that the GTX 1630 was launched during the last major GPU shortage, and its price was set accordingly, but it doesn't hold up well now that prices have been dropping back to normal.

The card I used for testing, as noted, is MSI's Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630 Aero ITX 4G OC, which was installed onto the standard GPU test bed that I use for all GPU reviews. This model of the card uses a dual-slot thermal solution with a single fan. The rear I/O panel on the card has a single HDMI port, along with DisplayPort and legacy DVI outputs. The card does not require additional power and thus does not have a PCI Express power connector.

Test Setup

Our test system includes an Intel Core i9-12900K processor with an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard and 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM clocked at 5,600MHz. A Corsair Hydro Series H100X was utilized to keep the processor cool during the testing process. The system also has a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD and a Corsair HX1500i 1,500-watt 80 Plus platinum power supply for power. All tests were run on Windows 11 Pro with all of the latest Windows updates installed.

The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630 faces stiff competition at the bottom end of this market segment. The aforementioned Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super is one standout competitor, but so is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 that launched all the way back in 2016. The GTX 1630 may have architectural improvements over the GTX 1060, but it also has fewer than half as many cores and a significantly more constrained memory interface.

More recent competitors, like AMD's Radeon RX 6400 and Intel's Arc A380, are more evenly matched in many respects to the GTX 1630, but those cards both have features that the GTX 1630 lacks. Typically, we would test a few games with ray-tracing support, but the GTX 1630 can't run those games with ray-tracing enabled, so I was forced to omit them this time around. The Radeon RX 6400 and Arc A380 were able to run those titles, though, and while they struggled to run games like F1 22 with maxed settings, they are able to do a decent enough job when the settings are turned down.

Testing the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630: Synthetically Speedy

The GTX 1630 on paper looks quite lacking, but in synthetic tests it showed it does have some potential.

Performance results from the GTX 1630 lingered at the bottom of the charts, but it did manage to beat out the AMD Radeon RX 6400 in 3DMark and in the Unigine Superposition OpenGL test. The Intel Arc A380 maintained a healthy lead over both competitors, but still this gave me some hope that the GTX 1630 wouldn't be quite as slow as its specs suggested.

Realistically Not: AAA Games Tests

This illusion vaporized immediately as soon as I started testing the GTX 1630 with actual games. Not only did it fail to beat any card in the list in any test at any resolution, but its closest competitors at times performed close to twice as fast.

The GTX 1630's best result was getting just 8 frames per second (fps) in Total War: Three Kingdoms at 4K compared with the Arc A380's 9fps; a difference of 12.5%. That's not to imply that 4K is a high point for the GTX 1630, as the Arc A380 was 75% faster and 82% faster than the GTX 1630 in the 4K tests in Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry 5, respectively. (Not that anyone should be running anything at 4K with this grade of card, mind you, and expecting anything like playable frame rates.)

At less-demanding resolutions, like 1080p, the GTX 1630 was able to pull a bit closer to its competitors typically, but not by much. In Far Cry 5 at 1080p, the Arc A380 still maintained a 51% lead over the GTX 1630, with the AMD Radeon RX 6400 and, yes, the vintage Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 both even faster. The story is more or less the same in all of the modern games we tested.

Legacy Games: No Joy Here

Well, modern games clearly aren't the GTX 1630's comfort zone, so how about some older games? Makes sense that things might be better in that department, right? Well, no, not really.

In truth, the results we see in these older titles are all over the place, and this is partially due to drivers. Compared with the RX 6400, we see the GTX 1630 performing about the same as in the more modern games we tested. The GTX 1630 pulled a lot closer to the RX 6400 in Hitman Absolution than it did in any other games, but not by enough to tie with it, let alone beat it.

Intel's Arc A380 wasn't able to run the Bioshock Infinite or Sleeping Dogs benchmarks and performed abysmally in Hitman Absolution, but I'd hesitate to call this a win for Nvidia's GTX 1630, either. Rather I'd call it a loss for Intel. Furthermore, it's a loss that can be corrected with time and driver updates. You have no correcting for the GTX 1630's lack of rendering hardware, no matter how much time you give it.

Last, compared with the GTX 1060, the GTX 1630 was simply humiliated. The GTX 1060 was three times faster in Bioshock Infinite at 4K than the GTX 1630. It's to the point that the GTX 1060 almost ran the game at 4K as fast as the GTX 1630 did at 1080p. Results weren't quite that drastically different in the other games, but with a better-than-twofold lead on the GTX 1060's part, nothing about the GTX 1630 impressed here, either.

Power and Thermals

I test the power consumption of the graphics-card testbed as a whole with only the graphics card changed between tests to gain a rough idea of how much power each card consumes.

Having few hardware resources has one advantage: It helps to keep the power consumption low! And sure enough, the GTX 1630 is one of the least power-hungry cards we've ever tested. But that doesn't translate into a win, as the Intel Arc A380 and AMD Radeon RX 6400 both used considerably less power under load, to better effect.

The card's thermal solution performed well enough to keep the card from overheating, with the card reaching a peak temperature during testing of 52 degrees C.



No matter how you look at it, the GeForce GTX 1630 is simply not a graphics card that anyone should buy. Its $162.99 price doesn't make sense. It's within reach of other cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 6400 or the Intel Arc A380, that retail for $159 and $139, respectively. Both of those cards drive far better performance, and even with Intel's ongoing driver issues, we'd unquestionably recommend either of those cards over the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630. From a performance perspective, a price perspective, and a performance-per-dollar perspective, the GTX 1630 is simply inferior to these alternatives.

Furthermore, the GTX 1630 is also significantly slower than the old Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, as well as other older graphics cards. Those cards are selling for under $100 on the secondhand market and also are much better alternatives. And if you need something with low power consumption or a compact physical footprint, the GTX 1630 is again beat out by other options like the Radeon RX 6400.

Put simply, we see few qualities in the GTX 1630 that make it recommendable even in niche scenarios. If you see it on sale for a wildly low price (under $60, perhaps?) you might spring for it as a basic display adapter. However, a quick search on eBay shows that you can buy a GTX 1060 for $60, and we have no question that would be the better option, so it has to be lower than that. As that's unlikely to happen, it's best to just avoid the GTX 1630 entirely.",pcmag.com,492,news,US,en,Michael Justin Allen Sexton,https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/05V1DUT6IMY3jR2PsIb9svY-2.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1701719910.jpg,False,,8.531797,a584c3d95d0ec88371acab1488906e33,0.0,0.0,0.999969482421875,0.0,0.9999961853027344,0.0

The usage of software has increased in various automotive applications such as telematics, infotainment & communications systems, powertrain, body control & comfort, and ADAS & safety. These applications have resulted in increased lines of code over the last decade. For example, the software lines of code have become 15 times longer than in the last decade.

It is estimated to grow further at a high rate due to major developments in the applications of vehicles, especially in the autonomous vehicle space, in terms of over-the-air (OTA) updates, use of hypervisors, ADAS, and V2X, among others. Accordingly, automotive players are focusing on the safety, quality, reliability, and security of vehicle software. This will raise the demand for automotive software for efficient functioning, thereby boosting revenue growth during the forecast period.

The automotive software market comprises major manufacturers such as Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), NVIDIA Corporation (US), BlackBerry Limited (Canada), and Continental AG (Germany), etc.

The passenger cars segment is expected to have significant opportunities during the forecast period

The passenger cars segment is expected to dominate the automotive software market during the forecast period as software services have a higher penetration in passenger cars than commercial vehicles.

The major factor accelerating the demand for automotive software in passenger cars in developed countries is a strong demand for advanced applications such as ADAS and connected car services. The rise in demand for advanced applications for the automotive sector led the major players to adopt the strategy.

For example, in February 2022, Harman International (US) acquired Apostera (Germany) to focus on connected technologies for automotive, consumer, and enterprise markets. Apostera's augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) software solutions will expand HARMAN's automotive product offerings. All these factors are expected to boost the revenue growth for passenger cars segment in the automotive software market.

Battery management systems segment is likely have noticeable grow in the automotive software market during the forecast period

The battery management systems segment, by EV application, is expected to hold a significant market share in the automotive software market during the forecast period. Battery management systems play a critical role in enhancing the battery's performance and useful lifespan.

These systems monitor operational parameters such as the current, voltage, and internal temperature and reduce the stress on the battery by delivering adequate power to the electric vehicle's motor. The increase in sales of BEVs is likely to support the revenue growth of the battery management systems segment in the automotive software market.

For instance, in June 2023, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) announced that they will launch next-generation BEVs globally and full lineup to be launched by 2026. Such development of BEVs will increase the demand for battery management systems, and automotive software plays a critical role in it as it enables the system to perform its essential functions such as controlling the charging and discharging of the battery, and optimizing power, among others.

Europe shows noticeable growth potential for automotive software market

Europe is expected to register the noticeable growth in the automotive software market during the forecast period. Europe covers France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Spain, Russia, Turkey, and the Rest of Europe for market analysis. The region is home to the top Tier I suppliers in the automotive sector, such as Continental AG (Germany), Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany), and ZF Friedrichshafen AG (Germany).

The presence of these companies would contribute to the growth of European automotive software during the forecast period. The region is among the largest markets for passenger cars, particularly premium cars (C segment and above). The high volume of premium car sales can be attributed to the high purchasing power of European buyers.

The presence of automotive OEMs such as Volkswagen (Germany), Mercedes-Benz Group AG (Germany), Renault (France), Stellantis NV (Netherlands), and AB Volvo (Sweden) further offers lucrative opportunities for the automotive software market in the region.
