Recently, the Ethereum smart contracts have seen a surge in interest from the scientific community and new commercial uses. However, as online trade expands, other fraudulent practices—including phishing, bribery, and money laundering—emerge as significant challenges to trade security. This study is useful for reliably detecting fraudulent transactions; this work developed a deep learning model using a unique metaheuristic optimization strategy. The new optimization method to overcome the challenges, Optimized Genetic Algorithm-Cuckoo Search (GA-CS), is combined with deep learning. In this research, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in the phase of exploration in the Cuckoo Search (CS) technique to address a deficiency in CS. A comprehensive experiment was conducted to appraise the efficiency and performance of the suggested strategies compared with those of various popular techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), random forest (RF), and support vector classification (SVC), in terms of restricted features and we compared their performance and efficiency metrics to the suggested approach in detecting fraudulent behavior on Ethereum. The suggested technique and SVC models outperform the rest of the models, with the highest accuracy, while deep learning with the proposed optimization strategy outperforms the RF model, with slightly higher performance of 99.71% versus 98.33%.
 




 
Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform and famous cryptocurrency alternate platform, in addition to the most well-known platform for peer-to-peer programming. The security of blockchain technology and supervision has been recently receiving much attention. This open-source blockchain technology may be used to create smart contracts. Its development resolves the issue of Bitcoin's restricted scalability. Because of the versatility of the Solidity language, developers may create general-purpose smart contracts. Among the various smart contracts, some may be fraudulent, taking ether from network participants. Ethereum has risen rapidly because of its simplicity and versatility. Ethereum is currently the second most valuable cryptocurrency, only after Bitcoin. Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained in popularity as a result of their creation by Clohessy et al. [1], Li and Whinston [2], and Liu and Serlaetis [3]. The major purpose is to empower individuals by allowing employers to manage their own data and transactions. One such cryptocurrency is Ethereum, which was established by Vitalik Buterin. In brief, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency allocation system that allows a user to send fractional cryptocurrency to anybody at a low cost; because Ethereum is built on a blockchain network, everyone may use the digital transactions, with extremely minimal transaction fees, in a secure manner. The vast user base of Ethereum encourages developers to release their programs on the network, further solidifying Ethereum as the primary platform for decentralized programs such as DeFi and NFTs. A much more scalable infrastructure will soon be made available by the backwards-compatible Ethereum 2.0 protocol, allowing developers to create decentralized apps with higher transaction throughput. A smart contract is a part of an existing application that is stored at a particular contract location on the blockchain. Apps can invoke the functionalities of smart contracts, alter their states, and start transactions [4,5]. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compiles programming languages such as Solidity and Vyper into bytecode, which is then used to implement smart contracts on the blockchain technology. The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and various mining techniques has increased the demand to exchange the most diversified data; however, fraudulent activities have also appeared in online services. Unfortunately, the development of these data pertains to numerous distinct security sectors, so sharing them is difficult, especially when they contain information that requires privacy and security. The integration of automation in blockchain has resulted in the fast acceptance of the technology in several industries, such as online finance, the Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management, healthcare, insurance, and so on [6,7]. Blockchain is a global and immutable ledger that makes it easier to record transactions between both receiving and sending parties and monitor assets in a corporate network. Meanwhile, Ethereum is a P2P network for securely implementing and verifying application code, referred to as smart contract accounts. Smart contracts enable parties to transact with one another even without a trusted centralized government.There is a concern that criminal transactions may be concealed. However, owing to the nature of the blockchain, all transaction data are public, and anybody may obtain transaction information. Nevertheless, as wallets and transactions for cryptocurrencies grow in quantity and become more common, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The fact that the blockchain is decentralized indicates that no one entity has control over it. If a scam occurs, it would be difficult to identify the perpetrators. These concerns, along with the users' anonymity, may lead to fraudulent activity. The detection of suspicious transactions in such vast financial transaction networks has been the subject of several research works. The majority of these works have modeled fraudulent transaction patterns based on the timestamps and quantities of one or more transactions as features and used these models to detect unknown transactions. Much research has been undertaken to optimize models and evaluate fraud detection. The goal of this study is to enhance the suggested methodology for detecting fraudulent actions on the blockchain. Anomalies in the Ethereum blockchain's transactional data are investigated. Transactions that depart from the norm are considered abnormal or suspicious. Furthermore, whether these transactions are lawful or criminal, they should be investigated. We ran a large experiment to compare several machine learning models using various performance metrics [8,9].A deep learning model has been developed to predict fraudulent transactions in real time. It can be used to improve the efficiency of the system by implementing a novel optimization technique. The proposed model with large datasets has been taken into account considering that it can keep up with the growth of the Ethereum network dataset and still predict accurately.To propose a model that can detect fraudulent activities on the blockchain of Ethereum.To propose a deep learning approach with a limited number of features for Ethereum fraud detection.An evaluation of the proposed model's performance against different models is performed. It takes into account the various performance measures used by different classifiers.To implement the model independently of the user interface.According to the literature study, the majority of earlier work for identifying fraudulent transactions used machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques such as random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and so on. However, there has been relatively little work done using the deep learning technique, which has the ability to provide results very fast and precisely. Furthermore, when compared to random forest and other prominent approaches, deep learning outperforms numerous high-performing algorithms when addressing problems in several disciplines. In order to overcome overfitting, the suggested work uses a deep learning technique based on novel GA-CS optimization. This strategy can accurately identify anomalous transactions. Using the suggested algorithms as the primary algorithms for our research, we will conduct a thorough comparison with other generally used algorithms such as random forest, regression, and so on. Additionally, we tweak the suggested model using hyperparameter tuning to improve its performance. With great efficiency and minimal memory utilization, the proposed model will anticipate Ethereum transaction fraud. Figure 1 displays the workflow of the process followed in this study.The remainder of the paper is coordinated as follows. Section 2 contains the literature summary for this study. Section 3 considers categorization modeling and the underlying principles of the proposed method. Section 4 describes the data preparation, experimental setup, and efficiency metrics for several methods. Section 5 presents the experimental data. Section 6 closes with a recap of previous work and numerous ideas for future review.One of the most well-known types of Ethereum fraud is the Ponzi scheme. Jung et al. [10] developed a data mining methodology to identify Ponzi fraud, a system in which only early investors gain from the money collected from later investors and, after a period of time, the plan collapses, leaving later investors with nothing. They constructed their dataset by using open-source Ethereum smart contracts, which included previously identified Ponzi smart contracts, and discovered that their pyramid scheme fraud detection model based on data mining has precision of 0.99 and recall of 0.99 and can protect against these deceitful contracts.These misleading pyramid schemes were thoroughly investigated by Bartoletti et al. [11], who also evaluated their nature and effects from a variety of angles. By retrieving their Solidity codes and then confirming them with the blockchain EVM codes, they created a dataset of these fraud schemes. The most likely scams, according to a thorough investigation of these schemes, are those that promise large profits, explain their dependability with the justification of open access to the source code, and have a Gini coefficient of more than 80%.Chen et al. [12] presented a categorization model not relying on the source code to automatically identify fraudulent schemes using smart contracts with labels and extracting essential features without source code. They constructed their dataset by manually checking from etherscan after collecting open-source smart contracts. They concluded that their proposed model can identify fraudulent schemes at the time of their creation, and their suggested method (RF) increases the precision to 0.95 and outperforms other methods such as XGBoost and one-class SVM.Vasek et al. [13] studied the extensive network of fraudulent pyramid schemes that entice Bitcoin users and looked at the availability and demand of these schemes. By collecting information on victims' dialogues with scammers, they also examined the demand side and supply side of these scams. They collected data by researching the full history of scam allegations, gambling, and games involving investments, as well as information from the locations wherein these fraudulent incidents were marketed. They came to the conclusion that if the scammer maintains contact with the victim, the scam lifetime increases, and if the victim maintains more frequent daily updates, the fraud lifetime falls.Ajay et al. [14] suggested using secure smart contracts built on the ERC20 interface on a blockchain network with the necessary functions and procedures, to provide a comprehensive framework for safeguarding manufacturing activities based on the Cloud. It is very difficult to uncover features that allow the precise identification of anomalous contracts, and statistical analysis based on these attributes is equally unsuccessful. Second, they disregard the instabilities and internal consistency of smart contract accounts, which largely contributes to model obversion. Ali Aljofey et al. [15] employed a web crawler to collect data and obtained unique bytecodes for contracts confirmed by etherscan.io, which they then translated into opcodes using the pyevmasm disassembler. A feature vector was built by combining transaction characteristics, opcode n-grams, and document frequency. To construct a powerful classifier, the ensemble learning model was used as a feature vector together with the extra trees and gradient boosting machine learning techniques. This entire model was then utilized to categorize anomalous contracts. In contrast to other algorithms, such as DT, XGB, LGBM, and GBM, the results revealed accuracy of 89.67%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model. Combining characteristics significantly improves detection. IoT devices are more often secured through firmware updates. Traditional updating systems have drawbacks, including bandwidth constraints and attacks by hackers' distributed denial of service (DDoS).Runnan Tan et al. [16] presented a model that utilizes web crawlers to collect tagged bogus addresses, after which a transaction network is rebuilt using the public transaction book. Then, to extract node attributes for detecting fraudulent transactions, an amount-based network embedding approach is developed. Ultimately, a graph convolutional network is used to differentiate between legal and counterfeit addresses. Results show accuracy of 95%, which indicates the system's high effectiveness in identifying fraudulent Ethereum transactions.Qi Yuan et al. [17] proposed a model to discriminate between phishing and non-phishing nodes, and an SVM approach was used. The detection objective was 1259 phishing nodes, and 1259 unlabeled nodes at random as outliers were chosen. To build a subnetwork, the aforementioned nodes' first-order neighbors and transaction records were crawled. After obtaining a massive Ethereum transaction network, nodes were depicted using a network embedding approach. Word-embedding-inspired random-walk-based network embedding approaches, which try to maintain the local structural properties, have been used, and node2vec, an outstanding random-walk-based method, was employed to represent nodes. At this stage, the SVM classifier is used. Results showed that non-embedding approaches are ineffective in detecting phishing. Non-embedding methods are methods for manually extracting characteristics that, unlike embedding methods, cannot use structural information. Therefore, to obtain transaction network characteristics, the network embedding technique is crucial. It has been stated that Ethereum scams generate large profits and represent a severe threat to the Ethereum network's financial security.R. F. Ibrahim et al. [18] investigated unlawful accounts on the Ethereum blockchain and proposed a fraud detection model with three different algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). A dataset was used from Kaggle, with 42 features; later, it was reduced to only six features with the help of correlation coefficients, which selected only the important features. Results demonstrate a considerable improvement in time measurements when utilizing the three algorithms, as well as an improvement in",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Aziz,Das,Goel,Kartik Goel,Kumar,Mahto,Rabia Musheer,Rabia Musheer Aziz,Rajul Mahto,Saxena",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/applsci/applsci-13-00697/article_deploy/html/images/applsci-13-00697-g001-550.jpg?1672824356,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,8.629362,9ba29e78b67ce33a977002ea913d1701

4,Ether Capital Corporation Commits an Additional $13.4 Million to Ethereum Staking,,2023-01-11 00:00:00,date,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230111005542/en/Ether-Capital-Corporation-Commits-an-Additional-13.4-Million-to-Ethereum-Staking,businesswire.com,"Ether Capital is proud to announce it has allocated an additional 7,488 Ether (C$13.4 million equivalent) to Ethereum Staking.","January 11, 2023 07:38 AM Eastern Standard Time TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ether Capital Corporation ('Ether Capital' or 'the Company') (NEO: ETHC) is proud to announce it has allocated an additional 7,488 Ether (C$13.4 million equivalent) to Ethereum Staking, bringing the Company's total Staking balance to 28,000 ETH (C$50.2 million equivalent) representing 62 per cent of its total Ether portfolio.



Since Ether Capital's inception in 2018, the Company has held conviction that Ethereum will one day reshape the global economy and act as a primary settlement layer for financial activity. Staking Ether has always been part of the Company's core strategy to generate yield and support Ethereum as it continues to be the leading Layer-1 protocol. Ether Capital intends to use a portion of the revenue accrued from Staking (i.e. Staking Rewards) to build critical infrastructure that helps investors navigate the Ethereum ecosystem.

Ether Capital is one of the largest institutional holders of Ether and the first public entity in the world to stake a significant quantity of the token to generate yield. The Company believes Staking an additional 7,488 ETH will maximize shareholder value and position Ether Capital as a dominant player in industry. Security is also paramount, which is why the Company relies on a self-custody solution to safeguard both its Staked and non-Staked Ether in cold storage using a multi-signature wallet. This ensures no other parties are granted access to Company assets.

'Staking has always been a fundamental part of our roadmap and following last year's successful transition to a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, we continue to put our weight behind Ethereum as the number one platform of choice. By staking this additional Ether off our balance sheet, we help maintain the integrity of the network and further decentralize the ecosystem by moving validators away from a small number of service providers and centralized exchanges,' said Brian Mosoff, CEO of Ether Capital.

'Despite the pullback in asset prices over the past 12 months, we believe Ether Capital is in a healthy position to allocate more of our core ETH to Staking in order to generate an attractive yield and accumulate a greater amount of ETH,' said Ian McPherson, President and CFO of Ether Capital. 'In 2022, that yield was approximately 5.1 per cent of Staked Ether, generating revenue that supports the growth of our Company.'

Ether Capital looks forward to seeing how Ethereum's upgrades and scalability efforts play out in the months ahead and will update the market if it decides to Stake more of its Ether balance.

The issuing and verification of higher education certificates, including all higher education documents, still functions in a costly and inappropriately bureaucratic manner. Blockchain technology provides a more secure and consistent way to revolutionize the widely used generalized mechanisms and system concepts. In this paper, the most necessary requirements are examined regarding a blockchain-based higher education system, based on the most well-known research papers. Moreover, the opportunities of working on an education system by maintaining a decentralized structure organization are recommended as well. This paper recommends the most suitable blockchain scaling solution for the architecture of an education system which uses the most state-of-the-art EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) compatible approach to implement the higher education system with all the predefined requirements. It is proven that the explained smart contract-based higher education system, which uses zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine), consists of all necessary functionalities and satisfies all predefined requirements. In fact, the recommended system, by using a modular blockchain structure, implements all the functionality and capability of the examined related works in one system, namely GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which is compatible and more secure.

CoinShares is committed to providing investors with innovative, cost-effective, and reliable ways to gain exposure to Ethereum as it transitions from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. The 0% p.a. management fee offering on the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP reflects this commitment to trust, transparency, and fairness towards investors. Reducing the management fees to 0% positions CoinShares to capitalise on the upcoming Shanghai Hard Fork, officially planned by the Ethereum Foundation for March 2023. This update will enable ETH stakers to unlock their staked ETH and finally receive the staking rewards they have accumulated. The Shanghai Hard Fork will bring liquidity to Ethereum as the cryptocurrency units currently staking on the Beacon chain will be released for trading. As a result, CoinShares will be able to provide both liquidity and staking rewards to its investors in the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP. Reducing the management fees to 0% is a strategic move that allows CoinShares' investors to anticipate this significant moment for the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike most of its competitors, CoinShares already shares the revenue from the staking rewards of its staked ETPs (Polygon, Tezos, Polkadot, Cosmos, etc.) with its investors and charges no management fees. This new offering provides investors with a unique opportunity to gain exposure to Ethereum without incurring additional fees, and helps them prepare to benefit from the unlock of staking rewards in 2023. ""At CoinShares, we are dedicated to offering our investors access to transparent, fair, and reliable investment opportunities in digital assets,"" said Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO of CoinShares. ""The 0% management fee offering on the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP is a reflection of our commitment to accessibility and transparency, key factors in achieving mass adoption of digital assets. We are pleased to provide our investors with the opportunity to gain exposure to Ethereum without incurring additional fees in anticipation of the significant Shanghai update on the Ethereum blockchain.""

Over the past decade, there has been significant evolution in the security field, specifically in the authentication and authorization part. The standard authentication protocol nowadays is OAuth 2.0-based authentication. This method relies on a third-party authentication service provider with complete control over the users' data, which it can filter or modify at will. Blockchain and decentralization have generated much interest in recent years, and the decentralized web is considered the next significant improvement in the world wide web (also known as Web 3.0). Web3 authentication, also known as decentralized authentication, allows for the secure and decentralized authentication of users on the web. The use cases for this technology include online marketplaces, social media platforms, and other online communities that require user authentication. The advantages of Web3 authentication include increased security and privacy for users and the ability for users to have more control over their data. The proposed system implementation uses Ethereum as the blockchain and a modern web stack to enhance user interaction and usability. The solution brings benefits both to the private and the public sector, proving that it has the capability of becoming the preferred authentication mechanism for any decentralized web application.

To properly understand what Web3 authentication means, we will start the following article by diving into traditional login methods used in Web2, where the application/website interaction with the user consists of either validating user credentials or validating a third-party key generated by an external system or application.
Over the decades, we have seen an evolution of web-based applications from the initial stages at 1.0, where websites would serve static content with which the users could interact statically (the 1900s–2000s). Web 2.0 brought an advantage to the field, allowing users to interact with their content and dynamically change their surfing experience of an application or website (the 2000s–2020s). Service providers and application owners would centralize the user data and provide logistic support and allow for increased user interactivity. Web3 (the 2020s–present) promises to bring the playing field to a new level with decentralized service providers and an anonymous identity for all users.
User identities, consumer habits, navigation history, and patterns in behavior are generally stored and can be used to predict behaviors or to suggest possible areas of interest in fulfilling the user's desires.
With more and more websites collecting user and behavioral data without the users' consent or knowledge, a problem emerged such that users were no longer in control of their data and information. Instead, the European Union created a regulation specifically for this purpose in 2014 called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
This paper will explore a novel way of authenticating with a focus on decentralization by using the tools and concepts already used in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, bridging the gap between on-chain and off-chain resources. The first section will discuss current secure authentication methods, Web 3.0 definitions, history, and practical applications. The second section goes through our proposed technical stack for obtaining the desired authentication method. Afterward, we explain the advantages and disadvantages of Web 2.0 authentication versus Web 3.0.
Finally, we present a practical implementation of the proposed solution along with a step-by-step guide as well as the benefits and challenges of using an anonymous login system with no data that can be traced back to the user. A study was carried out to compare login times of the proposed implementation against similar login mechanisms.
Since the proposed login mechanism is one-factor, we observe the times required to perform a successful login using other one-factor relevant systems such as SMS login and also compare time differences between mobile phone wallet solutions and browser wallet software wallet solutions.
The most popular authentication mechanism relies on the user entering a username/email and password combination in order to gain access to the system. However, if the password becomes compromised, the user might lose access to the system forever. To enhance authentication security and increase account recoverability, many platforms resort to two-factor authentication (2FA) which is a security measure that aims to provide an additional layer of protection for online accounts and services. The concept of 2FA involves implementing a multi-factor authentication process, which requires the user to provide two distinct forms of identification. This approach is intended to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to an account, as it makes it more difficult for an attacker to bypass the authentication process. There are several different types of 2FA mechanisms, of which we can mention the following:
SMS-based 2FA: This type of 2FA involves sending a one-time code via text to a users' phone number. The user then enters this code to access their account. This method is simple to use but can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks, where an attacker can hijack the users' phone number and intercept the code.
A 4-digit code is generated on the server and stored along with the generation date. The code is then sent to the users phone via SMS, and upon entering it into the desired platform, successful authentication is achieved.
Time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs): This type of 2FA uses a software application, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, to generate a new code every 30 s. The user enters this code to access their account. This method is more secure than SMS-based 2FA because the code is generated on the users' devices and is not transmitted over a network.
The users need to have a pre-installed application used to generate codes that follow a pattern. The pattern is synchronized with the server pattern by scanning a QR code generated by the backend server. After logging in with the predefined credentials (username and password), a prompt needs to be filled in with the code generated on the application.
Biometric-based 2FA: This type of 2FA uses the users' unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to verify their identity.
Security Key: This type of 2FA uses a physical device, such as a USB key, that the user must plug into their computer or insert into their phone to access their account.
Using two-factor authentication (2FA) among websites and online services is increasingly relevant in cyber security. The frequency of 2FA implementation can vary depending on various factors, including the nature of the information being accessed and the industry in which the website or service operates. For example, a study conducted by Google in 2017 found that 2FA adoption rates had increased over time, with an adoption rate of 15% among all Google accounts.
Additionally, a study by Duo Security in 2019 revealed that while a majority (70%) of the top 100 most-visited websites in the United States offered 2FA, only a tiny percentage (3%) of users had enabled it on their accounts. This highlights the need for further education and awareness surrounding the importance and benefits of 2FA in protecting personal and sensitive information.
There is a trend in dropping the username and password combination and just using a single-factor authentication method to decrease the time required to create an account on a specific platform. Instead of entering the registration information (i.e., email and password) when using the application for the first time, the users are prompted to enter their phone number. Validation of the phone number is achieved by entering the SMS code received. As previously stated, to achieve a faster onboarding and login time, multiple applications or websites have started using authentication based only on the SMS code, without needing a username or password. However, recovering the account details might prove difficult if no email is associated with the account.
Our study aims to explore the feasibility of authentication systems based on complete anonymity, thus bridging the gap between operations performed on and off the blockchain.
Web3, also known as Web 3.0, is an idea of the next World Wide Web version, which focuses on decentralizing the data and a token-based economy [
1
]. Decentralization empowers peer-to-peer information exchange, eliminating intermediaries and removing third-party entities that might control the data. In public blockchains, cryptocurrencies play a significant role in the general scheme, as the token economy facilitates the centralization model. Information is stored in a distributed ledger outside the authority of a single point of failure or entity. Smart contracts allow for immutable code, allowing transparency and traceability.
Since Web 3.0 [
2
] proposes a decentralized architecture that is open to everyone, its connection with blockchain is obvious. Public blockchains operate independently, and data are never controlled by one single entity. Leveraging the power of blockchain, we can enhance Web 2.0 toward reaching full decentralized information and Web 3.0.
Web 3.0 architecture is slightly different than traditional architectures. It has a high focus on decentralization and is comprised of the following layers:
Application layer: Users interact with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the blockchain. dApps can be used for various purposes, such as online marketplaces and social media platforms.
Presentation layer: Tools and libraries used to interact with the blockchain.
Blockchain interaction layer: Application interfaces (APIs) and graphical interfaces used for debugging the blockchain's current state.
Network layer: Ensures communication between nodes.
As also mentioned by [
3
] in 
Figure 1
, we can see the multiple layers that compose blockchain-based decentralized applications. Our focus will be on the first layer, connecting the front-end layer to the back-end, leveraging the signature from the user-installed software or hardware wallet.
Decentralized finance, in short DeFi, aims to revolutionize the way financial systems work, removing intermediaries and empowering individuals and peer-to-peer transactions at reduced costs in a matter of seconds.
DeFi heavily relies on tokens [
4
] and smart contracts empowered by blockchain as opposed to traditional finance systems. Access to finances in a DeFi environment is primarily anonymous and can be done in a matter of seconds without a central authority to validate users' identities.
Some centralized finance concepts have also been implemented in the DeFi environment. However, since the users' identity is unknown, concepts such as collateral and interest have been adjusted to ensure that the systems work with zero knowledge of user-related information.
Lending and borrowing tokens require token liquidity [
5
], whereas, in real life, a physical asset would be required.
Decentralized exchanges (DeX) have paved the way for an innovative way of trading tokens. In centralized exchanges, authorities would facilitate trading between peers, and market makers would stimulate trading whenever a buy order was not present to fulfill the order [
6
]. On the other hand, matching buy-sell orders in a decentralized environment is relatively tricky, so the entire system relies on liquidity pools. If trading X token for Y token, there should be enough Y tokens available in the liquidity pool to fulfill the order. The balance between the two pools would eventually determine the buying price.
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are smart contracts that take the form of digital assets that leave a fingerprint on the blockchain.
Fungibility is the ability of goods and assets to be interchangeable. For example 1 dollar = 1 dollar. Non-fungibility means that all assets are unique, similar to paintings.
Non-fungible assets have multiple applications [
7
] and even though there has been a highly speculative bubble for digital art, their use can allow the asset holder access to certain events or resources. Each owner's identity is stored in the blockchain and can be verified via smart contracts.
There have been multiple marketplaces that have emerged that would allow the exchange of such assets.
Some practical uses of NFTs are the following:
Intellectual property and patents.
The concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) [
8
] is relatively simple. A democratic structure is formed, and voters would be all users holding crypto tokens.
There is no hierarchy, leadership, or boards, and since blockchain allows transparency and immutability, this concept provides increased trust.
DAOs heavily rely on smart contracts to ensure transparency and anonymity as opposed to traditional structures, such as company boards of executives. As a result, the decision power is spread to the community.
Ethereum wallets are applications that allow interaction with Ethereum [
4
] accounts. For example, an Ethereum account has access to the private key used to perform operations on behalf of the public key, which is the public address to which funds and assets can be transferred.
Wallets can be either software or hardware. For example, hardware wallets use an external device, such as a USB drive, to store users' private keys, whereas software wallets store the keys inside the computer/phone memory.
Most software wallets are built as browser add-ons, which makes it easier for decentralized apps to interact with them. However, some software wallets are in the form of phone applications. For example, the interaction with wallets in the form of phone applications can be tedious and may require external services to facilitate communication. The most popular third-party providers for mobile phone wallet connectivity are WalletConnect and WalletLink.
An example of interaction with mobile phone wallets can be seen in 
Figure 2
. The GUI (graphical user interface) displays a QR code which, upon scanning, triggers a connection request. After the connection is successful, it is stored on a third-party server which facilitates communication between the dApp and the wallet, similar to browser extension wallets.
WalletConnect relies on websockets to relay messages from and to the mobile phone wallet and the decentralized application. When the QR code from 
Figure 2
 is scanned on the mobile device, a connection is established and stored on the relay server (external server).

 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin offers aid for earthquake victims in Turkey 
By Nidhi Bhardwaj
: At least two significant donations from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have been made to aid those harmed by last week's deadly earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. 
In the early morning of 6 February, an earthquake of 7.8 magnitude was recorded due to which the deathtoll surpassed the 33,000 figure mark, and thus motivated crypto industry to offer help. 
How much has the Ethereum founder donated? 
On 11 February, the vitalik.eth address sent around $150,000 worth of ETH to Ahbap, a non-governmental and non-profit organisation dedicated to relief efforts in Turkey.
On 12 February, Buterin made his most recent donation of 50 ETH, or roughly $77,000 to Anka relief. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the donations were directed to Anka Relief, a Web3 relief support group that also organised the Ukraine DAO project. The latest donation adds to another 99 ETH that Vitalik sent in support of earthquake victims.
While highlighting the current support by Buterin, Anka praised the efforts of the Ethereum co-founder for his generosity and said 'Since day one of the disaster, we have witnessed donations piling in the wallets of a handful of major NGOs. Great that they have attracted and will be attracting more funds.' 
In the wake of continuous help from the crypto industry, a report from Etherscan, a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, suggests that the Ahbap wallet contains 409 ETH worth $622,000. It further claimed to have received $4.3 million in crypto donations, with stablecoins topping the chart. 
Crypto industry offering help
The Financial Times of London reported late last week that donations in cryptocurrency have been flooding in from all across the world. Companies had sent more than $10 million in cryptocurrency, with Binance alone offering $5 million to help the nation. 
Prior to this, cryptocurrencies have also been used for earthquake relief donations and to help with war efforts in Ukraine. The devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015 marked the maximum support in the form of donations in Bitcoin to relief organisations.

LONDON (PRWEB)
 
February 15, 2023
 
 
Voltz
 Protocol, DeFi's first synthetic interest rate swap (IRS) AMM, launches a 
GLP
 yield rate market on 
GMX
, providing traders an opportunity to speculate on the yield GLP will generate, which are paid in ETH, without needing to own or stake GLP. GLP is the liquidity token of the GMX exchange, a decentralized perpetual exchange built on 
Arbitrum
. 
 
Simon Jones, CEO & Co-Founder of 
Voltz
 Labs, said, ""GLP is the first Voltz Protocol market being launched on Arbitrum, so this is exciting for the community for a number of reasons. The GLP market itself is extremely volatile week on week. Launching this market on Voltz Protocol provides traders the opportunity to speculate on GLP returns without ever owning GLP. And since the returns are paid in ETH it also opens the door to interesting ETH-based structured products for traders too.'
 
The trading on GMX is facilitated by a multi-asset pool called GLP. It consists of 50-55% stablecoins, 25% ETH, 20% BTC, and 5-10% other altcoins, such as Chainlink and Uniswap.
 
The liquidity is added when users mint GMX Liquidity Provider Tokens (GLP). In exchange for minting GLP, they earn 70% of all fees generated on that particular blockchain. Contrary to some liquidity pools, GLP suffers no impermanent loss.
 
Anyone can become a supplier of this liquidity pool and, in return, earn fees. Users who want to trade perpetual swaps or spot on GMX can do it using the assets provided, and now they can trade GLP yield specifically on Voltz Protocol. Moreover, the GLP pool is a counterparty to the traders; as GLP token holders provide the liquidity used for leverage trading, they profit when traders lose — and vice versa. 
 
Because GLP price is a proxy to traders' directional views on many different assets, it presents the opportunity for traders to leverage the Voltz Interest Rate Swap protocol in order to hedge or speculate on future rates.

 /PRNewswire/ -- The EY organization contributed to the public domain the functional beta version of zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP) compiler Starlight to enable secure, private business logic on the public 
Ethereum
 ecosystem. Starlight supports the needs of complex business agreements where business logic must be shared between parties at the network level but privacy from competitors also remains critical.

Paul Brody
, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:
""Starlight's beta release is the next step in industrializing blockchain privacy technology. The goal is to help transform how enterprises do business by making B2B integration simple and standardized. With Starlight, developers can migrate complex, B2B business agreements from private portals and point-to-point systems like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), on to the public 
Ethereum
 network all while retaining the privacy and security that enterprises require.""
EY teams first contributed Starlight to the public domain in 2021 as a prototype business logic complier to facilitate the creation of zkApps, or decentralized applications that use ZKP technology. This is not the first time EY teams have contributed to the advancement of ZKP technology. In 2019, 
EY teams contributed the blockchain privacy-based protocol Nightfall
. Then earlier this year, 
EY teams updated the public domain source code of Nightfall
 to help enable the development of privacy-focused enterprise blockchain solutions. Nightfall and Starlight were both developed to address concerns around data sovereignty and privacy as enterprises learned how difficult it is to preserve commercial confidentiality on a shared network.

Starlight is also designed to bridge the knowledge and development gap for zkApps by making it easier for developers to bring and use privacy features in the construction of decentralized applications.
Dr. 
Duncan Westland
, EY Global Head of Blockchain Research and Development, says:
""zkApps have a steep learning curve, can take weeks or more to build, and require extensive experience with ZKP technology. Using Starlight, developers can easily mark-up standard solidity contracts with the elements and logic that need to be made private and compile them into zero knowledge applications that can be deployed on-chain.""
Brody concludes:
""With the combination of Starlight and Nightfall, the goal is to make it possible for enterprises to handle both large scale asset, inventory and payment management and multi-party business logic all on the public 
Ethereum
 network. Enterprises are still in the early stages of maturing these systems, but the end-state goal is clear: any multi-party business agreement with both shared data and business rules should be manageable on the public 
Ethereum
 blockchain, and without the need for a centralized intermediary.""

In today's era, humanity has been overwhelmed by technological revolutions that have changed and will continue to change how business operations are performed, directly or indirectly. At the same time, the processes within the supply chain are quite complex, and as technology and processes evolve, they become more and more challenging. Traceability has become a critical issue in the food industry to ensure safety, quality, and compliance with regulations. The adoption of blockchain technology in the food supply chain has gained significant attention as a potential solution to improve traceability. This paper presents the development of a distributed application for table olives' traceability on the Ethereum network. The paper also presents a methodological framework, which can help anyone aiming to implement an Ethereum decentralized application and demonstrates the practical use of the developed application by a Greek table olives producer. The application significantly improved the producer's product traceability by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for tracking and tracing the products in the supply chain. The app reduced the time, increased the accuracy and reliability of data, improved supply chain efficiency, and helped the producer comply with international regulations and standards.


 










 


Food traceability is the ability to track the movement of foods through the supply chain, from their origin, the stage of primary production, to their destination, the stage of consumption. Traceability is vital in the food supply chain, as it helps ensure food safety, quality, and compliance with regulations. Traceability is crucial in ensuring the food supply chain's security [
1
]. If a food product is contaminated, traceability can help identify the source of the contamination and allow for targeted recall or removal of the contaminated products from the supply chain. This can help prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses and reduce the risk of public health crises. Traceability can also help ensure the quality and authenticity of food products. By tracking the movement of a product through the supply chain, it is possible to identify any potential issues that may affect the quality of the product, such as mishandling, storage, or transportation. This can help ensure that food products are of the highest quality when they reach the consumer [
2
].
Additionally, traceability is often a legal requirement for food products, with many countries having regulations in place that require food companies to be able to trace their products through the supply chain. Compliance with these regulations is essential for businesses to operate legally and avoid fines or legal issues. It can also help build trust between consumers and food companies. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the safety and quality of the food they consume, and being transparent about the supply chain can help build consumer confidence in a brand. Finally, traceability can help improve the efficiency of the supply chain [
3
]. By identifying potential issues in the supply chain, such as delays or bottlenecks, companies can make changes to improve the flow of products through the supply chain, reducing waste and optimizing delivery times. Overall, traceability is crucial for the food supply chain and can help ensure food safety, quality control, compliance, consumer trust, and supply chain efficiency. Without traceability, the food supply chain would be vulnerable to contamination, fraud, and inefficiency, which could have significant public health and economic consequences [
4
].
However, the current system of tracing food products is often inefficient, fragmented, and prone to errors. There is no universally accepted system for food traceability, which can make it difficult for companies to implement traceability across their supply chains. Companies may use different technologies and methods for tracking their products, making it challenging to share data and collaborate effectively. The food supply chain is often complex and involves multiple stakeholders, from farmers and producers to distributors and retailers. This complexity can make it challenging to trace a product's origin and track its movement through the supply chain. Traceability requires collecting, managing, and sharing large amounts of data. Ensuring these data are accurate, complete, and up-to-date can be challenging, particularly when working with multiple stakeholders [
5
].
Blockchain technology, one of the most recent technological innovations for business processes, has the potential to offer a promising solution for improving the transparency and traceability of the food supply chain [
6
]. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions securely, imminently, and transparently, providing a tamper-proof and auditable record of events. Blockchain technology can provide a transparent view of the entire food supply chain, enabling all stakeholders to track the movement of food products from the farm to the consumer. This increased transparency can help build consumer trust and confidence in the food supply chain. Blockchain technology can help streamline the food supply chain by eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing paperwork and bureaucracy. This can help reduce costs and improve the efficiency of the supply chain [
7
,
8
]. Blockchain technology can also provide a secure and tamper-proof record of all transactions, making it easier to trace the origin of food products and track their movement through the supply chain. This can help reduce the risk of food fraud, contamination, and counterfeiting. Moreover, by enabling faster and more accurate tracing of food products, blockchain technology can help improve food safety [
9
,
10
]. In the event of a food safety issue, blockchain can help identify the source of the problem quickly, enabling prompt action to be taken to minimize the impact on public health. Finally, blockchain technology can enable greater accountability in the food supply chain by providing a transparent and immutable record of all transactions. This can help ensure that all stakeholders in the supply chain are held accountable for their actions [
11
,
12
].
There is a growing interest in the potential of blockchain technology for improving traceability in the food supply chain. However, despite this interest, there is still a gap in research on the specific applications of blockchain for the traceability of specific commodities such as table olives [
13
]. While some pilot projects and initiatives are exploring the use of blockchain in the food industry, there is a lack of systematic research on the challenges, opportunities, and implications of implementing blockchain-based solutions for table olive traceability. This research gap presents an opportunity for further investigation and exploration of blockchain technology for the table olive industry. Several factors may contribute to this research gap. One factor is the relative novelty of blockchain technology, which is still a developing area with many unknowns and uncertainties [
14
]. Additionally, there may be limited resources and funding available for research on blockchain applications for table olive traceability, particularly in comparison to other research areas. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of blockchain for the table olive industry are significant, and further research is needed to explore the feasibility, scalability, and impact of blockchain-based solutions for table olive traceability [
15
].
In this context, this paper presents an application of blockchain technology and, more specifically, the development of an Ethereum-based distributed application (dApp) that can help streamline and automate the traceability of the table olives supply chain, providing a secure and transparent way of recording transactions and ensuring that all stakeholders are held accountable for their actions. This research is the first of its kind for the table olives supply chain and manages to connect research with practice. The developed application is easy to use and offers a cost-effective traceability solution that is tested in real life at a Greek table olives producer. More specifically, the second section presents current research on blockchain applications for the food industry. The third section analyzes the table olives supply chain by also exploring the challenges and the potential benefits of blockchain traceability applications. The fourth section presents the materials and methods used for creating the Ethereum-based traceability distributed application. The fifth section demonstrates the case study of the research, i.e., the practical use of the table olives traceability application at a Greek table olives producer. Finally, the sixth section elaborates on the results of the practical application and explores the benefits gained.
Applications of blockchain technology for traceability in the food industry have significantly expanded during the last five years and reflect blockchain's potential to improve transparency and trust in the food supply chain. Numerous research papers have been published in recent years exploring the use of blockchain technology for food traceability [
16
]. These papers generally recognize the potential of blockchain to enhance food safety and supply chain management, promote transparency and trust, and reduce the risk of fraud and foodborne illness. However, the research on blockchain applications in the food industry is still in its early stages, and several challenges and limitations need to be addressed. Some of the key challenges include the need for collaboration and standardization, the complexity of the technology, and the regulatory and legal barriers to implementation [
8
,
12
].
Despite these challenges, several ongoing initiatives and projects are exploring the use of blockchain in the food industry. These projects include pilot programs that use blockchain to track food products from farm to table, as well as research initiatives that aim to address the technical, economic, and regulatory issues associated with blockchain adoption. In their systematic review, Feng et al. (2020) explored the current state of research on blockchain technology in the agri-food sector. They identified the potential benefits of blockchain, such as enhancing food traceability, improving supply chain management, and promoting transparency and trust. However, they also highlighted the challenges associated with blockchain adoption, including technical issues, regulatory barriers, and the need for collaboration and standardization. The study concluded by identifying research gaps and proposing areas for future research, such as exploring the impact of blockchain on food safety and sustainability [
12
]. Vu et al. (2021) conducted a systematic literature review for blockchain adoption in food supply chains to investigate the perceptions, attitudes, barriers, and applications of blockchain technology. The study found that there is a high level of interest in blockchain but also a need for more outstanding education and awareness about its potential applications. The authors also identified the need for collaboration and standardization in order to achieve widespread adoption of blockchain in the food industry [
17
].
In a similar vein, Krithika (2022) conducted a survey on the use of blockchain in agriculture, including case studies from various countries and crops. The study found that there is a high level of interest in blockchain, particularly in relation to food traceability and supply chain management. However, the authors also identified several barriers to adoption, including the lack of technical expertise and the high costs associated with blockchain implementation [
18
]. Lin et al. (2019) proposed a blockchain-based traceability system for food safety that utilizes smart contracts and a decentralized network to record and track the movement of food products. The authors described the architecture of the system and the process of creating and verifying transactions. They also discussed the system's benefits, such as improving transparency and trust in the food supply chain, as well as the implementation challenges, such as the need for standardization and interoperability [
19
]. Jaya et al. (2021) proposed a blockchain-based system for fishery products' traceability that utilizes the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to track the movement of seafood products from ocean to table. The authors performed several tests and achieved very efficient results in terms of performance and effectiveness. The authors also described the system's benefits, such as improving food safety and reducing fraud [
20
].
Moreover, Naveen et al. (2022) proposed a blockchain-based traceability system for tea powder based on Hyperledger Fabric. The authors described the architecture of the system and the process of creating and verifying transactions. They also discussed the system's benefits, such as improving transparency and trust in the tea supply chain. Duan et al. (2020) conducted a content-analysis-based review of the literature on the application of blockchain in the food supply chain. The authors identified the potential benefits of blockchain, such as enhancing traceability, improving supply chain management, and reducing food fraud. They also highlighted five possible obstacles, including a limited comprehension of blockchain, technological complexities, the manipulation of raw data, challenges in engaging all stakeholders, and inadequate regulatory frameworks [
21
]. Niya et al. (2020) proposed a blockchain-based system for Swiss dairy traceability through a decentralized dairy product Supply Chain Tracing (SCT) system. This system was created in collaboration with dairy producers and is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional and centralized SCT approaches. They also discussed the system's benefits, including social aspects and risks [
22
]. Rünzel et al. (2021) designed a sustainable blockchain-based honey supply chain. The authors presented the development and implementation of an open and image-based honey traceability system on a global scale, including various technologies such as data-driven honey yield prediction and verification, a blockchain-based smart distribution system, and pollen signature verification through machine learning algorithms, along with a final customer information portal. When integrated, these technologies can address several United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals [
23
].
Similarly, Yang et al. (2021) proposed a blockchain-based traceability system for vegetables and fruits that utilizes blockchain technology to distribute all required traceability information throughout the supply chain safely. Additionally, a smart contract based on reputation was developed to motivate network nodes to upload traceability data. Moreover, the authors conducted a performance analysis and practical application, with results indicating that their system enhances query efficiency, secures private information, ensures the authenticity and reliability of data in the supply chain management, and meets the necessary application requirements [
24
]. Rejeb (2018) proposed a traceability system for halal meat supply chains based on the integration of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) method, blockchain technology, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The system involves collecting data from IoT devices at different stages of the supply chain, which are then stored on a blockchain-based platform for secure and immutable record keeping. The paper also discusses the implementation of the system and evaluates its effectiveness in improving supply chain traceability and quality control [
25
]. Adamashvili et al. (2021) proposed a wine supply chain based on blockchain technology that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology to address issues such as product provenance, anticounterfeiting, and traceability in the wine industry. The authors presented a model that integrates blockchain technology to simulate the operations of the supply chain. The results showed that blockchain technology enhances transparency, improves the efficiency of the wine supply chain, and creates a better wine consumption experience for customers. The authors argued that the proposed model can potentially benefit stakeholders across the wine supply chain, including wine producers, distributors, and consumers, by improving supply chain management, reducing fraud and counterfeit products, and providing a reliable and trustworthy method for wine traceability [
26
].
Several pilot programs have also been initiated to explore the use of blockchain in the food industry. Walmart, JD.com, IBM, and Tsinghua University National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies formed in 2017 a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance aimed at improving pork meat tracking, traceability, and safety in China. The companies will work together to establish a standards-based method of collecting data on pork origin, safety, and authenticity using blockchain technology to provide real-time traceability throughout the supply chain. The collaboration will provide accountability and greater transparency into how food is handled, from the farm to the consumer, and will work with food supply chain providers and regulators to develop the necessary standards, solutions, and partnerships to enable a broad-based pork safety ecosystem in China. The insights gained from this initiative will help improve processes such as recalls and verifications and enhance consumer confidence worldwide [
27
]. Nestlé partnered with OpenSC, a blockchain platform that enables consumers to track their food to its origin, in 2019, aiming to achieve new levels of supply chain transparency. In its quest for total transparency, Nestlé is the first major food and beverage company to pilot open blockchain technology. The pilot program will initially trace milk from farms in New Zealand to Nestlé factories and warehouses in the Middle East, followed by testing the technology using palm oil sourced from the Americas. These trials will help Nestlé determine the system's scalability [
28
]. In collaboration with software provider SAP, Coke One North America (CONA), the  Technology (IT) company in charge of Coca-Cola's North American manufacturing supply chain processes, launched a pilot project in 2019 based on blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. The project was tested with two bottlers, Coca-Cola United and C.C. Clark, and is intended to be implemented across 70 manufacturers who collectively transport more than 160,000 bottles of Coke each day [
29
].
More recently, in 2022, Unilever and SAP collaborated on a pilot project that uses blockchain technology to increase transparency and accountability in the palm oil supply chain. The project aims to support sustainable and deforestation-free palm oil production by providing real-time visibility of the supply chain and tracing the origin of palm oil from the plantation to the refinery. The project involves tracking and verifying the sustainability practices of palm oil smallholders and suppliers, allowing Unilever to make more informed sourcing decisions and reduce the risk of purchasing palm oil linked to deforestation [
30
]. Carrefour started using blockchain with its own branded 'Carrefour Bio' organic products in 2022 to satisfy consumers' increasing demand for transparency in producing and sourcing organic products. This makes Carrefour the first retailer to use blockchain technology for their own-brand organic products. The technology will ensure secure data storage and provide transparent access to information about the production and shipping of Carrefour Bio products, from production to store shelves [
31
]. Finally, in 2023, VeChain, a blockchain supply chain management platform, joined forces with the China Animal Health and Food Safety Alliance (CAFA). This partnership aims to improve food safety and quality control while providing transparent information to consumers by providing a food traceability certification system for CAFA members, enabling them to track the entire life cycle of food products, from production to distribution and sale. The certification will be granted to products that meet CAFA's quality standards, helping consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. The collaboration is anticipated to boost consumer confidence in Chinese food products and strengthen CAFA's position in the industry [
32
].
Overall, the current state of research on the applications of blockchain technology for traceability in the food industry is characterized by a growing interest in the potential of blockchain to improve transparency and trust in the food supply chain. While several challenges and limitations are associated with blockchain adoption, ongoing initiatives and research address these issues and explore blockchain's full potential in the food industry. Future research could focus on addressing the technical, economic, and regulatory issues associated with implementing blockchain technology in food supply chains and the potential for blockchain to enhance food safety, supply chain efficiency, and consumer trust.
The olive industry is a significant component of the food supply chain, and the traceability of olives is essential to ensure food safety and quality, as the contamination of olives with pesticides, fungi, and bacteria can pose serious health risks to consumers. According to the International Olive Council, the global production of table olives in 2022 was approximately 2.85 million metric tons. The top producers of table olives in 2022 were Spain, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, and Greece [
33
].
The table olives supply chain consists of several stages that involve different actors and processes, ranging from the cultivation and harvesting of olives to the final packaging and distribution of the products to consumers. Each stage involves multiple actors, such as farmers, traders, processors, distributors, and retailers, making the traceability of olives challenging. The current system of tracing olives typically relies on paper-based records, which can be lost, damaged, or falsified, leading to inaccuracies and delays in tracing products. Each stage of the supply chain presents specific challenges and opportunities for traceability and quality control, which can be addressed through the use of blockchain technology [
34
]. However, several challenges are associated with implementing blockchain traceability systems in the table olives supply chains. These challenges can include technical, economic, and social factors that can affect the adoption and effectiveness of the technology. One of the main technical challenges is the interoperability of blockchain platforms and data standards. Several blockchain platforms are available, each with its own technical architecture and features. In order to enable seamless data exchange and integration across different platforms, a common set of data standards and protocols is required. This can be challenging to achieve in the table olives supply chain, where different actors and organizations may use different software systems and data formats [
35
].
Another technical challenge is the scalability and performance of blockchain systems. Blockchain technology relies on a distributed network of nodes to validate transactions and maintain the ledger. As the number of transactions and users increases, the system may become slower and less efficient, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. This can be a concern in the table olives supply chain, where large volumes of data and complex supply chain interactions may require high-speed and low-cost processing. An economic challenge is the cost of implementing and maintaining blockchain systems. While blockchain technology has the potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency in the supply chain, it also requires significant investment in infrastructure, software development, and training. This can be a barrier to adoption for small and medium-sized enterprises in the table olives supply chain, who may lack the resources and expertise to implement and operate blockchain systems [
8
].
A social challenge is the need for trust and collaboration among supply chain actors. Blockchain technology can enable greater transparency and accountability in the supply chain, but it also requires a high level of trust and cooperation among the actors involved. This can be a challenge in the table olives supply chain, where there may be issues of power imbalance, information asymmetry, and lack of communication among producers, processors, distributors, and retailers. Building trust and promoting collaboration among these actors is essential for successfully implementing blockchain traceability systems in the table olives supply chain [
36
].
Despite these challenges, implementing blockchain technology in table olives supply chains can offer several benefits. By providing a secure and transparent record of the product journey, blockchain technology can improve the efficiency and sustainability of the table olives supply chain while enhancing consumer trust and confidence in the products. Moreover, blockchain provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions, enabling stakeholders to trace the movement of table olives from farm to fork. Additionally, blockchain enhances the trust and transparency of the food supply chain by creating a decentralized network of actors who can verify the authenticity and quality of table olives. Finally, blockchain can facilitate information sharing among stakeholders, enabling real-time monitoring and control of the supply chain [
37
].
More specifically, the benefits can be identified by analyzing the major table olives supply chain stages, as shown in 
Figure 1
. Each stage presents specific challenges and opportunities for traceability and quality control, which can be addressed through the use of blockchain technology. The first stage of the table olives supply chain is the cultivation and harvesting of olives. This stage involves a range of activities, such as selecting the appropriate olive cultivar, planting and maintaining the trees, and harvesting the olives when they reach maturity. These activities are typically carried out by smallholder farmers or large agricultural enterprises, depending on the production scale. Traceability in this stage can be challenging, as the origin and quality of the olives may be difficult to verify, especially in cases where olives are sourced from multiple suppliers [
38
].
The second stage of the table olives supply chain is the processing and packaging of olives. Once the olives are harvested, they are typically processed to remove the bitter taste and improve their flavor. This may involve various techniques, such as soaking the olives in water or brine, fermenting them, or flavoring them with herbs and spices. After processing, the olives are packed in containers such as jars or cans, which are labeled with product information such as the origin, date of production, and ingredients. Traceability at this stage can be improved through the use of blockchain technology, which can provide an immutable record of the origin and processing of the olives.
The third stage of the table olives supply chain is the distribution and sales of the table olives. This stage involves transporting the products from the packaging facilities to the retail stores, where they are sold to consumers. The distribution stage can be challenging for traceability, as the products may pass through multiple intermediaries, such as wholesalers and distributors, before reaching the final consumer. However, blockchain technology can enable real-time tracking of the products throughout the distribution chain, providing greater transparency and reducing the risk of fraud or counterfeiting [
39
].
In summary, implementing blockchain traceability systems in the table olives supply chain involves several technical, economic, and social challenges. Overcoming these challenges requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach that addresses the specific needs and priorities of the different actors involved. By addressing these challenges, blockchain technology can enable greater transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in the table olives supply chain while enhancing consumer trust and confidence in the products. The present research aims to overcome the aforementioned challenges and make use of the opportunit",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Evripidis P.,Evripidis P.

Blockchain is a recently developed advanced technology. It has been assisted by a lot of interest in a decentralized and distributed public ledger system integrated as a peer-to-peer network. A tamper-proof digital framework is created for sharing and storing data, where the linked block structure is utilized to verify and store the data. A trusted consensus method has been adopted to synchronize the changes in the original data. However, it is challenging for Ethereum to maintain security at all blockchain levels. As such, 'public–private key cryptography' can be utilized to provide privacy over Ethereum networks. Several privacy issues make it difficult to use blockchain approaches over various applications. Another issue is that the existing blockchain systems operate poorly over large-scale data. Owing to these issues, a novel blockchain framework in the Ethereum network with soft computing is proposed. The major intent of the proposed technology is to preserve the data for transmission purposes. This new model is enhanced with the help of a new hybrid algorithm: Adaptive Border Collie Rain Optimization Algorithm (ABC-ROA). This hybrid algorithm generates the optimal key for data restoration and sanitization. Optimal key generation is followed by deriving the multi objective constraints. Here, some of the noteworthy objectives, such as information preservation (IP) rate, degree of modification (DM), false rule (FR) generation, and hiding failure (HF) rate are considered. Finally, the proposed method is successfully implemented, and its results are validated through various measures. The recommended module ensures a higher security level for data sharing.


 










 


Developers can create many distributed apps based on smart contracts over the Ethereum programming platform. For example, voting, financial transactions, business administration, and contract signing are the applications used in the Ethereum platform [
1
]. During data sharing, the protection of privacy is very important. If shared data fall into the wrong hands, the data could be misused and accessed by intruders, the denial of loans and health insurance, and victimization of a person by financial fraud [
2
]. However, if the data can be shared with the right users, then there is no information to be stolen and misused by unauthorized entities [
3
]. The newly developed privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) and privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) approaches are utilized to reduce privacy issues [
4
]. Data analysis contains commodity data, and mining turns it into economic value [
5
]. The digital world increases the possibility of losing control over all of one's own intellectual, emotional, and situational knowledge, breaking the informational privacy area and losing one's autonomy [
6
]. The primary problem in this situation is that control of privacy leakage by every individual requires high freedom in the flow of information the technology enables, the connections it facilitates, and the advantage supplied by the information source [
7
]. Government organizations also create legislative guidelines to protect personal data, including what purposes the particular data is used for, how it is gathered, and how it should be preserved. Corporate privacy issues are also solved by these guidelines [
8
].
Ethereum is a programming environment that makes it possible to provide privacy preservation with the help of blockchain by building over distributed applications [
9
]. With 'smartcontract', the contract may be carried out without needing a centralized authority after it has been installed. The smart contract executes intent in a perfect world, and it produces reliable results [
10
]. Blockchain is a new technology that has gained popularity due to the rise of cryptocurrency such as Ethereum and Bitcoin [
11
]. It may be considered a distributed ledger with cryptography, and accurately records the results of every transaction. A transaction recorded on the blockchain cannot be changed beyond that point, and everyone can see it [
12
]. Every network member will reach a consensus on the blockchain, ensuring that all valid transactions are recorded [
13
]. Secondly, every network member will reach a consensus on the blockchain, ensuring that no invalid transactions are recorded. Thirdly, all transactions recorded on the blockchain are auditable by network members and cannot be tampered with by other issues. Smart contracts are being deployed alongside the advancement of blockchain technology such as Ethereum and Hyperledger to increase the potentiality of blockchain [
14
]. Addressing a transaction for a certain smart contract's address will cause it to be activated [
15
]. When a smart contract is activated, it can run the predefined program independently through a centralized authority.
The challenges of the existing supply chain are shown below. Rival actors can be found in the same supply chain, which makes data sharing very difficult [
16
]. Due to these challenges, research on and implementation of traceability are growing slowly. Although there has been work to create supply chain traceability, it is not practical in the actual world. The work demonstrates several procedures in a centralized system's data structures and transparent framework. Researchers' interest in blockchain technology and its application to the supply chain has grown over the last few years [
17
]. Some limitations of the existing research and their techniques are depicted here. The supply chains' global character makes it challenging to achieve the desired traceability. Several methods are implemented to provide better privacy-preserved data transfer in the supply chain network. However, these methods fail to address issues with certificate verifiability and raise concerns about the existence of privacy-sensitive information. A hash network links the blockchain in chronological order. For each node, it has a copy of a ledger, and few mutually distrusting nodes often maintain this hash network. This system provides better confidentiality and non-repudiation over the Ethereum networks, but the cost requirement is high and the system's feasibility low. To overcome these challenges, a novel blockchain-based privacy preservation model is implemented in the Ethereum network to provide better privacy preservation.
The contributions of the designed Ethereum-based privacy preservation model are listed below.
To design a blockchain-based data privacy preservation model with a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm over the supply chain network to secure information exchange and guarantee the privacy of data access in the Ethereum platform. Here, the performance improvement of the proposed model is applicable to different applications regarding cryptocurrency, food supply chains, and sealed-bid auctions.
To generate the key with the help of developed ABC-ROA for exchanging the secured data in the supply chain framework using data restoration and data sanitization procedures in the Ethereum environment. The developed ABC-ROA algorithm is utilized to restore the data from the receiver side. Consequently, it helps to access the original data that can be generated from the original key.
To implement the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm known as ABC-ROA for choosing the best optimal key to maximize the performance of the developed blockchain-based privacy preservation model. Here, the designed ABC-ROA algorithm improves the system's robustness. It is also used to solve complex issues.
To compare the developed ABC-ROA-based privacy preservation system with existing meta-heuristic algorithms using a variety of metrics to verify the performance of the developed model.

In 2021, Lin et al. [
18
] introduced privacy-preserving blockchain architecture (PPChain), and PPChain's design has been changed in Ethereum. PPChain's architecture allowed regulation to provide security. They specifically incorporated cryptographic primitives such as broadcast encryption and group signature into a workable byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with a separation mechanism to remove the transaction fee and mine for a reward instead of using the existing mining model. They offered in-depth security and privacy analysis and a performance study to demonstrate the usefulness of PPChain. Examples from the food supply chain, sealed-bid auctions, and cryptocurrency described how the PPChain might be used in regulation applications. In 2022, Rahmadika et al. [
19
] implemented an efficient architecture for secure misbehavior detection in lightweight IoMT tools in the 'artificial pancreas' model (APS). The suggested method used deep learning, which protected privacy, and boosted security by integrating blockchain technology built on the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem. The efficacy of the developed system has been empirically tested for commensurate incentive schemes, exhaustiveness with compact findings, and an untraceable characteristic from a different neural deep learning technique. Consequently, the model has a high recall rate, demonstrating that it is almost completely capable of identifying harmful events in the case being studied.
In 2022, Xiong et al. [
20
] designed a secure privacy preservation authentication mechanism for inter-constellation collaboration. They created both permanent and transient identities for each satellite to protect privacy. The permanent identity was used for inter-constellation collaboration, whereas the temporary identity was utilized for communication inside the constellation. For information exchange among cooperative satellite constellations, a consortium blockchain was introduced. A replica storage node mechanism has been suggested to enable effective authentication with minimal resources, where well-resourced satellites cache the duplicated data exchanged across the blockchain. A branch-and-bound approach has been used to address the integer programming issue of choosing the replica storage node. According to a security study, the suggested authentication technique was secure against various possible attacks, which included formal analysis using informal verification and BAN Logic. The suggested system provided efficiency in communication overheads, signaling, and processing with greater performance, based on a comparison between it and other privacy preservation schemes. Evaluations showed that the suggested onboard caching approach achieved minimal storage costs and communication delay.
In 2022, Singh et al. [
21
] implemented a privacy preservation model in smart healthcare using a blockchain-based federated learning method for preserving privacy, which used IoT cloud platforms to provide privacy and security. Scalable machine learning applications such as health-care use federated learning technologies. Users could also utilize a well-trained deep learning system without putting their private information in the cloud. Additionally, it covered the uses of federated learning in a smart city's distributed secure environment. In 2020, Guo et al. [
22
] implemented a blockchain-based privacy preservation system in the Ethereum network to provide better privacy preservation data. In that model, they used various mechanisms in the blockchain. Privacy protection and analyzing anonymity methods were used in digital currency. The aim of the encryption mechanism was focused on the privacy protection scheme. 
In 2022, Mohan et al. [
23
] designed the proof of authority (PoA) consensus process, which required little computational power, and it has been implemented on a Raspberry Pi network. The elliptic integrated encryption process used a double-encryption process to protect the secrecy of data. With a speed of at least 25 transactions per second, it has been reported to perform well in contrast to previous systems. It was also readily expandable to accommodate various health-care workers. A new range of real-time health monitoring tools with excellent security and data privacy might come from further work on this concept, potentially leading to significant innovation in the IoMT sector. In 2018, Elisa et al. [
24
] developed a model for a decentralized deep learning e-government system utilizing a blockchain framework that guaranteed data confidentiality and privacy and boosted public sector confidence. A prototype of the suggested system was also provided, supported by a theoretical and in-depth examination of the system's security and privacy consequences.
In 2022, Dewangan et al. [
25
] suggested a system that used tokens to create pupils' identities and saved them in a file system. The suggested model used SHA-256 for cryptographic hashing, Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA), and IPFS for digital signature and verification. The results of this suggested method show the transaction speed, the time needed for validating and signing a transaction, and the time needed for each transaction. They evaluated the privacy, transaction costs, huge file storage, blockchain registration, and implementation costs of this system to those of the already built solutions.
Personal information is stolen by many hackers and intruders, so privacy preservation is much needed nowadays. Personal data information theft, virus threats, and spamming are illegal activities. However, limited hardware resources in IoT applications, including network bandwidth, computing power, and storage pose unique challenges to the blockchain. Therefore, various researchers have developed efficient technique to secure the data along with the blockchain technology.

:


In the present, many organizations grow on a daily basis, using many assets to perform their activities and generate profit. In large organizations, all of these assets must be managed, occasionally leading to challenges depending on the organization's size. For this reason, the role of asset custodian is needed. This role entails assigning the fixed assets to one person for their care, maintenance, and safekeeping. In this process, it is necessary to update information in the central system, leading to further administrative processes, which, in the majority of cases, are carried out through traditional methods. This involves time to obtain wet signatures, a great deal of paperwork, and time for the person or people in charge to update the information. Due to these reasons, the process can be updated partially or entirely to use digital means in order to solve the mentioned inconveniences. This paper presents a proof-of-concept system to offer a modernized and practical solution to this problem using the advantages of blockchain technology, and speeding up the process by using assets identified with UHF RFID technology to permit the reading of many tags that can be embedded and hidden with no need for line-of-sight, allowing fast ownership transfer, using smart contracts in the Ethereum private blockchain.


 










 


Asset management is not new. People and organizations have been managing assets for a very long time; however, it was not until the 1980s that the term 'asset management' started to be used in the private and public sectors. To manage assets properly, an entire system is required, including the organization's structure, roles, and responsibilities, planning, operation, etc. All of these considerations are included in the international standard ISO 55000 for asset management [
1
]. For this reason, commonly in the case of large organizations such as universities, the role of asset custodian is needed; by using this role, the fixed assets are assigned to one person. Generally, this person is the main user of the element. In some cases, this person needs to be part of the organization in a full-time position, as the person responsible for the care, maintenance, and safe-keeping of the asset, for assurance that the element is used only for official business, and for verifying the accuracy of the information contained in the organizational information systems related to the elements in their charge, including history, value, and relevant characteristics [
2
]. Frequently, all information related to assets is stored in database servers, allowing more speed and flexibility in the information query process, and in some cases, the assets are identified using a visual bi-dimensional form of identification, such as bar-codes or QR codes [
2
]. This kind of identification requires a direct line of sight between the reader and the code. Methods such as this save time. However, systems used to manage these registers become more complex over time. For the identification of assets, new technologies emerge and evolve to become more useful and faster; for example, far-field RFID technology permits the reading of many tags that can be embedded and hidden with no need for line-of-sight. They can be read through different materials, such as wood, plastic, cardboard, and almost any non-metallic material. There are many types of harsh environments, such as outdoors, chemically exposed environments, moist environments, and environments of unusual temperatures. This technology permits read distances in the range of 16 m away from the reader for passive tags and 100 m away for active tags [
3
]. For example, these are applied to manage numerous objects in supply chain environments [
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
].
Independently from an organization's activities, they possess different elements which play a role or have a function in the execution of a process. Furthermore, the relevant characteristics of these assets include a monetary value in the company balance sheet, being listed in a central record, deterioration by use, and depreciation over time [
8
]. Between these assets are those used by staff in their daily activities, including computational resources, machines, buildings, etc. The elements with these characteristics are classified as fixed assets. Additionally, to maintain control and traceability of the history and current value of the fixed assets, organizations keep registers that include all relevant information for each fixed asset in their life cycle. As a result, many aspects need to be managed and administered with the support of the responsible person.
The management of the information generated in the process of asset control in the present is controlled using centralized systems to organize and implement the data and management procedures [
9
]. This type of system can lead to inconveniences over time; for example, imprecise Building  Modelling definitions, isolated software development, data interoperability, intellectual property, virtual property rights, skills and training requirements [
10
], and in the case of some organizations, many paper forms and wet signatures. These inconveniences lead to high time consumption for tasks such as the transfer of responsibilities over assets.
Consequently, in this paper, we address these inconveniences and demonstrate a solution to transfer the responsibility for assets using the RFID UHF technology for agile asset identification, which is steadily becoming more popular in the IoT environment [
11
]. Additionally, we demonstrate a method to use all the advantages offered by the blockchain by managing assets using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with high encryption security and functional flexibility through the use of smart contracts, and to inherit properties such as integrity, auditability, and transparency. Finally, to exploit all of these advantages, we deploy a proof-of-concept scenario integrating these technologies in a distributed application (DAPP) to obtain feedback on the viability of the solution. In the remainder of this paper, we explore the main aspects of the DAPP, the details of the proposed solution, including the relevant characteristics and architecture details in the way the technologies communicate with each other, and demonstrate the results obtained in the deployment of the proof-of-concept solution, followed by the discussion and conclusion sections.
Consider the following scenario presented in 
Figure 1
. An employee of the organization, Thomas, needs to transfer the ownership of his printer to Mary. To accomplish this task, he and Mary need to fill and sign out an internal form. Additionally, it is necessary to obtain validation from Jim, the manager, in some cases. Then, this form needs to be delivered to the inventory division of the organization to validate the information and update the inventory register; to accomplish this, they need to contact the database administrator, Paul, to complete the process. Finally, Paul tells Thomas to hand the printer to Mary physically, concluding the process. Nevertheless, in organizational environments, ownership transfer is always a centralized process and requires many agents for a successful and authorized assignment. Additionally, reaching all the people involved creates an unsafe environment for the information concerned, where it can be lost or altered at any of these stages. Finally, the total control of the information is delegated to Paul, the database administrator. Under these circumstances, the process can generate a high consumption of time and an unsafe environment for information, focusing the responsibility for the process on selected people who act as mediums to make the process possible.
As mentioned in the introduction, this proof-of-concept solution is deployed in an organizational context; for its first iteration, the application is intended to be used in the area of inventory, where all the knowledge about the management and administration of assets are located, including accountability, maintenance, life cycle, and administrative procedures. We select this area because it helps to identify the requirements for the ownership transfer automation process and because the workers in this area can act as custodians and be in charge of the computers, printers, furniture, and other assets used for their daily activities. Additionally, participation in this area contributes important feedback for the process, received directly from personnel experience and expertise.
Initially, the prototype focuses on the basic requirements for inventory and ownership transfer processes, including the following aspects:
An audit consists of the revision of documents, inventories, and other physical and documented evidence to ensure that the audited entity is following the defined procedures implemented by the organization [
17
]. In this particular case, we need to apply internal auditing, as this activity is defined as an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve the organization's operations [
18
]; in this case, we want to store all the records to complete this task.
This process can be performed using new disruptive technologies; these systems keep records of ownership and transaction timestamps, eliminating the possibility of digital copying and, thus, double-spending [
19
]. Additionally, the usage of smart contracts can evolve business practices by enhancing efficiency and transparency in the value chain. The fusion of these innovations is also likely to transform auditing by automating workflows, but, more importantly, by enhancing audit effectiveness and reporting [
20
]. Blockchain technology is designed to store information about transactions to be immutable over time, storing the information using hash technologies, and increasing the accuracy and trustworthiness of records [
19
]. Although blockchain technology is new, it will require auditors to develop and employ new approaches to assessing this new technology using well-established professional standards to ensure adequate assurances [
21
]. Blockchain technology, thanks to its characteristics (transparency, traceability, and integration of rules and procedures in the technology itself) [
19
] is becoming an essential tool used in government, such as in Canada, where many state dependencies are already involved. An example is the Toronto-based Blockchain Research Institute (blockchainresearchinstitute.org).
The use of this technology has some consequential, unanticipated effects on the auditor professions, requiring auditors to become more IT- rather than accounting-oriented, and creating a change in the auditor's profile in this new disruptive system [
19
].
Although the blockchain is a relatively newly adopted technology, we can see significant advances in making it more accessible and available for the end user. With the development and release of new tools and mechanisms to verify and analyze data stored in blockchains using web dashboards [
22
], blockchains can be applied to the authentication and verification of identity to replace the usage of classic passwords [
23
], or alternatively to the development of new frameworks to test and develop fine-tuned blockchain applications [
24
]. Additionally, blockchains have been used to create electronic wallets to be used in daily devices, such as laptops and cellphones, such as the library MetaMask 
(https://metamask.io/
, accessed on 5 September 2022), which can be installed as an extension in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave) to use cryptocurrencies and run compatible DAPPS (distributed applications) using deployed smart contracts.
Integrity is one of the basic inherent characteristics of blockchain technology. In the blockchain system, the information is defined as a linked list of immutable tamper-proof blocks stored in each participating node. Each block records a set of transactions and the associated metadata. Blockchain transactions act on the identical ledger data stored in each node. [
25
] The blockchain was initially concieved by Satoshi Nakamoto [
26
]. For this reason, blockchains are used to mainly store and register all movements in the electronic currency known as Bitcoin, reaching values per unit far beyond any official currency from any country in the world. This shows a high level of trust that can be used as a reference for the level of integrity the technology manages.
The critical element of any blockchain system is the existence of an immutable tamper-proof block. In its simplest form, a block is an encrypted aggregation of a set of transactions. The existence of a block acts as a guarantee that the transactions have been executed and verified [
25
]. Some examples of the integrity offered by blockchains are: cloud data integrity protection [
27
], data integrity verification for large-scale IoT data [
28
], and the integration of any data to be hashed and verified any time using the tampering protection offered by blockchain technology [
29
].
The auditability and integrity are essential inherent characteristics of blockchain technology. In contrast, ease of use needs to be explored more deeply to implement a usable interface for the user that makes the ownership transfer of RFID UHF identified assets possible. After the booth parts agree on the transfer, the current custodian and the new receiver, in some cases, may require a supervisor's approbation to carry out the transfer of the asset and be added securely to the blockchain, using secure personal accounts in the blockchain. This will be reviewed in more detail in the following sections.
In this study, we used Ethereum Solidity smart contracts to manage user information and provide a means for users to access the data contained in the blockchain using a web interface based on libraries such as WEB3.js and META MASK wallet, and a gateway to blockchain apps, viable to be used in Chrome and other web browsers and Android or iOS mobile applications.
The contracts in Ethereum can be expressed as computer programs with well-defined semantics, using Solidity language that allows a well-defined design and flexible functionality. On the other hand, Bitcoin contracts work in a different way using a limited script structure and cryptographic protocols, where participants send/receive messages, verify signatures, and put/search transactions on the blockchain [
25
]; for this reason, Ethereum was selected as a base blockchain server to implement the smart contracts to manipulate and register all the changes to be handled by the distributed application, including the register of user accounts, the register of the active assets that the organization uses for its missions, and the necessary relations to have the role of custodian of one asset using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to hold and reference every asset registered by the DAPP. This token is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. [
30
] This NFT is part of the blockchain technology and, due to its nature, can be used by the smart contracts to expand its functionality; in this case, to be used as a unique ID of every asset, and allowing it to be traded, following the rules defined and programed in the smart contract developed in Solidity.
Deployment in this scenario uses a private blockchain with two predefined users to control the register process of the assets and the repeatability delegation, but it is possible to deploy the same smart contracts using the Ethereum public networks. However, in the main public networks, we cannot control the data chain and the users that have access, and the costs of running the DAPP in the blockchain in exchange for the costs of infrastructure can be left aside.
The server and miner can be wrapped as Docker containers, allowing the creation of new nodes to spread and grow the network while decreasing the complexity through version control in medium and small deployments; for reference, we include the parameters used to run Geth for the initial node in 
Table 1
, and the parameters to run a miner instance in 
Table 2
. The fields with N/A do not receive parameters.
After the blockchain is deployed, it is necessary to provide a user interface to the users interested in our DAPP; for this, we use frameworks such as nodeJs for smart-contract generation and ReactJs for the user interface. Additionally, we use libraries such as Ethers to interact with the smart-contract functions and truffle to translate the contracts written in Solidity language(.sol) to JSON format and be imported and used using Ethers. Finally, we use the openzeppelin library to implement the interaction and implementation of the standard for managing assets using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) normalized by the standard ERC-721. All the tokens generated have a globally unique 256 bit variable called tokenId; this value is often used in DAPPs to generate visual outputs, such as obtaining a unique variant of an image of a cat, alien, or abilities in a game. All of this is an aleatory result and provides fun in some games, and it cannot be considered to have real worth, despite attempts to argue otherwise in mediums such as media galleries and games. In contrast, the correct usage may be the identification and proof of ownership for objects from the real world.
All the web implementation runs in a server and exposes a web application to be available via HTTPS protocol over the Internet, allowing interaction with the blockchain smart contract through the web browser plugin MetaMask and allowing DAPP interoperability through JavaScript libraries; this can be observed in 
Figure 2

It is important to keep in mind the codification of the tags; in this case, we implemented the RFID application to use the Fast-ID functionality. With this configuration, the reader uses the Electronic Product Code (EPC) programmed by the user, and the Tag Identification (TID), a read-only code programmed in the factory, to identify every produced TAG. This results in a unique code to prevent and reduce counterfeit, duplicity, and false-positive identifications.

On 15 September 2022, the Ethereum network adopted a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. We study the impact on the network and competing platforms in a two month event window around the Beacon chain merge. We find that the transition to PoS has reduced energy consumption by 99.98%. Miners have not transformed into validators, and total block reward income (in USD) has fallen by 97%, though transaction fees (in ETH) for Ether have increased nearly 10%. The Herfindahl index for the top 10 is 1009; the network is 19% less concentrated after the merge. Ethereum supply growth has been deflationary since the merge. The time between consecutive blocks is now steady at 12 s and transactions per day are up 7.0%. On Polygon, Matic fees rose but token fees fell. Polygon also slows, processing 3.3% fewer transactions per day. Solana's fees fall by 
$
0.0003, and transactions per day are down 48%. Stablecoin transfer volumes fall on Ethereum and Polygon, but rise on Solana.


 










 


The Ethereum blockchain began operation on 30 July 2015. For more than seven years, the chain was secured by a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. This entailed large clusters of specialized computers, known as mining networks, competing with one another to find a random number called the nonce. The first miner to show that the hash of the nonce was below the network's difficulty level would be allowed to add the new block to the chain. The miner would receive a block reward and collect gas fees for the transactions included in the block. As the network difficulty increased, the energy resources consumed by the miners grew ever larger.
On 13 August 2022, the electricity consumption of the network, using the methodology of de Vries [
1
], reached a peak, briefly consuming 93.975 Terrawatt hours (TWh) per year on an annualized basis. (McDonald [
2
] estimates a peak usage of 89 TwH.) An alternative, more conservative methodology of Krause and Tolaymat [
3
] estimates peak usage at 45% of de Vries [
1
]. For context, this annualized estimate exceeds the estimated yearly usage by the Philippines in 2018. (US Energy  Administration [
4
]).
Vitalik Buterin, founder of the network, had advocated for a transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) as early as 2016. (Buterin [
5
]) This validation method requires stakers to verify new transactions. Instead of searching randomly for the nonce, stakers place their Ethereum holdings into a smart contract as collateral. If stakers fail to fulfill their validation responsibilities–accidentally or maliciously–they can be punished by losing their staked coins. Stakers for any given block are chosen via a pseudo-random algorithm known as RANDAO. (Randao.org [
6
]) Edgington [
7
] provides a more comprehensive discussion about RANDAO, and Park et al. [
8
] contains details on Ethereum's implementation of PoS.
Since PoS forgoes the energy-intensive problem solving characteristic of proof-of-work (Baniata and Kertesz [
9
] show that fog computing techniques can substantially reduce energy consumption in PoW distributed ledgers.), the Ethereum transition to PoS has cut the electricity usage of the network to 0.015 Terra Watts per hour, a 99.98% decrease, as seen in 
Figure 1
.
We describe the first six transition blocks in 
Table 1
. The last block mined under PoW (
https://etherscan.io/block/15537393
. Accessed on 25 September 2022.) was 15537393 by F2 Pool Old at 6:42:42 AM GMT on 15 September 2022. It included only one ERC-721 (NFT) transaction. The first PoS block (The block was in slot 4700013, epoch 146875. A slot is a time period of 12 s in which a validator can propose a block. There are 32 slots in one epoch.) 15537394 was a normal sized block(
https://etherscan.io/block/15537393
. Accessed on 25 September 2022.) with 80 transactions, but it included a 45 Ether (ETH) priority fee (tip).
We will drop the transition day, 15 September, analyzing one month event windows preceding and following that date.
This paper will examine the composition of the validator pool, block fees and rewards, and the network speed, on the Ethereum network. Our data sources are the Ethereum blockchain which we obtain from Kaggle. (
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bigquery/ethereum-blockchain
. Accessed on 25 October 2022.) Data from the pre-merge Beacon Chain is from Bitquery. (
https://explorer.bitquery.io/eth2
. Accessed on 25 October 2022.) We will also compare Ethereum to Polygon and Solana on fees, speed and transfer volumes. The Polygon data are from Quicknode, (
https://www.quicknode.com/docs/polygon
. Accessed on 25 October 2022.) and the Solana data are from its' command line interface. (
https://docs.solana.com/cli
. Accessed on 25 October 2022.) For Solana, we use 25,000 slot slices from each epoch in the month before and after the merge.
Our summary statistics are averages of fees, transactions per day, and transfer volumes. Since all are very large samples, we use 
t
-tests to compare the means before and after the merge and report 
p
-values from the normal distribution.
Prior to the merge, blocks were added by the miners. For the period 14 August to 14 September 2022, we computed the number of blocks and associated transactions that each miner completed. The top 10 miners, by blocks completed, are in 
Table 2
. The Herfindahl index for the top ten is 1245. Ethermine has the largest market share at 28.6%.
Blocks are now secured by validators, participants in the Ethereum 2.0 consensus algorithm who have placed at least 32 ETH into the deposit contract (
https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa
. Accessed on 25 October 2022.) which we describe in 
Table 3
. A committee of at least 128 validators, selected by RANDAO, are chosen to add a block for any given slot. One participant, called the block proposer, forms the block, a process that entails selecting and verifying a set of transactions has no failures or errors. The block then needs to be confirmed by the remaining validators, called attesters, who check and give their vote of confidence to the block. Finality is achieved at the checkpoint block, the first block in the next epoch, with support from 2/3 of the staked ETH. (
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/finality
. Accessed on 25 October 2022.)
The randomness of selection means that validators must have an active system nearly 24/7; they can have some or all of their stake burned (A term used to describe ETH that is cut loose from the network and is thus inaccessible to any user.) and be removed slashed) from the set of validators, for failing to complete an assigned task. As of 1 November 2022, 217 validators have been slashed, (
https://beaconcha.in/validators/slashings
. Accessed on 1 November 2022.) 24 since the merge.
In order to incentivize ETH holders to stake in the network, validators are compensated in two ways. The block proposer claims the gas fees, net of burning. Validators also receive rewards for attesting to and finalizing blocks. (
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/
. Accessed on 7 October 2022.) This reward is a function of the total network stake, with the return inversely proportional to the square root of the number of validators.
We plot the cumulative deposits into the staking contract in 
Figure 2
. Deposits to the Beacon Chain staking contract began in November 2020. Heading into the merge the total supply in the deposit contract exceeded 13.2 million Ether.
Pintail [
11
] provides estimates of the returns to staking Ethereum on the Beacon Chain which draws on the Ethereum 2.0 annotated specification of Edgington [
7
]. With 401,084 validators on the merge day, this model estimates a return of 1.49 ETH over the year, an annualized yield of 4.64%. If the number of validators were to double, the return would fall to 1.05 ETH or just 3.28%.
We computed the number of blocks and transactions that each validator proposed from 16 September to 16 October 2022. The top 10 validators by blocks completed can be seen in 
Table 4
. The Herfindahl index for the top 10 is 1009;the network is 19% less concentrated after the merge.
Moreover, there is no overlap between the pre-merge miners and the post-merge validators. Miners' comparative advantage is their computing power, but this does not give a meaningful leg-up for PoS validation. Some miners have migrated to other networks that are still using PoW. In fact, the reward for mining an Ethereum Classic or RVN blocks, which still use PoW, dropped roughly 84% and 97%, respectively, within a 24-h period around the merge. (
https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/15/ethereum-miners-are-quickly-dying-less-than-24-hours-after-the-merge/
. Accessed on 1 October 2022.)
The dominant validators are Flashbots, a research collective designed to mitigate the problem of maximum extractable value (MEV), a measure of the profit a network participant can make through 'their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions from the blocks they produce.' (
https://www.flashbots.net/
. Accessed on 25 November 2022.) In other words, since there is no formal regulation around the order of transactions in a block, or which transactions are included in a block, validators could choose to prioritize certain types of transactions, giving those parties systemic advantages when trading. (Jensen [
12
] points out that the opportunity space is much larger if the manipulable set spans multiple blocks. They estimate that more than 20% of the blocks since the merge share single builder entries.)
In the proof of stake regime, Flashbots has released MEV-Boost, an open-source algorithm which sells blockspace to an open market of builders. On 15 September 2022, 17 epochs after the merge, MEV-Boost was activated. BioXroute (
https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/mev-solution/mev-relay-for-validators
. Accessed on 25 November 2022.) and MEV Builder utilize MEV-Boost. (builder 0x69 utilizes two relays, Flashbots and Relayooor, 
https://medium.com/@builder0x69
. Accessed on 25 November 2022.) The four Flashbots addresses have validated 46.6% of the blocks in the month since the merge.
While it may not be computationally intensive, validating requires a large capital commitment, a great deal of technical knowledge, and a round-the-clock connection to the network. There are, however, on- and off-chain methods for retail investors, who would otherwise be locked out due to these stringent demands, to become validators. Validation pools, such as Lido, have been a popular on-chain method of staking–in fact, as seen in 
Table 4
, Lido is the dominant staking pool in the market. Users pool their resources into Lido by purchasing its staking token, stETH. (The hash on the Ethereum Mainnet is 0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84.) Lido then invests the pooled assets into the staking contract, and distributes the rewards amongst the investors. The cumulative amount staked in Lido can be seen in 
Figure 3
. (Heimbach et al. [
13
] note that Lido can also be staked, and that nearly 20% was locked into DeFi lending protocols during the merge, creating a potential for mass liquidations.)
There are also off-chain solutions for retail staking, namely through centralized exchanges. As seen on 
Table 4
, Coinbase is the second largest staker in part due to a service that mirrors Lido's on-chain pooling; Coinbase users can offer any amount of ETH to be pooled and staked in the deposit contract. Other centralized exchanges, like Binance, offer similar services; Kraken offered such a service for the duration of this sample, but have since shut down user stalking pools. Since daily issuance of new ETH to the validators is a function of the total amount of ETH staked, tracking the dominant validators may be important insofar as understanding the growth in ETH supply.
Historically, income for miners has come from two sources: block rewards for completing a new block on the chain and transaction fees from on-chain transfers. Since August 2021, after the EIP-1559 upgrade, (
https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq
. Accessed on 30 September 2022.) base fees from transfers have been burned. A miner's block income, prior to the merge, consisted of these three parts shown in Equation (1):
Block reward is the number of new ETH minted and given to the party responsible for successfully adding a block to the chain; transaction fees, include the gas, both base and priority fees, from the transactions in the block; burnt gas for each transaction is the base fee in ETH set by the network protocol.
Since the St. Petersburg upgrade in 2019, miners received two ETH for each block they completed. However, the transition to PoS removed this reward altogether. Miner and validators' total block income before and after the event is plotted in 
Figure 4
.
Table 5
 decomposes the decline in block income. There is a slight, statistically insignificant rise in transaction fees for transfers, but it is largely offset by a higher burn rate. The loss of a block completion bonus is the main drag on block income. Validators' total block income is now only 3% of what miners used to earn.
The removal of the block completion reward has also greatly slowed the minting of new ETH. Since the St. Petersburg Upgrade, (The updates went live at block 7,280,000 on 28 February 2019: 
https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereums-constantinople-st-petersburg-upgrades-have-been-activated
. Accessed on 30 September 2022.) two new ETH were minted as a reward for each completed block; this served as the main driver of ETH supply expansion. Combined with a smaller issuance for ommer blocks (
https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/ommer
. Accessed on 30 September 2022.) and validators on the Beacon Chain, (
https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/
. Accessed on 30 September 2022.) there was about 5.5 million new ETH minted annually. (
https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/
. Accessed on 30 September 2022.) Since the merge, the two ETH per transaction reward on the execution layer (PoW) are no longer being produced.

Cryptocurrencies are in high demand now due to their volatile and untraceable nature. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are just a few examples. This research seeks to identify deception and probable fraud in Ethereum transactional processes. We have developed this capability via ChaosNet, an Artificial Neural Network constructed using Generalized Luröth Series maps. Chaos has been objectively discovered in the brain at many spatiotemporal scales. Several synthetic neuronal simulations, including the Hindmarsh–Rose model, possess chaos, and individual brain neurons are known to display chaotic bursting phenomena. Although chaos is included in several Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for instance, in Recursively Generating Neural Networks, no ANNs exist for classical tasks entirely made up of chaoticity. ChaosNet uses the chaotic GLS neurons' property of topological transitivity to perform classification problems on pools of data with cutting-edge performance, lowering the necessary training sample count. This synthetic neural network can perform categorization tasks by gathering a definite amount of training data. ChaosNet utilizes some of the best traits of networks composed of biological neurons, which derive from the strong chaotic activity of individual neurons, to solve complex classification tasks on par with or better than standard Artificial Neural Networks. It has been shown to require much fewer training samples. This ability of ChaosNet has been well exploited for the objective of our research. Further, in this article, ChaosNet has been integrated with several well-known ML algorithms to cater to the purposes of this study. The results obtained are better than the generic results.

Their innovative approach to transforming Impermanent Loss into Impermanent Gain has attracted more than 
$30 million in total value locked
 (TVL) within just two weeks, making it the fastest-growing protocol on the Ethereum network.
 
Long considered a substantial barrier to entry for liquidity providers, Impermanent Loss has impeded the growth of the DeFi movement. The Swiss researchers' discovery offers a novel way to tackle this challenge, potentially leading to a more secure, transparent, and inclusive financial system. The solution is detailed in a scientific article, which is among the most-read in its category on the Academia platform, and has been published on 
smardex.io
.
 
By utilizing smart contracts and advanced algorithms, the researchers have developed a complex mechanism that mitigates the risks associated with Impermanent Loss. This mechanism, when integrated into decentralized finance platforms, not only protects liquidity providers from potential losses but also rewards them with Impermanent Gain in many instances. Consequently, SmarDex, the team behind smardex.io, has managed to address a significant obstacle for liquidity providers, unlocking new possibilities for the DeFi sector.
 
The implications of this discovery extend beyond DeFi, potentially impacting traditional financial institutions as well. By providing a more secure and efficient financial infrastructure, the researchers' breakthrough could compel these institutions to adapt in response to the rapidly advancing DeFi ecosystem. Embracing decentralized, fully transparent exchanges could also help avoid future disasters like the one at FTX.
 
The widespread adoption of this innovation could lead to far-reaching effects on the global economy. Greater financial inclusion may result, as individuals and businesses previously excluded from traditional financial systems gain access to various services. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of this breakthrough could contribute to a more stable and resilient financial ecosystem, better equipped to handle economic shocks and crises.
 
As the world faces the challenges of centralized financial systems, the Swiss researchers' innovation offers a new approach to decentralized finance that could have significant implications for the global economy. The rapid growth of their protocol, evidenced by the $30 million TVL milestone in just two weeks, underscores the impact their solution may have on the future of finance.

Today all of that money is taken by the searcher, but why shouldn't it be split with the people who create the value?
 
 
Berlin, Germany (PRWEB)
 
April 07, 2023
 
 Maximal extractable value (MEV) is a $1.3 billion dollar problem for the Ethereum ecosystem. Whenever DeFi users make trades, buy NFTs, register ENS names, or provide liquidity to liquidity pools, their transactions risk being hijacked by MEV bots that are able to act in milliseconds and undercut a real user's trade, resulting in worse prices for genuine users.
 
Now, top Ethereum projects have come together to solve this issue: MEV Blocker is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) solution developed to tackle this problem and give power back to the users.

Before sending transactions to the mempool, MEV Blocker directs them to a network of 'searchers' that bid for the right to backrun the transactions while shielding users from frontrunning and sandwich attacks. MEV Blocker sends 90% of the profits from winning bids back to users and 10% to validators as a reward. 
 
In this way MEV Blocker not only prevents 'harmful' MEV in the form of frontrunning and sandwich attacks, but it also helps users capture much of the surplus created by their transactions — something most are missing out on today.
 
Martin Köppelmann, CEO of Gnosis said, 'It's particularly exciting that, with the launch of MEV Blocker, users can profit from the back running opportunities they create. Today all of that money is taken by the searcher, but why shouldn't it be split with the people who create the value?' 
 
The MEV Blocker RPC endpoint was jointly developed by CoW Swap, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is fast, free and censorship-resistant. To enjoy the full benefits of MEV Blocker, users simply add the RPC endpoint to their wallets and use Ethereum-based dApps as they normally would.
 
Felix Leupold, CTO of CoW Swap shared, 'At CoW Protocol, our philosophy has always been to minimize MEV and capture its value for the users of Ethereum. While CoW Swap is a great MEV solution for token swaps, with MEV Blocker we are now launching a more general and even simpler solution to protect Ethereum users from all kinds of MEV.'

Consumer knowledge of the goods produced or processed by the numerous suppliers and processors is still relatively low due to the growing complexity of the structure of pharmaceutical supply chains.  asymmetry in the pharmaceutical sector has an effect on welfare, sustainability, and health.

In this paper, we present a secure datastore based on an Ethereum smart contract. Our research is guided by three research questions. First, we will explore to what extend a smart-contract-based datastore should resemble a traditional database system. Second, we will investigate how to store the data in a smart-contract-based datastore for maximum flexibility while minimizing the gas consumption. Third, we seek answers regarding whether or not a smart-contract-based datastore should incorporate complex processing such as data encryption and data analytic algorithms. The proposed smart-contract-based datastore aims to strike a good balance between several constraints: (1) smart contracts are publicly visible, which may create a confidentiality concern for the data stored in the datastore; (2) unlike traditional database systems, the Ethereum smart contract programming language (i.e., Solidity) offers very limited data structures for data management; (3) all operations that mutate the blockchain state would incur financial costs and the developers for smart contracts must make sure sufficient gas is provisioned for every smart contract call, and ideally, the gas consumption should be minimized. Our investigation shows that although it is essential for a smart-contract-based datastore to offer some basic data query functionality, it is impractical to offer query flexibility that resembles that of a traditional database system. Furthermore, we propose that data should be structured as tag-value pairs, where the tag serves as a non-unique key that describes the nature of the value. We also conclude that complex processing should not be allowed in the smart contract due to the financial burden and security concerns. The tag-based secure datastore designed this way also defines its applicative perimeter, i.e., only applications that align with our strategy would find the proposed datastore a good fit. Those that would rather incur higher financial cost for more data query flexibility and/or less user burden on data pre- and post-processing would find the proposed database too restrictive.


 










 


Data security is of paramount importance for all systems [
1
,
2
]. Traditionally, data are stored in relational database systems or NoSQL datastores [
3
]. Unfortunately, data stored this way are not only vulnerable to theft, but could easily be modified as well [
4
,
5
]. While data theft clearly is a security breach, compromised data could lead to more serious integrity problems [
6
]. Blockchain technology [
7
], on the other hand, offers a new way of storing data with the immutability property if the blockchain system has sufficient scale [
8
].
There are primarily two ways of storing data with the blockchain [
7
]. One way is to store data directly as part of a transaction, which is possible for most public blockchain systems. The other way is to store data via a smart contract. Directly storing data as part of a transaction costs much less and it is also much less complex than using a smart contract [
9
]. However, directly storing data as part of a blockchain transaction suffers from several limitations: (1) there is no access control over who may write the data to the blockchain and who may read the data from the blockchain; (2) there is no support for querying the data stored in the blockchain systematically, i.e., one would have to know the transaction hash to locate the particular transaction; (3) the amount of data can be packed into a transaction is very limited due to the predefined transaction structure.
While using a smart contract may address all three issues, there is a lack of universally accepted guidelines on designing secure datastore based on smart contracts. The current study is an attempt towards this goal and is driven by three research questions. First, we will explore to what extend a smart-contract-based datastore should resemble a traditional database system. Second, we will investigate how to store the data in a smart-contract-based datastore for maximum flexibility while minimizing the gas consumption. Third, we seek answers regarding whether or not a smart-contract-based datastore should incorporate complex processing such as data encryption and data analytic algorithms. The proposed smart-contract-based datastore aims to strike a good balance between several constraints: (1) smart contracts are publicly visible, which may create a confidentiality concern for the data stored in the datastore; (2) unlike traditional database systems, the Ethereum smart contract programming language (i.e., Solidity) offers very limited data structures for data management; (3) all operations that mutate the blockchain state would incur financial costs and the developers for smart contracts must make sure sufficient gas is provisioned for every smart contract call, and ideally, the gas consumption should be minimized.
Our investigation shows that although it is essential for a smart-contract-based datastore to offer some basic data query functionality, it is impractical to offer query flexibility that resembles that of a traditional database system. Defining a complex schema for highly structured data as commonly used in traditional database systems could compromise the confidentiality because the smart contract is publicly visible. Adopting a more complex structure for data storage in a smart contract would significantly increase the financial cost (in terms of gas consumption) for insertion operations. Furthermore, Solidity lacks built-in support for some database system features, such as the auto increment primary key. Hence, it is both desirable and necessary to adopt basic structures for data storage and for data query.
Furthermore, we propose that data should be structured as tag-value pairs, where the tag serves as a non-unique key that describes the nature of the value. This idea is inspired by the pervasive use of key-value pairs in modern NoSQL datastore and in Ethereum. We intentionally allow the tag to be non-unique so that multiple data entries may share the same tag. This design offers a high degree of flexibility for applications. For example, in sensing data logging, it may be desirable to use the same tag for all data generated by the same sensor in the same day [
10
]. We note that this design allows the users to insert tag-value pairs with unique tags.
We also conclude that complex processing should not be allowed in a smart contract due to the financial burden and security concerns [
11
,
12
]. While adding complex processing could improve the usability of the datastore because the users are relieved from having to perform such processing, the complexity of the smart contract could be drastically increased. Higher complexity could sharply increase the gas consumption and increase the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities to the smart contract [
11
,
12
].
The tag-based secure datastore designed this way also defines its applicative perimeter, i.e., only applications that align with the chosen answers to the research questions would find the proposed datastore a good fit. Those who would rather incur higher financial cost for better data query flexibility and/or less user burden on data pre- and post-processing would find the proposed database too restrictive. We follow a design principle that if an operation can be conducted off-chain (i.e., outside the smart contract), then the operation should be moved out of the smart contract to keep the smart contract as simple as possible. A simple smart contract would not only reduce gas consumption, but also minimize the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities. Another apparent applicative perimeter is that the proposed datastore is based on Ethereum. Users who wish to use other public blockchains would have to port our design to the desirable blockchain.
We argue that the tag-based datastore provides the best tradeoff for query flexibility, data confidentiality, smart contract security, and minimizing the financial cost of the datastore. The first benefit of this design is that it helps protect the confidentiality of the data stored in the datastore. By encoding the tag and the data as strings, it is difficult for an adversary to understand what the original data are. The encoding method can be as simple as mapping the type of sensor (e.g., temperature) to an integer and can be as complex as encrypting the data using AES. The datastore itself does not care how the tag and the data entry are encoded, i.e., the datastore treats the tag and data as opaque objects and only offers storage and query functionalities. The user of the datastore gets to decide the level of protection of the tag and the data entry. Indeed, this aligns with the guideline for designing smart contracts [
11
].
The second benefit of this design is simplicity. By treating the tag and the data as opaque objects, the insertion and query operations become simple and much less error-prone.
The third benefit of this design is flexibility. In addition to the flexibility for achieving data confidentiality as we mentioned earlier, this design also offers the flexibility of system integration. For applications that only have a small amount of data to log with a low data generation rate, the data can be directly written to the datastore after proper encoding. That said, we caution that even with a moderate data generation rate, storing all data in the datastore via a smart contract will not only incur excessive financial cost, but also may exceed the throughput of the blockchain system. To address this concern, we propose to only store the digest of the data entry in the smart contract and log the full data entry in other peer-to-peer file systems, most notably, the InterPLanetary File System (IPFS) (
https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/
 (accessed on 1 March 2023)). This would minimize the financial cost and significantly lower the throughput demand on the blockchain system. If the generation rate is high, it may be necessary to first aggregate the data and record the hash of the aggregated data in the blockchain, as we have done previously [
13
].
In summary, this paper makes the following research contributions:
In this study, we raise three research questions and present our answers by considering the differences between traditional database systems and Ethereum smart contract. Driven by these research questions, we aim to propose a set of guidelines on datastore design based on Ethereum smart contract;
We introduce a smart contract that functions as the proposed secure datastore. The datastore allows role-based access control and tag-based query of data in the datastore while protecting the data confidentiality. The design of the smart contract is intentionally simple yet flexible that accommodates different data generation rates, different levels of data confidentiality requirements, and different levels of financial budget.
We fully characterize the financial cost (i.e., gas consumption) of the datastore in terms of gas consumption under a variety of scenarios and compare with competing solutions;
We provide the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that integrates the proposed datastore and IPFS, where the smart contract is used to store the digest of each data entry, and the IPFS is used to store the full data entry. We demonstrate the advantages of this integrated solution for secure data storage and retrieval in terms of gas consumption and operation latency.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2
 presents the related work and highlights our research contributions. 
Section 3
 elaborates the details of our smart contract design. 
Section 4
 discusses the system integration issues with the proposed smart contract for secure data storage. 
Section 5
 reports the experimental results. 
Section 6
 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.
This study is about relying on blockchain to securely store data. The related studies reported in the literature can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) custom-built blockchain systems designed specifically for secure data storage (such as [
14
,
15
]); (2) storing data directly in transactions using public blockchains; and (3) storing data in smart contract using public blockchains.
Although the work in the first category has some merit, for example, a system was designed to handle large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) data with data trading functionalities in [
14
], and another system was designed to self-repair corrupted data with local repair groups in [
15
], the proposed systems are not actually implemented, let alone available for other researchers to use for secure data storage. As such, we do not draw comparisons with this line of work.
Studies in the second category predominately used the IOTA distributed ledger IOTA [
16
,
17
]. IOTA was designed to support high-throughput transactions using a direct acyclic graph instead of a single chain of blocks. Furthermore, IOTA does not impose a transaction fee. To mitigate spamming attacks, all clients must perform a moderate amount of proof-of-work in every transaction submitted to the IOTA network. IOTA provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for the construction of a transaction that only contains data. The transaction size in IOTA is limited to 32KB. In 2017, IOTA introduced the masked authenticated message (MAM) to facilitate secure communication between IoT devices and IOTA (
https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js/
 (accessed on 1 March 2023)). A number of studies used IOTA MAM for securing IoT data [
18
,
19
,
20
], for supply chain applications [
21
], for health data sharing [
22
,
23
] and management [
24
,
25
], for manufacturing applications [
26
,
27
], for securing industry control [
28
], for securing system logs [
29
], for securing vehicular networks [
30
,
31
], and for securing power systems [
32
].
Previously, we also focused on using IOTA to store sensing data securely [
10
]. The system adopted a hierarchical aggregation scheme for the sensing data [
33
] to reduce the amount of data to be placed on IOTA. Recently, we extended the work to store sensing data directly in the data field of Ethereum transactions [
13
]. Our previous work has a number of limitations as a result of storing of data directly as part of blockchain transactions. A major concern of the approach is the lack of user access control regarding who may upload the data into the blockchain. Not addressing this issue could lead to serious security issues because the integrity of the data may be compromised if adversaries could upload faulty data to the blockchain. Second, the data stored in the blockchain are publicly accessible, which could present confidentiality and privacy issues. By adding user access control, we address both concerns. Third, it is difficult to query the data stored in the blockchain. One would have to know the transaction hash to retrieve the data stored in a particular transaction. In [
13
], we proposed a workaround by introducing an indexing scheme. However, the indexing data must also be stored securely. If the indexing data are compromised or lost, data query would not be possible. In the current study, the datastore offers the functionality of data queries.
In the remainder of this section, we consider related studies in the third category. We note that although there is a large body of work on smart contract applications and this line of work has been well reviewed (for example, [
34
,
35
]), most such studies focus on using smart contracts for access control and coordination. A small fraction of studies are dedicated to secure data storage using smart contracts. An even smaller fraction of studies provided details on smart contract operations for secure data storage and retrieval [
36
,
37
,
38
,
39
], which are the only works directly related to our current study. We discuss these studies by looking at how they responded to the three research questions.
Most studies attempted to develop smart contracts for data storage in a way similar to traditional database systems from two perspectives: (1) structured data are explicitly specified in the smart contract; and (2) users may query the data in the smart contract using a filter for a result directly needed by the users. These studies are predominately in the biomedical and healthcare domain for medical data storage and query [
36
,
37
,
38
,
40
], and most are winning entries in the 2019 secure genome analysis competition [
36
,
37
].
Ethereum offers limited data structures for data storage and indexing. Data entries may be added into an array of predefined types (such as string or bytes32) or custom types (such as a complex structure with multiple fields). The latter would be quite similar to tables in traditional database systems. However, unlike tables in traditional database systems, there is no need to specific primary keys and the developer must manually keep track of the index to each entry. The only form of indexing in Ethereum is mapping, which is a hash table that maps a key to one or more values. To facilitate data query, one mapping is typically needed for each required filter criterion.
In [
36
], three smart contract solutions that were developed for the 2019 secure genome analysis competition were presented. The three solutions won the first place, the second place, and the honorable mention. The first-place solution is referred to as query index. The second-place solution is referred to as index everything. The honorable mention solution is referred to as dual-scenario indexing.
In query index [
36
], a single mapping and an array are used to store the gene-variant-drug observations, as shown in 
Figure 1
. Each of the gene-variant-drug observations is appended to the array (Step 1 in 
Figure 1
). The value of the mapping is the list of indices to the observation array.

As blockchain technology advances, so has the deployment of smart contracts on blockchain platforms, making it exceedingly challenging for users to explicitly identify application services. Unlike traditional contracts, smart contracts are not written in a natural language, making it difficult to determine their provenance. Automatic classification of smart contracts offers blockchain users keyword-based contract queries and a streamlined effective management of smart contracts. In addition, the advancement in smart contracts is accompanied by security challenges, which are generally caused by domain-specific security breaches in smart contract implementation. The development of secure and reliable smart contracts can be extremely challenging due to domain-specific vulnerabilities and constraints associated with various business logics. Accordingly, contract classification based on the application domain and the transaction context offers greater insight into the syntactic and semantic properties of that class. However, despite initial attempts at classifying Ethereum smart contracts, there has been no research on the identification of smart contracts deployed in transactive energy systems for energy exchange purposes. . In this article, in response to the widely recognized prospects of blockchain-enabled smart contracts towards an economical and transparent energy sector, we propose a methodology for the detection and analysis of energy smart contracts. First, smart contracts are parsed by transforming code elements into vectors that encapsulate the semantic and syntactic characteristics of each term. This generates a corpus of annotated text as a balanced, representative collection of terms in energy contracts. The use of a domain corpus builder as an embedding layer to annotate energy smart contracts in conjunction with machine learning models results in a classification accuracy of 98.34%. Subsequently, a source code analysis scheme is applied to identified energy contracts to uncover patterns in code segment distribution, predominant adoption of certain functions, and recurring contracts across the Ethereum network.

As the use of digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, increases in popularity, phishing scams and other cybercriminal activities on blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum) have also risen. Current methods of detecting phishing in Ethereum focus mainly on the transaction features and local network structure. However, these methods fail to account for the complexity of interactions between edges and the handling of large graphs. Additionally, these methods face significant issues due to the limited number of positive labels available. Given this, we propose a scheme that we refer to as the Bagging Multiedge Graph Convolutional Network to detect phishing scams on Ethereum. First, we extract the features from transactions and transform the complex Ethereum transaction network into three simple inter-node graphs. Then, we use graph convolution to generate node embeddings that leverage the global structural information of the inter-node graphs. Further, we apply the bagging strategy to overcome the issues of data imbalance and the Positive Unlabeled (PU) problem in transaction data. Finally, to evaluate our approach's effectiveness, we conduct experiments using actual transaction data. The results demonstrate that our Bagging Multiedge Graph Convolutional Network (0.877 AUC) outperforms all of the baseline classification methods in detecting phishing scams on Ethereum.


 










 


Ethereum, which provides Turing completeness in smart contracts, has become the largest smart contract platform. Meanwhile, Ether, i.e., the cash in Ethereum, has become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. Hence, it is not surprising that Ethereum has been targeted extensively by cybercriminals. For example, according to the 2022 crypto crime report of Chainalysis, illicit transaction activity has reached an all-time-high value, and scams are the largest form of cryptocurrency-based crime by transaction volume, with over 
$
7.7 billion of cryptocurrency taken from victims worldwide [
1
].
Among the various types of cybercriminal activity on Ethereum, phishing scams are notably prevalent and highly damaging and have garnered significant attention [
2
]. Currently available approaches to the detection of phishing primarily concentrate on identifying the specific characteristics of fraudulent emails and websites [
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
]. However, such methods are ineffective against scams that trick users into transferring cryptocurrency to Ethereum addresses that belong to or are controlled by scammers.
To detect phishing attempts on Ethereum, many novel methods using the transaction network were proposed [
8
,
9
,
10
]. The nodes of the transaction network represent Ethereum accounts, and the edges represent transactions between accounts. Specifically, these models transformed the phishing scam detection task into a node classification task [
11
]. Recently, researchers have constructed a transaction subgraph for each target node and used the features of the transaction subgraph as the features of the target node. Thus, the problem of phishing node detection in the Ethereum transaction network can be converted from a node classification task to a graph classification task [

]. These existing works, however, have some limitations in handling large graphs and have few positive labels.
Figure 1
 is a schematic representation of the Ethereum transaction network, where multiple edges are merged into a single edge and the directions of the edges are hidden. The Ethereum transaction network is a multidigraph and contains rich information about node behavior patterns. From 
Figure 1
, we can identify the following characteristics of the Ethereum transaction network.
There is a very large amount of transaction data. Although only a few dozen nodes are shown in the figure, there are hundreds of edges among the nodes. Thus, it can be concluded that the transaction network is very complex.
There is an intricate relationship between the nodes. 
Figure 1
 shows that the nodes in the transaction network are connected closely with other nodes, and there are multiple edges between nodes.
There is an imbalance in the data. Based on the figure, phishing nodes only account for a small proportion of the data compared to normal nodes, and this indicates that a serious data imbalance problem exists in the Ethereum transaction data.
Based on the observations stated above, we can identify the reason for the limitations in the model's performance. First, a great deal of computational resources are needed to process large-scale transaction data. Second, the intricate relationships mean that naive edge handling approaches can lead to a loss of transaction information. Last but not least, the serious data imbalance problem causes models to inadequately learn phishing features. Most researchers alleviate these challenges via graph sampling (e.g., subgraph extraction) and graph filtering mechanisms. However, these methods have difficulty in obtaining global structural information. The lack of global structural information in the node embedding impacts the final phishing node detection.
Therefore, to fully benefit from the structural information of the transaction network and effectively solve the data imbalance problem, we propose a Bagging Multiedge Graph Convolutional Network (BM-GCN) model. The model simplifies the complex relationships between the nodes by breaking down the entire transaction network into three inter-node graphs. The advantage of this is that it facilitates the extraction of node features while preserving global structure information. The inter-node graph refers to the fact that each pair of nodes (a, b) in the graph has at most two edges, one from a to b and one from b to a. Specifically, in our approach, we preprocess the transaction data and generate three inter-node graphs to represent the property on the transaction graph. Then, the GCN model is utilized as the embedding generation method to make use of structural information in the graph. During the training of the GCN model, a bagging strategy is adopted to mitigate the impact of imbalanced data and unlabeled nodes. Consequently, our model can deal with large-scale data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first example that uses a bagging GCN for the detection of Ethereum phishing scams.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. 
Section 2
 addresses the research related to the subject of this article, and 
Section 3
 presents the motivation for the research. 
Section 4
 describes the BM-GCN model and the strategy that was used when we were training the model. In 
Section 5
, we introduce the method of evaluating the effectiveness of the BM-GCN model and analyze the experimental results. 
Section 6
 summarizes the contributions of this paper and presents our future research plans.
With the development of blockchain technology and the growth of its community, the number of fraud attacks on digital currencies is increasing, and this has prompted researchers to analyze the scams. Vasek et al. [
15
] presented the first survey of Bitcoin-based scams; after gathering and combining the various reports of scams, they categorized the scams into four groups, i.e., Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets, and fraudulent exchanges. Since Ethereum is an extension of Bitcoin, it can also be categorized in these ways.
Bitcoin Ponzi schemes have received a great deal of attention because they are a classical form of economic deception. Vasek et al. [
16
] identified why Ponzi scams occur frequently in this ecosystem. Bartoletti et al. [
17
] analyzed this type of scheme on Ethereum and studied how Ponzi schemes are promoted on the web. To fuel the detection of Ponzi schemes on smart contracts, Chen et al. [
18
] provided an open dataset by gathering real-world samples, and they used a random forest model built on account features and code features to identify latent smart Ponzi schemes.
Phishing scams are among the most severe cybercrimes aimed at Ethereum users, and many efforts have been made to detect phishing [
3
]. Wu et al. [
8
] proposed trans2vec, which used a weighted random walk to generate the embeddings of nodes, and then employed a one-class SVM model to classify the embeddings to detect phishing nodes. Chen et al. [
10
] extracted graph-based cascade features from transaction records and developed a lightGBM-based dual-sampling ensemble algorithm to identify phishing accounts. Chen et al. [
9
] obtained statistics on the transaction information as features of nodes and then used a graph convolutional network (GCN) and autoencoder technology to extract the structural features of the subgraph. The output of the GCN and handcrafted features are concatenated to obtain the final result for classification. To detect potential phishing scammers, Zhang et al. [
14
] proposed a multi-channel graph classification model (MCGC) with multiple feature extraction channels for GNN to extract richer information from the input graph.
Although the approaches mentioned above have been able to complete the detection of Ethereum phishing, their methods of processing graph data are designed for simple subgraphs, thus ignoring the global structural information of the Ethereum transaction network. In addition, they do not work in multiedge graphs. To make full use of the transaction information and structural information, we propose a novel method that transforms the transaction network into some inter-node graphs for feature extraction.
Graph embedding transforms the data on the graph into a low-dimensional space while retaining the graph's structural information and properties as much as possible [
19
]. This operation facilitates subsequent analytical tasks in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Graph embedding methods can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., random walk, matrix decomposition, and deep learning. The basic idea of random-walk-based graph embedding is to utilize SkipGram on a path set sampled by a truncated random walk on the graph data to obtain a node embedding [
20
,
21
]. Matrix decomposition methods factorize a proximity matrix that represents node relationships to obtain the node embedding [
22
]. For example, ProNE [
23
] learns embedding both rapidly and efficiently via matrix factorization with spectral propagation. The core idea of the deep learning methodology is to obtain a graph embedding directly from the graph structure through a deep neural network. For example, Kipf et al. [
24
] proposed the graph convolutional network (GCN), which introduced a variant of convolutional neural networks that can use graphs directly and match neighborhoods in the spatial domain.
The Ethereum transaction network is a multiedge graph with a large number of transactions. In such a graph, phishing nodes generally make up only a tiny percentage of the nodes. Therefore, there are several factors that can impact the classification performance when constructing a phishing node detection scheme on the graph.
Transaction graph has complex inter-node relationships
Generally, in the Ethereum transaction network, there are multiple transactions with varying amounts occurring at different times between two nodes. In other words, there will be multiple adjacent edges between nodes. 
Figure 2
 shows a simple transaction graph with only five nodes. The simple addition of weights leads to the unexpected fusion of the features, which limits the effective utilization of the discrete properties.
Significant imbalance between phishing and normal nodes
In the Ethereum transaction network example presented in [
25
], there were 2,973,489 nodes and 13,551,303 transactions, but only 1165 phishing nodes. In other words, there was a significant imbalance between phishing and normal nodes, which can impact the results of the classification.
The labeling of phishing nodes relies on reports from users of specific websites, such as etherscamdb.info and etherscan.io. In other words, these websites can track phishing incidents only if they are reported, and significant numbers of frauds and scams are not reported [
26
,
27
]. Therefore, having these unknown/undetected phishing nodes in the 'normal node' set can skew and impact the classifier's performance, a situation that is also referred to as a Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning challenge.
We posit the potential of using the following approaches to mitigate the challenges discussed in 
Section 3.1
.
To address the multiedge graph problem, we extract three features from the transactions, i.e., inter-node interaction, transaction time variance, and transaction frequency. For each feature, we replace the edges between two nodes that have the same direction with a single directed edge and construct a feature graph to represent the information contained in the multiedges.
We use the bagging strategy [
28
] to deal with both data imbalances and the PU problem. In doing so, we use bootstrap aggregating techniques to leverage unlabeled data and mitigate the limitations associated with the PU problem. In addition, the sampling method used in the bagging strategy also minimizes the impact of the imbalance in the data on the classification results.
Due to the complexity of Ethereum transaction networks, the use of GCN directly in the original network cannot effectively encode the topology around the nodes. Therefore, we consider extracting features from the original transaction network and transforming the complex network into three simple graphs, i.e., a node interaction graph, a time variance graph, and a transaction frequency graph. Then, we use the corresponding adjacency matrices, 




A


i




, 




A


v




, and 




A


f




, to represent the three feature graphs (see also 
Figure 3
). Note that the transactions are directed and the matrices are not symmetrical.
Transaction records provide a significant amount of information to build inter-node graphs. For example, if many transaction records exist between node 
i
 and node 
j
, there will be a closer relationship between these nodes than between nodes with fewer interactions.

The wide application of Ethereum smart contracts in the Internet of Things, finance, medical, and other fields is associated with security challenges. Traditional detection methods detect vulnerabilities by stacking hard rules, which are associated with the bottleneck of a high false-positive rate and low detection efficiency. To make up for the shortcomings of traditional methods, existing deep learning methods improve model performance by combining multiple models, resulting in complex structures. From the perspective of optimizing the model feature space, this study proposes a vulnerability detection scheme for Ethereum smart contracts based on metric learning and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. First, the source code of the Ethereum contract is preprocessed, and the word vector representation is used to extract features. Secondly, the representation is combined with metric learning and the BiLSTM model to optimize the feature space and realize the cohesion of similar contracts and the discreteness of heterogeneous contracts, improving the detection accuracy. In addition, an attention mechanism is introduced to screen key vulnerability features to enhance detection observability. The proposed method was evaluated on a large-scale dataset containing four types of vulnerabilities: arithmetic vulnerabilities, re-entrancy vulnerabilities, unchecked calls, and inconsistent access controls. The results show that the proposed scheme exhibits excellent detection performance. The accuracy rates reached 88.31%, 93.25%, 91.85%, and 90.59%, respectively.


 










 


A smart contract is a transaction protocol that runs on the upper layer of the blockchain. Relying on the unforgeable, tamper-proof, traceable, and decentralized features of the blockchain, smart contracts provide complete transaction services for applications in different fields [
1
]. The Ethereum platform is currently one of the most widely used blockchain platforms for smart contracts. It has launched a Turing-complete smart contract programming language, Solidity, which is widely used in financial services, power supply systems, the Internet of Things, and the medical field [
2
]. In 2015, Fabian Vogelsteller proposed the ERC-20 token standard to provide standardized specifications for the issuance and exchange of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain [
3
]. In 2017, Abdullah Albeyatti and technical expert Mo Tayeb designed the distributed medical data platform Medicalchain, which realized safe and efficient medical data management and drug traceability while protecting patient privacy [
4
]. In the same year, PowerLedger and Grid+ were proposed for energy trading and power market and grid management, providing consumers with transparent and efficient power market services [
5
]. In 2022, Goudarzi et al. analyzed and discussed the application of Internet of Things technology in smart grids, pointing out that in the future, blockchain technology needs to be used to solve the challenges faced by smart grids in terms of data privacy protection, energy transaction security, and energy consumption management [
6
]. In the same year, Waseem et al. proposed a blockchain-based smart grid architecture to achieve decentralized, credible, and secure energy management; however, this architecture has limitations in terms of big data performance and supervision [
7
]. Aiming at the IoT security issues under the high concurrent traffic of large-scale IoT devices, in 2021, Kumar et al. proposed a distributed architecture of multiple fog node collaboration to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks in smart contracts, blockchains, and IoT systems; however, the proposed architecture requires considerable computing resources [
8
]. In 2022, Zhou et al. analyzed the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts and used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify contracts [
9
]. In the same year, Gupta et al. proposed a smart contract feature extraction method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with the random forest algorithm to classify contracts to detect malicious smart contracts in the Internet of Things environment [
10
]. Recent research has initially explored the combined application of the blockchain and the Internet of Things, but challenges remain in terms of performance and security that need to be further studied and developed.
Compared with traditional applications, blockchain-based smart contracts have several significant differences. First of all, the contract code is relatively small in size and simple in logic and can be implemented through simple if…else…statements. When the conditions are met, the contract is executed automatically without human intervention. Second, once the contract is deployed on the chain, the contract and the data it generates cannot be modified again. Therefore, if a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain in the presence of vulnerabilities, it may cause huge economic losses. For example, in 2016, the DAO lost ETH 3.6 million due to a re-entrancy vulnerability, resulting in a loss of USD 70 million [
11
]. In 2018, the BEC campaign lost more than USD 900 million due to integer overflow vulnerabilities [
12
].
To avoid the abovementioned security crises caused by smart contract vulnerabilities, researchers have proposed various detection methods for smart contracts based on existing code vulnerability detection technologies, such as symbolic execution, fuzzy testing, and formal verification, to detect known vulnerabilities [
13
,
14
,
15
]. With the rapid increase in the number of smart contracts, traditional vulnerability detection techniques can no longer meet the audit needs of a large number of smart contracts in a short period of time. Therefore, deep learning technology has gradually become a more effective means of smart contract vulnerability detection. Deep learning technology trains models by extracting features from large-scale data, and its feature representation ability has an important impact on the accuracy of vulnerability detection [
16
]. At present, most researchers use multimodel parallel or serial feature extraction to capture the most representative key features, but no scholars have optimized the feature learning ability of deep learning models from the perspective of vector space representation. In addition, existing deep learning schemes usually use the bytecode of smart contracts as input data, which is not conducive to developers' code writing and debugging. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more source-code-based deep learning solutions to improve the efficiency and accuracy of vulnerability detection.
To address the abovementioned issues, we propose a vulnerability detection scheme for Ethereum smart contracts based on metric learning triplet loss and bidirectional a long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network model. Our main contributions are as follows:
(1)
A novel vulnerability detection scheme is proposed from the perspective of feature representation space optimization. In contrast to existing methods that improve the feature learning ability by combining multiple models, we optimize and evaluate the features extracted by the model based on metric learning, making smart contracts of the same category more cohesive and smart contracts of different categories more discrete, improving the accuracy of vulnerability detection.
(2)
The proposed model enhances the interpretability of contract vulnerability detection. Our approach involves using the source code of Ethereum smart contracts as input data, which is then subjected to word vectorization and an attention mechanism. This process allows us to identify the critical features associated with vulnerabilities, aiding in pinpointing the root cause of the issue.
(3)
We construct a large-scale dataset of smart contracts. We collected 165,000 verified source codes of smart contracts and used a variety of vulnerability detection tools to assign vulnerability labels to provide more comprehensive data support for detection.
(4)
The proposed model improves detection accuracy. Experiments prove that compared with traditional methods and other deep learning models, the proposed scheme can better extract vectorized features of smart contracts and effectively improve the accuracy of vulnerability detection.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2
 introduces important and common types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts and related research on existing smart contract vulnerability detection techniques. 
Section 3
 details the framework of our smart contract vulnerability detection scheme based on triplet loss and the bidirectional long short-term memory network model. 
Section 4
 presents the experimental procedure of this scheme and a performance comparison with other schemes. 
Section 5
 summarizes the work reported in this paper and elaborates on the direction of further research in the future.
To accurately detect the vulnerabilities in smart contracts, we conducted an in-depth study on the common vulnerabilities in current contracts and existing smart contract vulnerability detection technologies.
Once a smart contract is deployed on the chain, the operations generated when an unsafe contract is attacked cannot be reversed. There are many possible reasons for contract insecurity, including functional limitations caused by the inherent properties of the blockchain platform, logic errors caused by developers' negligence in the coding process, and the order of contract business processes [
17
]. We modeled and analyzed the following four typical vulnerability types based on the datasets we collected.
Arithmetic vulnerabilities:
 Arithmetic vulnerabilities in smart contracts mainly involve integer overflow and underflow issues. These problems usually occur during integer operations in contracts, which may lead to unexpected results and potential security issues [
18
]. Integer overflow means that when an integer variable increases beyond its maximum allowed value, it restarts calculations from the minimum value. For example, in Solidity, the maximum value allowed for an integer of type uint256 is 




2


256




− 1. When this integer variable is incremented by 1, it becomes 0, as shown in 
Figure 1
. Correspondingly, integer underflow means that when an integer variable decreases below its allowed minimum value, it restarts calculations from the maximum value. For example, in Solidity, the minimum value allowed for an integer of type uint256 is 0. When that integer variable is decremented by 1, it becomes 




2


256




− 1, which is integer underflow. Arithmetic bugs can lead to lost funds, incorrect transfers, and other security issues.
In the contribute function in line 7 of the crowdfunding contract example presented in 
Figure 1
, both 
balances[msg.sender]
 and 
totalRaised
 may have integer overflow vulnerabilities.
Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities:
 Re-entrancy vulnerabilities are caused by a contract calling an external contract before completing a state update [
19
]. In this case, the called external contract may call the original contract again, causing the state of the original contract to be changed unexpectedly.
The 
withdraw()
 function in 
Figure 2
 uses the low-level call function on line 12 to send ETH back to the user before updating the balance on line 14. However, transferring funds before updating user balances leaves room for re-entrancy attacks. An attacker can create a malicious contract, as shown in 
Figure 3
, which calls the 
withdraw()
 function again when receiving ETH, resulting in repeated payments.
In this malicious contract, the 
attack()
 function on line 10 first deposits to VulnerableBank, then calls the 
withdraw()
 function. When ETH is sent to the malicious contract, its 
receive()
 function is triggered, and the 
withdraw()
 function is called again, causing the original contract to pay multiple times.
Unchecked calls:
 Unchecked calls are mainly caused by contract developers not correctly checking the call results when calling other contracts or sending ETH [
20
]. When the call fails, it may cause unexpected behavior or other security issues in the contract. In Ethereum's Solidity smart contract, contracts can call each other through low-level functions such as call, delegatecall, and send. However, these low-level functions do not automatically throw exceptions but instead return a Boolean indicating whether the call was successful or not. If the developer fails to check the return value when calling these functions, it may lead to an unchecked call vulnerability.
In 
Figure 4
, the 
transfer
 function sends ETH to the target address via the 
call.value
 function. However, it does not check the result of the call, which could cause other problems in the contract if the call fails.
Inconsistent access control:
 Inconsistent access control is mainly due to the negligence or inexperience of contract developers in designing and implementing access control strategies, resulting in improper smart contract permission control, which may allow unauthorized users to access or modify sensitive information and functions of the contract [
21
]. Access control issues can lead to security risks such as loss of funds, contract tampering, data leakage, etc.
The 
withdrawAllFunds()
 function on line 20 in 
Figure 5
 does not implement the access control policy correctly, and anyone can withdraw all funds after the contract is unlocked. This could allow unauthorized users to perform sensitive operations and result in loss of funds. To fix this, we need to add a check on the 
msg.sender
 function to make sure only the owner can do this.
Existing smart contract vulnerability detection methods can be roughly divided into two types: those based on traditional technologies, such as symbolic execution, fuzz testing, and formal verification, and vulnerability detection schemes based on deep learning technology.
Researchers have proposed a variety of vulnerability detection tools based on traditional methods to date. For example, Manticore is based on symbolic execution and taint analysis techniques, which accept contract source code or bytecode as input to detect integer overflow vulnerabilities [
22
]. The Oyente tool is also based on symbolic execution technology. It can detect vulnerabilities such as transaction sequence dependency, timestamp dependency, and re-entrancy. However, it has a high false-positive rate for integer overflow vulnerabilities [
23
]. Mythril, which is also based on symbolic execution technology, performs grammatical analysis on the smart contract code to determine the code structure and semantics, thereby building an abstract model. This model simulates the running state of the contract and performs checks on the model to identify possible security issues [
24
]. ContractFuzzer is based on fuzz testing technology, which can quickly generate a large amount of random data to test smart contracts to detect contract vulnerabilities quickly and effectively [
25
]. Solhint is based on formal verification technology. By performing lexical analysis and syntax analysis on the contract code and using predefined vulnerability rules and checkpoints to match the code, it can help developers identify code problems in the early stage of development [
26
]. Generally speaking, vulnerability detection technology based on traditional methods has the following bottlenecks:

This has caused concern among investors and traders in the Ethereum market.


However, experts and analysts believe the recent disclosure of the Hinman documents on June 13th could mark a relief wave for Ethereum's price. 


The Hinman documents refer to a series of emails and memos from the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, recently released to the public.


The Hinman documents include a series of emails and memos from the former director of the SEC, who declared in 2018 that Ethereum's native token, Ether, is not a security. 
 
Ethereum Traders Should Keep An Eye On The XRP Case


Recently, the release of emails from former SEC official William Hinman regarding Ethereum has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community. While some have claimed that the documents are a smoking gun for the cryptocurrency, others have downplayed their significance. 


However, analyst Adam Cochran has 
argued 
that the documents are a nuance that puts current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in a corner. 


The Hinman speech attempted to clarify the SEC's position on digital assets, such as ETH and XRP, and their relation to security regulations. In his speech, Hinman went beyond the scope of the Howey test and attempted to understand the nuanced intent of users vs. investors. He also questioned the concept of morphing, or whether something can be a security and then later not a security.


The feedback comment from SEC staff specifically noted to him that they wanted to pivot to the discussion of 'what is a security' rather than the idea of morphing. And that their concerns came from implication differences between the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.


Hinman specifically drew attention to the idea that 'promoters' have a very specific legal analysis point – and that even a coordinated group of actors working on something wouldn't rise to the level of being deemed the promoter if their efforts weren't essential.


The draft on Ethereum, which came after meeting with Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, and his lawyers, noted that Ethereum was not at such time a security and that secondary sales didn't raise Securities Act concerns – only Exchange Act and Commodities Act concerns. 


According to Cochran, that footnote is of incredible importance as it notes that the SEC internally viewed secondary sales not as sales of the promoter at the time. 


Furthermore, Cochran believes the documents are damning for Gensler's position because they acknowledge the idea of ‘reverse-morphing' of an asset becoming a security. Suppose the SEC wanted to argue that Ethereum is a security today. In that case, they must acknowledge the idea of ‘morphing', prove the burden of a promoter being liable for all secondary sales of an asset ever, and break every precedent of horizontal and vertical commonality.


Cochran further claimed: 


For Gary to conclude that proof-of-stake Ethereum is a security, he would both need to fight a landslide of precedent on the most litigated part of Howey analysis – and admit to the idea that securities status can change over time with decentralization.
 
Overall, many market analysts believe that disclosing the Hinman documents could boost Ethereum's price in the short term. This is because it removes some of the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and could increase investor confidence in the cryptocurrency.

In this paper, we present subgraphs of Ethereum wallets involved in NFT trades of the top 15 ERC721 NFT collections. To obtain the subgraphs, we have extracted the Ethereum transaction graph from a live Ethereum node and filtered out exchanges, mining pools, and smart contracts. For each of the selected collections, we identified the set of accounts involved in NFT trading, which we used to perform a breadth-first search in the Ethereum transaction graph to obtain a subgraph. These subgraphs can offer insight into the linkability of accounts participating in NFT trading on the Ethereum blockchain.

Grayscale Investments®
, the world's largest digital currency asset manager, and manager of Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund (
OTCQX: GDLC
) (Digital Large Cap Fund), Grayscale® DeFi Fund (
OTCQB: DEFG
) (DeFi Fund), and Grayscale® Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund (GSCPxE Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for each product in connection with their respective second quarter 2023 reviews.
 
No new tokens were added or removed from the Digital Large Cap Fund. At the end of the day on July 6, 2023, the Digital Large Cap Fund's Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.*
 
Bitcoin (BTC), 70.05%
Ethereum (ETH), 27.02%
Cardano (ADA), 1.19%
Solana (SOL), 0.99%
Polygon (MATIC), 0.75%
 
In accordance with the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale has adjusted the DeFi Fund's portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings, and using the cash proceeds to purchase Lido (LDO). No tokens were removed from the DeFi Fund.
 
LDO is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the decentralized Lido protocol, which enables liquid use of staked tokens on proof-of-stake blockchain networks. Traditionally, tokens staked to support the security of a proof-of-stake blockchain network are locked while they accumulate staking rewards, and therefore are not buyable, sellable, transferable, or useable until those tokens are unstaked. The Lido protocol allows users to buy, sell, transfer, and use stTokens, which represent assets that have been staked to support the security of their respective proof-of-stake networks. To create an stToken, a user stakes a base-layer network's native token through the Lido protocol, receiving an stToken in return. For example, an Ethereum user that stakes an ETH token through Lido will receive an stETH in return. An stToken is typically mintable or redeemable for its underlying staked token on a one-to-one basis. Staking rewards related to the underlying staked tokens that accumulate to the Lido protocol are re-staked while existing stToken holders receive newly minted stTokens to ensure the holders' balances of the related stToken increase proportionately to maintain their stTokens' one-to-one representation with the underlying asset.
 
The Lido protocol is governed by the Lido decentralized autonomous organization, or Lido DAO. Lido DAO decides how to set the protocol's key parameters and to execute upgrades. Holders of LDO have the ability to use their tokens to vote on Lido DAO decisions. Lido was originally founded by Lido Finance, with its original description published in a white paper in 2020.
 
At the end of the day on July 6, 2023, the DeFi Fund's Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.*
 
Uniswap (UNI), 45.46%
Lido (LDO), 19.04%
Aave (AAVE), 11.53%
MakerDAO (MKR), 10.82%
Curve DAO Token (CRV), 7.03%
Synthetix (SNX), 6.12%
 
No new tokens were added or removed from the GSCPxE Fund. At the end of the day on July 6, 2023, the GSCPxE Fund's Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.*
 
Cardano (ADA), 25.89%
Solana (SOL), 21.58%
Polygon (MATIC), 16.38%
Polkadot (DOT), 16.28%
Avalanche (AVAX), 11.38%
Cosmos (ATOM), 8.49%
 
Neither the Digital Large Cap Fund, nor the DeFi Fund, nor GSCPxE Fund generate any income, and all regularly distribute Fund Components to pay for ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of Fund Components represented by shares of each fund gradually decreases over time.

Aave D,"The proposal to launch GHO on Ethereum's mainnet reached quorum after protocol delegate AaveChan voted'Yae' on Wednesday.

Aave DAO's community wholly backed the plan as all members of the DAO voted in support with over 698,000 votes at press time. This comes after months of successfully testing the GHO stablecoin on the Ethereum testnet Goerli and developers encountered no major bugs with the token.

Stablecoin GHO is set to debut on the Ethereum mainnet following Aave DAO's support of a plan to introduce the token via two facilitators. The proposal reached quorum after a key project delegate voted'Yae'.

Aave companies floated the proposal in the protocol's DAO on Tuesday, arguing that launching GHO on Ethereum would make stablecoin borrowing on the platform more competitive and increase revenue for the $5 billion DeFi lending titan.

The proposal plans to introduce GHO to Ethereum's mainnet via two facilitators. Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator will allow users to borrow GHO tokens against collateral deposited in V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool.

Users can also mint GHO without any collateral by using the FlashMinter Facilitator, provided that the loan is repaid in a single transaction after flash minting Aave's stablecoin. The proposal said this method could help to maintain GHO's peg and offer arbitrage opportunities for high-level users.

Although voting is still on at press time, over 698,000 votes in support of deploying GHO on Ethereum's mainnet suggest that the proposal would be approved by 14:21 UTC +01:00 on Friday when voting closes.

Proponents expect that GHO will then officially launch on Ethereum by July 15 after nearly six months of testing on Goerli by developers.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-07/12/eS_12d2bimage_story.png,False,@menafn,9.012776,c93e96320c6f01bfdd768224ae64a8a8

Dubai, United","Dubai, United Arab Emirates, July 11th, 2023, Chainwire

pikamoon, an emerging Ethereum blockchain game, has raised $3.6 million in its ongoing ICO to bring more value to the Ethereum ecosystem and revolutionise the blockchain gaming space. Pikamoon would launch the world's most immersive metaverse game and a first-of-its-kind earning model that allows players to withdraw their in-game rewards directly to their wallet or bank account without the need for a third party.

Pikamoon focuses on becoming the most realistic metaverse game where players can get a 360-degree experience of the growing virtual space through unparalleled gameplay, stunning visuals, and innovative DeFi features. Drawing inspiration from legendary games like Fortnite, Pokemon, and FIFA, the Ethereum game has leaped forward and is prepared to blend NFTs, video gaming, and metaverse entertainment perfectly.

The Pikamoon game is built on Unity, the world's most advanced game development technology, to create the stunning visuals and architecture needed to give players a truly immersive experience.

Additionally, Pikamoon is built across two blockchains: Ethereum and MultiversX (formerly Elrond). While Ethereum provides scalability, MultiversX complements it by providing efficiency and ensuring the game is environmentally friendly by reducing carbon emissions generated by transactions. This dual blockchain feature ensures that the Pikamoon ecosystem can cater to legions of gamers without any lag.

Gaming enthusiasts and smart investors are convinced Pikamoon is the future of gaming, and this is evident in how fast phase one and phase two of the ICO sold out. In the first phase, one PIKA sold for $0.0002, which increased to $0.0004 in the second phase, and now in the third and last phase, one PIKA is selling for $0.0006 and selling out faster.

Notable partners of this Ethereum-based game include future-thinking Web3 brands such as Ethereum, Transak, Cryptonews.com, Kevuru Games, and MultiversX. This line-up of industry leaders further reinforces the credibility of the project, reaffirming the fact that the team is committed to building the best of the best gaming projects.

Pikamoon offers investors the opportunity to enter what is strategically seen as a huge market of the Metaverse and gaming on the Ethereum blockchain. A core feature of the PIKA token is its deflationary nature. Whenever a sell or transfer transaction occurs in the Pikamoon ecosystem, 0.5% of the tokens involved in the transaction are burned forever, translating into more profits for long-term investors.

75,Ethereum Whales Capitalize On Price Surge,MENAFN,2023-07-16 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106611044/Ethereum-Whales-Capitalize-On-Price-Surge,menafn.com,"Recent data indicates that Ethereum (ETH) whales are selling their holdings rapidly. A whale sold 4,549 ETH for approximately $8.78 million for $1,9","Notably, on January 9, this whale spent $6 million to purchase 4,549 ETH at $1,319, resulting in a profit of approximately $2.78 million.

This sell-off pattern among ETH whales may have been prompted by a strategic move to capitalize on the recent price increase of the cryptocurrency .

This market situation is essentially the result of the favorable court ruling favoring Ripple's XRP, which had a domino effect on several other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.

The court's decision appears to have significantly boosted the sentiment of the cryptocurrency market as a whole, resulting in a substantial price increase for several tokens, including Ethereum.

Following the court's ruling on XRP, the price of Ethereum increased to around $2,000.

This remarkable rally unquestionably afforded ETH whales, who had acquired their holdings at a lower price level, a lucrative profit-taking opportunity.

Consequently, the current ETH sell-off by whales may reflect these large investors cashing in their profits, an understandable move given the notorious volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

However, as whales began selling, the price of Ethereum started to fall below $2,000, a natural market reaction to a significant sell-off.

76,Significant Fall In Ethereum Network Revenue: A Detailed Analysis Of Q2 2023 Trends,MENAFN,2023-07-20 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106639663/Significant-Fall-In-Ethereum-Network-Revenue-A-Detailed-Analysis-Of-Q2-2023-Trends,menafn.com,"Ethereum, a dominant force in decentralized finance (DeFi), faced an unexpected slump in network revenue during Q2 2023. According to a recent study","The year 2023 was marked by a dramatic downshift in Ethereum's network revenue, with the second quarter showcasing a significant drop. The net value descended from a robust $1.27 billion to a relatively lean $847 million. Such a decline in revenue signifies a substantial decrease in transaction fees remitted to Ethereum validators. That includes the associated fees that are subsequently incinerated.

A notable reason for this revenue decline could be the lean period that hit the DeFi market during Q2, significantly affecting Ethereum's revenue stream.

Simultaneously, the average daily active addresses on Ethereum's network fell by 6%. A parallel phenomenon was witnessed in Ethereum's inflation rate. The rate tumbled 213%, with an average shift from 0.71% to an alarming -0.8%, reflecting the growth in ETH supply.

Despite a challenging quarter, Ethereum retained its position as the unrivaled leader of defi . That demonstrates remarkable resilience amid an unpredictable year. Ethereum, with its innovative technology and robust network, has managed to stay afloat during these turbulent times, continuing to be a powerhouse in the DeFi domain.

Interestingly, Ethereum has surpassed an average monthly burn of 146,000 ETH, incurring a total of 3,472,331 ETH. That adds up to a whopping $6.5 billion, marking a significant milestone since the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.

Implemented with the London Hard Fork in August 2021, EIP-1559 is an integral mechanism responsible for Ethereum's transformation into a deflationary network. Most of these burns are primarily derived from ETH transfers, NFT transactions on leading platforms like OpenSea, and high-volume decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

During the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) held in Paris, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a revolutionary concept to simplify the use of crypto wallets . Buterin's proposal, known as modern account abstraction, is as user-friendly as an email ID, significantly boosting Ethereum's user accessibility.

This innovative approach could simplify wallet recovery, making it as straightforward as resetting an email account password. Although this feature might still be a considerable distance away from realization, it undoubtedly holds the potential to augment Ethereum's revenue, helping it regain its lost momentum in future quarters.

Uncover the risks and challenges posed by front-running and sandwich attacks. Delve into the mechanics of MEV extraction, including backrunning, frontrunning, priority gas auctions, and transaction censorship. Understanding Ethereum's Dark Forest and MEV is intricate. Utilizing resources like the automated trading bot, Ethereum Code , can simplify this journey.

Understanding Ethereum's Dark Forest

When we talk about the Dark Forest in Ethereum, we are referring to the realm where transactions take place before they are included in a block and added to the blockchain. It is a space where traders, investors, and developers engage in various activities, hoping to execute their transactions swiftly and efficiently.

Front-running occurs when an opportunist spots a pending transaction and intentionally executes a similar transaction with higher gas fees, pushing the original transaction further down the line. This can result in unfair advantages, particularly for those with insider knowledge or sophisticated tools. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, involve manipulating transaction ordering to exploit price discrepancies between different trades.

The Dark Forest is also a breeding ground for Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which further complicates the transaction landscape. MEV refers to the value that miners can extract from transactions by reordering, censoring, or including certain transactions in blocks. Miners have the power to influence the order of transactions and can prioritize those that yield the highest profits for themselves.

The Dark Forest of Ethereum is a dynamic and complex environment, riddled with challenges such as front-running and sandwich attacks. The presence of MEV adds another layer of complexity, as miners can extract additional value by manipulating transaction ordering. To fully grasp the implications of MEV, we must delve deeper into its mechanics and explore its impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.

The Basics of Miner Extractable Value (MEV)

To truly understand the intricacies of MEV, it is important to define what it represents in the Ethereum ecosystem. MEV refers to the additional value that miners can obtain by exploiting their position in the transaction ordering process. Miners have the authority to choose the sequence of transactions to include in a block, and this power enables them to extract value beyond the standard block rewards and transaction fees.

Historically, MEV extraction has evolved alongside the growth of Ethereum and its decentralized applications. Early instances of MEV extraction were limited, but as the ecosystem expanded, so did the opportunities for miners to maximize their gains. MEV can have a significant impact on Ethereum's scalability and transaction processing, as it introduces complexities and inefficiencies in the transaction ordering mechanism.

As Ethereum continues to thrive and attract more users, developers have started exploring strategies to maximize MEV extraction. These strategies involve identifying and exploiting profitable opportunities, such as arbitrage possibilities and flash loans. Through these techniques, miners can capture the value that arises from price discrepancies, liquidity imbalances, or other exploitable situations.

The Mechanics of MEV Extraction

MEV extraction encompasses various techniques that miners employ to extract additional value from transactions. One prominent method is backrunning and frontrunning transactions. Backrunning involves inserting a transaction between two existing transactions, while frontrunning entails prioritizing a transaction by including it before others in a block. By strategically manipulating the order of transactions, miners can take advantage of price movements and profit from their privileged position.

Additionally, miners can engage in priority gas auctions. When a user submits a transaction with a high gas fee, miners can intercept and replace that transaction with a higher gas fee, essentially auctioning off the priority to execute it. This practice allows miners to maximize their earnings by capitalizing on users' willingness to pay higher fees for expedited transaction processing.

MEV extraction also involves censorship of transactions. Miners have the ability to exclude or delay certain transactions from being included in a block, particularly those that may be disadvantageous to their profit-seeking motives. By censoring transactions, miners can potentially prevent competitors from taking advantage of lucrative opportunities or secure a higher chance of including their own transactions with MEV potential.

Sophisticated tools and platforms have emerged to facilitate MEV extraction. Some services specialize in monitoring and analyzing the mempool, where pending transactions reside, to identify profitable opportunities for miners. These tools provide insights into transaction sequencing and enable miners to optimize their strategies for extracting MEV. Furthermore, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become a focal point for MEV extraction, as miners can exploit the order execution process and prioritize their own transactions to enhance their profits.

Conclusion

While MEV extraction offers lucrative opportunities for miners, it raises concerns of fairness and trust within the ecosystem. Exploring these techniques underscores the need for mitigating MEV's negative impacts and fostering transparency and integrity. As Ethereum continues to evolve, addressing MEV becomes crucial for promoting a more equitable and efficient network.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-07/27/pr_15215_4abd67cf_image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,9.392487,1db6812c80b10dc66c23ce06ee74d169

An address holding assets stolen from JPEGd, another affected DeFi protocol, also returned funds amid recovery efforts from affected projects and white hat hackers. Meanwhile, founder Michael Egorov has sold 106 million CRV tokens in OTC deal to rebalance debts on DeFi lenders like Aave and Fraxlend.

The Alchemix/CurveFinance Exploiter returned nearly $9 million in funds drained from the DeFi protocol following on-chain negotiations spotted via Etherscan on Friday.

Alchemix Finance received a blockchain transaction note asking the protocol to confirm its wallet address. The exploiter then transferred 4,820 ether over three transactions to Alchemix's multi-sig wallet. At current prices, the assets are worth $8.9 million.

Friday's transaction represents a portion of around $61 million drained from decentralized exchange Curve Finance. The attacker reportedly exploited a code bug in Vyper's compiler, a smart contract programming language used by Curve across its platform.

The code bug allowed malicious attackers to drain liquidity pools affecting Metronome, Alchemix, and JPEGd. So far, exploiters have returned some of the looted assets to Alchemix and JPEGd.

Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return. CRV gained 5% in price on Friday following news of Alchemix's recovery.

CRV, Curve native token and a cryptocurrency widely used across Ethereum's DeFi lending ecosystem dipped in price following exploits on the exchange's in-house pools.

The drop in CRV's price spelled danger for loans taken by founder Michael Egorov. Egorov deposited million of CRV tokens as collateral on DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Fraxlend. These loans risked liquidation if CRV's price fell below $0.30.

In response to the CRV's declining price amid last weekend's exploit, Egorov spurred a deluge of over-the-counter (OTC) deals with some 13 investors including Tron founder Justin Sun.

Egorov's CRV sales from OTC trades total 106 million CRV tokens and he received $42 million USDT in return. This liquidity has seemingly gone into balancing debts on aave and other lenders amid concerns of a DeFi implosion.

Using the capital asset pricing model, this article critically assesses the relative importance of computing ‘realized' betas from high-frequency returns for Bitcoin and Ethereum—the two major cryptocurrencies—against their classic counterparts using the 1-day and 5-day return-based betas. The sample includes intraday data from 15 May 2018 until 17 January 2023. The microstructure noise is present until 4 min in the BTC and ETH high-frequency data. Therefore, we opt for a conservative choice with a 60 min sampling frequency. Considering 250 trading days as a rolling-window size, we obtain rolling betas < 1 for Bitcoin and Ethereum with respect to the CRIX market index, which could enhance portfolio diversification (at the expense of maximizing returns). We flag the minimal tracking errors at the hourly and daily frequencies. The dispersion of rolling betas is higher for the weekly frequency and is concentrated towards values of 


β


 > 0.8 for BTC (


β


 > 0.65 for ETH). The weekly frequency is thus revealed as being less precise for capturing the ‘pure' systematic risk for Bitcoin and Ethereum. For Ethereum in particular, the availability of high-frequency data tends to produce, on average, a more reliable inference. In the age of financial data feed immediacy, our results strongly suggest to pension fund managers, hedge fund traders, and investment bankers to include ‘realized' versions of CAPM betas in their dashboard of indicators for portfolio risk estimation. Sensitivity analyses cover jump detection in BTC/ETH high-frequency data (up to 25%). We also include several jump-robust estimators of realized volatility, where realized quadpower volatility prevails.

The tumultuous evolution of its market value exemplifies a general trend in cryptocurrency: Bitcoin has the highest financial valuation. Its price has risen sharply in recent years, mainly due to quantitative easing measures adopted by major central banks to address the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.

This paper seeks to exploit a multiplicative decomposition of the CAPM beta into hourly, daily, and weekly frequencies as a direct extension of previous works by 
Cenesizoglu and Reeves
 (
2018
) and 
González et al.
 (
2018
) with an original application to the two most liquid and largest cryptos by market capitalization (i.e., Bitcoin and Ethereum). The sample includes intraday data from 15 May 2018 until 17 January 2023. This period allows us to explore for the first time the effect of the FTX exchange crash.

 We document that the microstructure noise for BTC/ETH is strongly autocorrelated up to 446 ticks. Visually, the decay occurs after four minutes, which makes our choice of a 60 min sampling frequency in our paper unlikely to be contaminated by the presence of microstructure noise for either BTC or ETH. In particular, the scientific interest of this article consists in tracking at the highest frequency available the ‘pure' CAPM systematic risk of Bitcoin and Ethereum within the methodological framework of 
Hansen et al.
 (
2014
)'s realized betas. We identify the realized GARCH as a very attractive model for capturing volatility persistence better than the GARCH framework and delivering superior predictive ability (especially at a shorter horizon). As robustness checks, we further document the level of risk of Bitcoin and Ethereum should portfolio managers use cryptocurrencies as a diversification tool.
The literature on realized betas was first introduced by 
Bollerslev and Zhang
 (
2003
). 
Andersen et al.
 (
2006
) analyze the dynamics in realized betas, vis-à-vis the dynamics in the underlying realized market variance and individual equity covariances with the market. They highlight the potential for using high-frequency intraday data to capture the continuous evolution in realized betas. 
Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard
 (
2004
) provide a new asymptotic distribution theory for the realized beta. Further works, such as 
Bandi and Russell
 (
2005
) and 
Patton and Verardo
 (
2012
), confirm that extracting information from high-frequency data is very beneficial in time-varying conditional CAPM, compared to the relatively ‘weak' volatility signal captured by closing returns. 
Hollstein et al.
 (
2020
) also document that high-frequency betas provide more accurate predictions of future betas than those based on daily data. 
Hansen et al.
 (
2014
) jointly modeled stock returns and realized measures of their volatility and coined this ‘realized GARCH' (RGARCH). This multivariate volatility model incorporates both GARCH effects and realized measures of variances and covariances. Such a model enables us to consider the price and return information available at intra-day frequency. As individual returns are constructed conditionally based on past and contemporary market variables, extracting the realized betas between the market and the single asset in a dynamic version of the CAPM becomes possible. Indeed, with the realized market variance and realized covariance between the market and the individual stocks in hand, it becomes possible to define and empirically construct the individual equity ‘realized' betas. 
Alexeev et al.
 (
2016
) explored the stability of systematic risk in portfolios of assets on the S&P 500 based on such a decomposition of time-varying betas using high-frequency data.
It is worth noting other attempts to utilize information from realized measures: the GARCH-X (
Engle 2002
) to explain the variation in the realized measures, the multiplicative error model (MEM, 
Engle and Gallo 2006
) to account for additional latent volatility processes for each realized measure, the HEAVY model (
Shephard and Sheppard 2010
) nested with multiple latent volatility processes, and the HYBRID model (
Chen et al. 2011
) to capture intra-daily periodic patterns. Last but not least, 
Brownlees and Gallo
 (
2010
) estimate a restricted MEM model that is closely related to the realized GARCH with the linear specification.
Given the recent advances in collecting information on financial markets (e.g., the potentially heavy burden on the servers to store tick-by-tick data), the exploitation of granular information in high-frequency data constitutes the strongest signal available of latent volatility (
Andersen et al. 2003
). As a consequence, the RGARCH model will be able to capture the dependency over the very short term, which should lead to improvements in the empirical fit (as measured by log-likelihood or information criteria) and also be relevant for forecasting. Applications of the realized GARCH include, to cite a few examples, 
Watanabe
 (
2012
)'s quantile forecasts of financial returns, 
Tian and Hamori
 (
2015
)'s modeling of interest rate volatility, 
Contino and Gerlach
 (
2017
)'s Bayesian tail-risk forecasting, and 
Bonato
 (
2019
)'s work on agricultural commodity markets. Another recent application can be found by 
Doan et al.
 (
2022
) for the DJIA and SPDR ETF.
According to 
Almeida and Gonçalves
 (
2022
)'s bibliometric study, cryptocurrencies do not exhibit adequate hedging ability for the stock market, given that the correlation between stock and cryptocurrency pairs turns out to be positive in most cases. 
Charfeddine et al.
 (
2020
) have also evaluated low levels of hedging effectiveness for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Regarding diversification properties, adding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to an equity portfolio offers diversification benefits for investors compared to a solo equity portfolio (
Matkovskyy et al. 2021
; 
Mensi et al. 2020
). To our knowledge, the diversification properties of Ethereum still need to be assessed in greater depth. During market turbulence, the safe-haven property from gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum is also inconclusive (
Będowska-Sójka and Kliber 2021
). All these considerations lead us to investigate the CAPM betas of Bitcoin and Ethereum with intraday data, which is supposed, in theory, to bring a better measurement of the financial transactions than daily data.
On financial markets, ‘risk' refers only to the possibility of an unwelcome outcome and is traditionally coined as ‘downside risk'. In insurance, ‘pure risks' are all downside (such as the burst of a financial crisis). However, their crucial characteristic is that they remain insurable, which means that investors can transfer the risk to a counterparty (at a cost). As the workhorse portfolio model, the CAPM hypothesizes that unsystematic risk has already been diversified and that the beta is the only remaining measure of systematic risk for a given asset. As an original contribution, this article aims at tracking the ‘pure' systematic risk of Bitcoin and Ethereum thanks to the availability of high-frequency tick data and the measurement of so-called ‘realized' betas. An optimal beta calibration appears to be crucial for asset managers to decide whether to hold or rebalance portfolios, and it can trigger several trading orders to unwind a position. In theory, higher-frequency information should yield more precise estimates (
Andersen 2000
; 
Bollerslev and Wright 2001
). Shorter intervals can also prove more valuable than daily data, particularly when investors need to rebalance their portfolio in the wake of crypto-market crashes such as the recent FTX exchange fallout.
To preview the gist of our results, we report rolling betas inferior to one (on average, 0.80 for Bitcoin and 0.65 for Ethereum) with respect to the CRIX market index, which could help reduce the volatility within this investment universe. Three-dimensional plots reveal a higher dispersion of rolling betas at the weekly frequency. The statistical computation of tracking errors confirms that the two most accurate frequencies are typically found at the hourly and daily levels. Although estimation accuracy varies across assets and timescales, we highlight for Ethereum, in particular, that the availability of high-frequency data tends to produce, on average, a more reliable inference. To ascertain the pivotal role of hedging in risk management (i.e., in the hedge fund or investment bank), we also calculate hedging ratios as proposed by 
Kroner and Sultan
 (
1993
), which seem cheaper overall for Ethereum than for Bitcoin. Last but not least, we compute optimal portfolio holdings and hedging effectiveness.
When dealing with cryptocurrencies, there is indeed high volatility that typically worsens the asset manager's performance. On average, a USD 1 long position in the CRIX can be hedged by going short USD 0.9 on BTC (USD 0.6 on ETH). Optimal weights of cryptocurrencies in the investor portfolio range from 60% to 120% for Bitcoin (−20% to 45% for ETH). Hedging effectiveness is measured by the variance decrease for any hedged portfolio (BTC or ETH) compared with the unhedged portfolio (CRIX). Such a hedging strategy suggests that the inclusion of BTC in the CRIX portfolio ensures, on average, 37% variance reduction. To minimize the risk while keeping the same expected returns, we find that",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Bilel Sanhaji,Chevallier,Julien Chevallier,Sanhaji",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/econometrics/econometrics-11-00019/article_deploy/html/images/econometrics-11-00019-g001-550.jpg?1691644097,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,9.265582,11f43ff5e1d074a257a25a2068af6a35

Despite the lack of blockchain systems being utilized in modern IoT environments, the prevalence of blockchain technology is increasing, due to its high level of security and accountability. The integration of blockchain technology and access control in a decentralized system for smart home networks is a promising solution to this issue. This paper compares the implementation of attribute-based access control (ABAC) with two popular blockchain platforms, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for a smart home internet of things (IoT) environment. We present a comprehensive summary of access-control and blockchain-access-control methods, to provide the necessary background for this study. Additionally, we present an original ABAC smart contract for Ethereum, and the modification of a pre-existing Hyperledger Fabric ABAC smart contract, for this comparison. Through the simulation of both implementations, the advantages and limitations will be considered, to determine which is better suited for a smart home IoT environment.

Technological advancements have allowed for the integration of the internet of things (IoT) with home and residential buildings, presenting an advanced method of increasing the usability, security, and quality of life of the user [
1
]. This is called a smart home network, which is a home equipped with various devices, such as lighting, heating, and monitoring systems that smartphones or computers on the network can control [
2
]. There are an abundance of advantages that a smart home system provides for the user; however, with all advances in technology, there are a concerns regarding balancing data security and the privacy of the user on the network [
2
].
To address these security concerns, a centralized structure can be used, but this comes with a risk of being vulnerable to cyberattacks. For this reason, access-control methods can prevent unauthorized users from accessing network resources and data. One simple technique for implementing access control [
3
,
4
] is to use a central authority, with a central server [
2
]. However, this approach also presents a major system vulnerability. The entire network is compromised if the central server fails due to natural factors or cyber-attacks [
1
,
5
].
A distributed access-control network is used to overcome the shortcomings of a more traditional centralized network. This replaces the single server with multiple nodes to carry out the access-control system [
2
,
6
]. This method is more capable of withstanding cyber-attacks, as well as preventing unauthorized users from gaining access to network resources. One system that can provide this distributed access-control network is the integration of blockchain technology. This technique has opened up a wide variety of possibilities for securing all types of networks, especially in a smart home environment.
Due to its decentralized modular architecture, blockchain technology is a system used for storing data that is far more challenging to hack or alter [
7
]. A blockchain is a linked data structure that sequentially combines blocks of data and information. The system records the blocks in an encrypted form, as a distributed ledger that cannot be changed or tampered with [
8
]. Smart contracts [
9
] are used as a part of the blockchain, and are unique addresses to which end users can address transactions. As a part of smart contracts, transactions that interact with assets are defined [
10
]. A blockchain uses a distributed networking system of machines that replicate and create a chain of data. This chain of data is considered a ledger, with each of these forming the basis of a block. Smart contracts allow users to interact with ledgers [
5
,
11
].
A blockchain is made up of different blocks, each containing transactional information. Multiple blocks can be connected to form a chain, hence the name blockchain. When these blocks are chained together, it makes it challenging to alter data on one specific block, increasing the security of the system [
5
]. Each block contains information from the previous block, reinforcing the integrity of the data and of the overall blockchain system [
12
]. Additionally, each block is propagated within the network, allowing each machine to view the chain and all of its data, allowing for multiple verifications to take place [
5
]. This further ensures the authenticity of data and the integrity of the blockchain. The most common example of a blockchain in use would be in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum [
5
].
Two of the most widely used open-sourced blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric [
13
]. They provide a secure method of implementing a decentralized network in a transparent and programmable way. For this reason, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric will be the main blockchain platforms discussed in this review paper [
14
].
Ethereum is a popular blockchain platform used to build public and private blockchain networks. Through an analysis of the performance of this platform, regarding the security response time and the accuracy of the overall system, Ethereum can be compared to other centralized networks [
15
]. Studies show that the proposed network architecture outperforms the traditional centralized architecture by having a better accuracy and lower response time [
16
]. Blockchain-based architecture allows for a minimization of the breaches in confidentiality and integrity, and authentication issues in the heterogeneous IoT and centralized gateways, that are present in many security systems. There are possible security issues with the Ethereum blockchain; however, they can be avoided through the consideration of these vulnerabilities during the development of a smart contract [
15
].
Hyperledger Fabric is a popular blockchain implementation tool that is hosted by the Linux Foundation [
5
]. It has a modular architecture that is beneficial for customizing private networks. For example, it supports the use of consensus, membership, and database blockchain layers [
2
,
17
,
18
], which allows for a wide range of possibilities, especially for access-control security techniques [
19
]. In fact, it is possible to build security measures based on member's attributes using Hyperledger Fabric, which is why it is a popular choice for attribute-based access control (ABAC) [
5
,
17
,
20
]. However, it is not possible to implement a flexible or changing ABAC mechanism, because the parameters and permissions must be predefined on the network [
18
,
21
].
Smart contracts allow an automated program to be deployed on a blockchain network, in the form of encoded logic [
5
]. Developers use basic languages, such as node.js and Java, instead of those like Solidity, to code smart contracts. As a result, developers do not waste time learning a new language, and can create, update, and query device information from the ledger, by submitting transactions to the smart contract [
22
]. Access control is achieved using smart contracts, especially on an Ethereum platform [
2
,
15
].
A blockchain typically adopts a peer-to-peer trading system when it comes to buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly with one another. This makes a blockchain a considerably more secure system compared to centralized networks. Centralized security structures render systems more vulnerable, because the integrity, certification, and availability are compromised. Security threats and vulnerabilities increase with the spread of an IoT system structure: data forgery, tampering access to unauthorized devices, and incorrect device controls. The decentralized structure of a blockchain uses digital ledgers to record transactions and store data across the peer-to-peer network.
This paper presents a comparative study of a decentralized access-control system [
23
] that employs ABAC and blockchain technology under smart home IoT environments [
24
]. This will be implemented using a physical Ethereum private network and a simulated smart contract. A Hyperledger Fabric network will also be simulated, to explore a novel comparison of the implementation of ABAC in these two popular platforms [
19
,
25
]. The study explores a previously unexplored research direction, by comparing ABAC implementation in Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. This offers original advancements in smart contract design and modification, to achieve effective access control in smart home IoT environments.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
Firstly, the work compares ABAC implementation in both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric platforms.
A comprehensive summary of access-control and blockchain-specific access-control methods.
Development of an original ABAC smart contract for the Ethereum platform, without the use of a pre-existing codebase or template.
Modification of the pre-existing Hyperledger Fabric ABAC smart contract, to be better suited for this comparison.
This section will present some relevant work in this field of study. The main contributions of the studies will be discussed, as well as their shortcomings, to display the importance of the work performed in this paper.
Data security and privacy in IoT devices connected in a smart home environment comprise one of the highest priorities of the system. These IoT devices alone are constantly being exposed to various attacks, and lack the features to defend themselves accordingly. For this reason, many works have been carried out to address this issue, proposing different access-control methods to ensure the security and privacy of devices connected to the network. In this section, some related works will be discussed, to introduce previous implementations of access-control methods, along with the blockchain platform used [
26
]. 
Table 1
 serves to summarize the findings of this section, by listing the access-control method presented by the authors, and the blockchain implementation platform used, as well as the advantages and limitations of the access-control method used in their work [
27
].
Kumar et al. [
6
] built a blockchain-based healthcare network that uses an enhanced Bell–LaPadula model to classify different peers and transactions on the network, with different security levels. This enhancement to the Bell–LaPadula model used discretionary access control (DAC) and mandatory access control (MAC) [
6
]. DAC manages the established MAC permissions, to provide more flexibility in changing the access-control policies at any time. This model was constructed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform, with 35 peers on the network. The goal was to reduce the scalability issues in the blockchain network, which was successfully accomplished. However, this system is complicated by the use of the MAC, DAC, and Bell–LaPadula models [
6
] to implement access control. Each of these models has its own limitations, which are mitigated through the integration of other models into the system. However, this makes the system complicated to implement and maintain.
In the system presented by Cruz et al. [
28
], a role-based access-control (RBAC) framework was built, using smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum blockchain platform [
29
]. All user–role identifications and assignments are contained in the smart contract, which is then deployed on the blockchain. The system provides a secure and efficient way to define the user–role assignments, and verify the user's role. Personalization and approval are automatically included in the system, as well [
28
]. However, due to the nature of RBAC, the role of each user must be predefined before the implementation of this type of access control [
30
]. In addition, this system is only useful in an organization or a company, where everyone's individual roles are clearly defined. Even then, it can be a challenge, and can still pose difficulties when roles undergo changes within the company or network.
In a work carried out by Qashlan et al. [
31
], they proposed the extension of their earlier work [
31
], in which they presented a lightweight Ethereum blockchain-based multi-tier edge-smart home architecture. Every home in the framework has its own blockchain miners, along with smart contracts being used to ensure the automated enforcement of rules and policies to regulate the IoT devices [
31
]. This enforcement on the framework uses the attribute-based control (ABAC) approach to enforce rules. The extension of this work proposed the incorporation of cloud servers to increase the storage and analysis of IoT smart home device data [
2
]. The shortcoming of this experiment was the lack of testing to find the balance between the accuracy and the privacy of the data being transferred. The increase in privacy added more noise, which threatened the readability and accuracy of the data [
31
]. Despite this, we believe that ABAC is considered the most suitable access-control model for IoT applications. The model allows for dynamic and fine-grained access control, based on attributes, such as the user identity, device type, location, and other contextual information. ABAC can handle complex, dynamic, and heterogenous environments, for which traditional access-control models may not suffice.

90,Ethereum Faces Price Concerns As Buterin Transfers 600 Eth,MENAFN,2023-08-21 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106906853/Ethereum-Faces-Price-Concerns-As-Buterin-Transfers-600-Eth,menafn.com,"On Monday, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, transmitted 600 ETH worth nearly $1 million to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.","The move comes after the ETH price dropped more than 10% during a recent crypto market selloff , and analysts and market experts now expect Ethereum to collapse dramatically if it breaches the key support level.

On August 21, an address associated with Vitalik Buterin transferred 600 ETH worth nearly $1 million to Coinbase, according to data from PeckShieldAlert.

Typically, when Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation transfer ETH, the price of eth decreases . While the reason for the recent transfer remains mysterious, some believe it was Vitalik Buterin's latest massive sale.

The Ethereum team is currently working on the Cancun upgrade, which will introduce account abstraction, increase scalability, and improve storage efficiency.

If the price of ETH declines below $1,550, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez anticipates a substantial price correction. He anticipates a 37%–45% correction and risks a price decline to $1000.

Ethereum is at a critical inflection point, as its chart structure is very fragile. a breach of the $1,600–$1,550 range will precipitate a precipitous decline in the price of ETH.

The monthly average of active Ethereum ($ETH) addresses is lower than the yearly average, indicating low on-chain activity. This is a typical sign of deteriorating network health and utilization.

eth/usd and btc/usd are approaching major support levels. what is the outlook and what are the key levels to watch?

bitcoin's fall below key converged support around 27300-27800 has confirmed that the bullish pressure from last year has faded. the support includes the lower edge of the ichimoku cloud on the daily charts and a rising channel since early 2023.

this follows a failed attempt to cross above the converged barrier at the april high of around 31000, coinciding with the 89-week moving average and the upper edge of the ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart. for more discussion, see'bitcoin & ethereum hold ground ahead of us cpi: btc/usd & eth/usd price setups ,' published august 10.

while the fall below 27300-27800 has disrupted the uptrend for now, it is not sufficient to suggest an end of the uptrend. only a break below the june low of 24750 would trigger a reassessment of the overall bullish bias.any break below 24750 would trigger a double top (the april and july highs), pointing to a deeper retracement toward the march low of 19550.

ethereum looks relatively weaker than bitcoin. that's because eth/usd created a lower high (relative to its own peak in april) compared with btc/usd which in july briefly surpassed its april high.

eth/usd dropped below an important converged support on the 200-day moving average and a rising trendline since the end of 2022, confirming that the multi-week upward pressure has dissipated. ethereum is now testing major support at the june low of 1620. any break below would raise the odds that the uptrend from the end of last year had ended, pointing to a broad trading range of 1300-2000 subsequently for eth/usd. the next support is the march low of 1370.

After weeks of listless trade and low turnover, volatility returned to the cryptocurrency market with a bang Thursday when the market slumped in minutes with little in the way of support seen to stem the fall. bitcoin went into freefall and hit a multi-month low of $25,166 before making a minor recovery, while Ethereum slumped to $1,543 from a daily high print of $1,807. The market is awash with reasons behind the sharp selloff. Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for bankruptcy protection in New York yesterday, highlighting ongoing fears in China's property market, while this week's hawkish fomc outtake sent longer-dated US bond yields back to multi-month and multi-year highs.

The daily chart shows that Bitcoin is in extremely oversold territory and is below all three moving averages. BTC/usd has recovered some of yesterday's damage but will need a period of consolidation before attempting to push any higher. Whether yesterday's $25,166 print marks a short-term low is difficult to qualify after the latest burst of volatility.

The ETH/USD chart is very similar to the BTC/USD chart – heavily oversold but negative while still below all three simple moving averages.

Looking ahead, continued volatility remains likely with news expected shortly over whether the SEC will approve the first Ethereum futures-based ETF. Any news, positive or negative, from the SEC, will further stoke short-term volatility in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The SEC is also under the spotlight after Grayscale took the regulators to court last June over the SEC's refusal to allow the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to change into a cash Bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades at a heavy discount to the Bitcoin they hold and the company is looking to close this gap. A ruling is imminent and again is likely to shift the market.

Next week sees the yearly central banker annual meet up at Jackson Hole Symposium. The three-day event titled 'Structural Shifts in the Global Economy' features a raft of central bank heads and policymakers, and Fed chair Jerome Powell is expected to make a keynote speech. The latest FOMC minutes had a distinctly hawkish overtone and chair Powell may use next week's platform to reiterate the Fed's fight against inflation is not close to being over.

crypto staking is earning rewards by pledging tokens to support the blockchain's operation. before the blockchain transitioned to a proof-of-stake (pos) network, ethereum began offering eth staking in december 2020.

nonetheless, the sec considers certain stake-related products to be unregistered securities.

the bitstamp us ceo, bobby zagotta, stated that consumers will continue to receive staking rewards until september 25, 2023.

after this date, all staked assets will be unstacked, and rewards and principal will be added to users' primary bitstamp accounts.

this procedure typically takes a few days, though it may be extended based on network conditions.

the company is discontinuing its staking features due to u.s. regulations. according to zagotta, bitstamp is a highly regulated and trustworthy exchange.

they have a system in place to regularly review the services they provide and contemplate changing regulations in all their locations of operation.

'given the present regulatory environment in the united states, we've decided to discontinue staking for american customers,' zagotta explained.

in multiple instances, the securities and exchange commission of the united states has taken legal action against staking service providers.

according to the howey test, staking programs can be deemed investment contracts in lawsuits against coinbase and binance.

in june, the agency filed a lawsuit against coinbase global inc., alleging that its provision of staking services violated its regulations.

previously, kraken ceased staking offerings in the united states after announcing a $30 million settlement with the sec to resolve comparable allegations.

The current state of Ethereum (ETH) is causing traders to become increasingly impatient, a pattern historically associated with potential price rebounds.

This trend is attributable to observed wallet sales at lower price levels, which historically have increased the probability of a price rebound.

Whale Alert, a platform that monitors significant cryptocurrency transactions, has reported the transfer of 55,050 ETH worth approximately $93.7 million from an unidentified wallet to Binance . This noteworthy movement of Ethereum adds an intriguing dimension to the prevalent sentiment.

Ethereum is currently trading at $1,705.03, a decrease of 0.08% from its previprice. The market capitalization of the cryptocurrency has reached $205.02 billion at present. Notably, Ethereum's allure extends beyond trading as it continues to attract institutional investments.

Notably, OnlyFans, a company with a reputation for innovation, has recently invested in Ethereum, reinforcing its staas an attractive investment option.

Ethereum's transaction ecosystem is enduring changes as its price trajectory attracts attention. Ethereum's gas fees, also known as'gas fees,' reached a yearly peak in May as a result of a surge in meme-coin mania.

Since then, however, these fees have decreased significantly, provoking analyst discussion. The availability of layer 2 solutions, which improve Ethereum's scalability, is thought to be a potential cause of the decline in fees.

While the staking narrative strengthen,"As centralized exchanges witness a decline in Ethereum holdings, there's a conspicusurge toward self-custody and staking. It represents a transformative trend in how Ethereum's asset dynamics are evolving.

These charts revealed a staggering 28 million ETH staked, overshadowing the dwindling exchange balance of 14.7 million ETH. Davis's assertion,'Almost twice as much ETH being staked verETH available for sale on exchanges ,' underscores the significance of this shift.

Although some discrepancies exist in the reported figures, the overarching trend is unmistakable. Glassnode's data traces a 50% reduction in ETH held on exchanges since mid-2020.

Ultrasound.Money, another analytics portal, clocks in 24.3 million ETH staked, or over 20% of the total Ethereum supply. This amounts to a staggering $40 billion valuation despite the bear market conditions.

Conversely, Nansen paints a brighter picture with 26.1 million ETH staked, marking a historic peak. Significantly, the current dynamics show staking deposits surpassing withdrawals, ensuring sustained highs.

Liquid staking giant, Lido, stands out in this race, staking a colossal third of the total. At prevailing market prices, Lido's stake of 8.3 million ETH is valued at approximately $14 billion. On the other hand, Rocket Pool has secured a niche, with close to 800,000 ETH, or 3% of the total stake.

Coinbase, a leading centralized exchange, is the prominent Ethereum staking provider, staking 9% or 2.37 million ETH. In contrast, Binance, known for its competitive commissions, has staked 1.2 million ETH, representing 4.6% of the total.

The heightened interest in Ethereum staking is indicative of a changing tide. As more Ethereum moves away from centralized platforms, its ecosystem promises a decentralized , self-custodial future. However, the question remains: When will the asset prices catch up with this bullish trend? Only time will tell.

A channel between Ethereum and WEMIX mega ecosystems
Starting as a game-centric chain, it will expand to include DeFi, NFT, and more
Users and dApps will be rewarded with zero-start distribution token KRO
 
Kroma uses optimistic rollup with ZK fault proof, which is a new technology that combines optimistic rollup, currently widely used, and ZK proof. ZK rollup, while technically more challenging, can achieve a block finality faster than optimistic rollup. Lightscale plans to upgrade Kroma to 100% ZK rollup.
 
Kroma will start minting its native token KRO mid-2024. Its Tokenomics includes mechanisms for zero-start distribution with no pre-minting or pre-mining. A new block is generated every two seconds, and a KRO is minted and distributed to users and dApps as rewards. As their level of participation is determined by the number of their transactions, dApps and users that generated more transactions will receive more tokens. This reward system will induce active ecosystem expansion activities, thus creating a virtuous circle.
 
25% of KRO will be distributed to the WEMIX Foundation and WEMIX community, contributing to the WEMIX ecosystem.
 
Kroma will start as a chain for game-onboarding, and Night Crows will be serviced on the chain. The global blockchain version of the smash hit MMORPG, published by Wemade, is slated to be released this December. Lightscale aims to expand its ecosystem to include everything web3, such as DeFi and NFT. Part of Kroma's Ecosystem Fund will be granted to onboarding dApps to encourage joining its ecosystem.

The increased activity resulting from this widespread adoption frequently increases the value of the asset. ETH is currently trading at $1,639.36, an increase of 0.36% in the last 24 hours.

Ark Invest and 21Shares were listed as sub-advisors for a joint Ethereum ETF product in a recent SEC filing on August 24. The filing emphasized that Ethereum's future value is contingent on its extensive adoption and that any changes in this regard could have a substantial effect on its price.

The recent emergence of the possibility that the SEC may sanction the introduction of ether ETFs as early as October has added to the frenzy.

The SEC is inclined toward approving the first exchange-traded funds based on Ether futures , according to a recent Bloomberg report that further fueled optimism. Numerbusinesses that have long sought the opportunity to provide these products view this prospective action as a significant victory.

Notably, nearly a dozen companies are awaiting SEC approval, including Volatility Shares Trust, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.

This investment fund, known as the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, is the first filing of futures on Ethereum under the '33 Act and is managed and supervised by Toroso Investments.

Toroso Investments is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity pool operator and is also a member of the National Futures Association.

Significant emphasis has been placed on whether the proposed cryptocurrency ETFs will hold futures contracts or spot assets in light of the recent influx of ETF applications. While the SEC has authorized the former, it has not approved the latter.

Fund managers appear to be evaluating the viability of a middle-ground option in this regulatory environment. Hashdex's primary investment objective is to ensure that its shares track the daily fluctuations of the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price.

To accomplish this goal, the fund intends to invest in ether, CME-traded ether futures contracts, currency, and cash equivalents. The Fund intends to reduce its reliance on the spot market and resolve concerns about potential manipulation in unregulated ether spot exchanges by holding ether futures contracts and cash, according to Nasdaq's 19b-4 form:

Hashdex entered the race for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the United States. Hashdex's strategy differs from recent filings in that it will not rely on the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement and will instead acquire Bitcoin spot from tangible exchanges within the CME market.

In the previweek, Ark Invest and 21Shares both submitted SEC applications for spot ether ETFs, a type of ETF that VanEck is also pursuing.

The malicilink prompted many of his 4.9 million followers to connect their wallets to mint the NFT, but in reality, it simply created a vacuum for the hacker to steal their money.

While users were quick to raise the alarm about the fake link, Buterin's father (Dmitriy ""Dima"" Buterin) was the first to confirm that his son's account had been compromised.

""Disregard this post, apparently Vitalik has been hacked. He is working on restoring access,"" he posted on X.

Moreover, the report said that the post has since been removed, but several victims have reported losing access to funds in their wallets. The hacker appeared to have made off with more than $147,000 within an hour, but that quickly increased to $691,000, according to blockchain investigator @ZachXBT.

Since the hack was first reported, Buterin has not yet commented publicly on the incident.

As per @ZachXPT, the hacker subsequently sent a stolen NFT to Buterin, the report mentioned.

However, it is unknown how many users were affected by this incident.

In June, the X account of OpenAI's Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati was hacked in order to promote a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme.

Later, her account started promoting a new cryptocurrency called ""$OPENAI"" that was allegedly ""driven by artificial intelligence-based language models"".

In the unauthorised tweets, Murati's followers were encouraged to send money to an Ethereum digital wallet address in order to receive free ""airdropped"" coins.

The tweets were quickly deleted before reappearing minutes later with slightly altered wording.

Service providers provide customized network design and other related services, such as long-term maintenance contracts of installations, to cater to clients with specific requirements. They also provide remote support services for networks and can solve or manage network problems remotely. Companies such as Siemens AG (Germany) and General Electric (US) provide a separate services portfolio for this market.

POWERLINK to grow with a significant CAGR during the forecast period.

EthePOWERLINK is a real-time protocol for standard Ethernet. POWERLINK was initially developed by B&R (Austria). EthePOWERLINK is implemented on top of IEEE 802.3 and, therefore, allows a free selection of network topology and to cross-connect between different topologies. It uses a polling and time-slicing mechanism for real-time data exchange.

A POWERLINK master or managed node controls the time synchronization through packet jitter in the range of tens of nanoseconds. Such a system is suitable for all kinds of automation systems ranging from PLC-to-PLC communication and visualization down to motion and I/O control. Barriers to implementing POWERLINK are quite low due to the availability of open-source stack software. In addition, CANopen is part of the standard that allows for easy system upgrades from previFieldprotocols.

112,This Binance Wallet Triggered A Temporary 30X Surge In Ethereum Gas Fees,Opeyemi Sule,2023-09-22 00:00:49,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/this-binance-wallet-triggered-a-temporary-30x-surge-in-ethereum-gas-fees/,newsbtc.com,"A crypto wallet associated with Binance has seen massive activity in the last 24 hours, leading to abnormally high gas fee on Ethereum.","A cryptocurrency wallet associated with the prominent trading platform, Binance, has seen massive activity in the last 24 hours, leading to abnormally high transaction fees on the Ethereum network.


Binance Wallet Incurs Nearly $850,000 Gas Fees In One Day


A crypto wallet labeled 'Binance 14' witnessed a significant transaction surge on September 21, rising above 140,000. 
As a result of this activity surge, transactions of the Binance-owned wallet consistently incurred gas fees of over 300 gwei, even though the network's average fee was around 10 gwei.


This gas fee jump and significant wallet activity 
have resulted in around 530 ETH
 (equivalent to nearly $850,000) in gas used on the Binance 14 address today. 
 
The increase in transactions on the Binance wallet had a broader, albeit temporary, impact on the Ethereum network. Gas fees on the blockchain momentarily jumped from less than 10 gwei to above 330 gwei per transaction, according to blockchain data tracker 
Etherscan
.


Gas fees refer to the cost blockchain users incur or pay validators to conduct transactions or execute contracts on the Ethereum network. Fees depend on the blockchain's demand and supply of processing power. This means when a network has many transactions, there is often a high demand for processing power, which increases gas fees.


Possible Reasons For The Gas Fee Spike


In the wake of this incident, Wu Blockchain reported that Binance said it was carrying out its wallet aggregation process when the gas fees were low to facilitate withdrawals and ensure the safety of user funds. Nonetheless, some prominent crypto community members have weighed in on the situation, offering possible explanations for the gas fee spike. 


Martin Koppelmann, cofounder of the Gnosis chain, 
said on the X
 (formerly Twitter) platform that Binance might be using a 'really inefficient script' to consolidate, leading to high transaction costs.




Gas prizes spiking because of a ton of regular ETH transfers related to Binance.a) they are using a really inefficient script to consolidate funds and are massively overpaying transaction costs
b) something fishy is going on


— Martin Köppelmann 🦉💳 (@koeppelmann) 
September 21, 2023
 
Blockchain analysts at Scopescan 
gave a similar prognosis
 on the gas incident. The on-chain analytics platform said:


Due to Binance consolidating funds from long-inactive deposit addresses, the Ethereum network is experiencing congestion, causing Gas fees to surge to 300 gwei.
 
Adam Cochran, a popular crypto investor, suggested that the abnormally high transaction fees might have been due to Binance's subpar APIs. In 
his X post
, Cochran criticized the exchange's technological infrastructure while casting doubts on its capacity to safe-keep 'hundreds of billions in coins across multiple protocols.'


According to 
CoinGecko data
, the price of Ethereum currently sits below $1,600, reflecting a 2.8% decline in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, Ether maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $190 billion.

Injective
, the blockchain built for finance, today announced the launch of inEVM, the first-ever Ethereum Virtual Machine capable of achieving true composability across Cosmos and Solana. The inEVM network was developed in collaboration with Caldera, a L2 rollup infrastructure platform backed by Sequoia. 
 
With inEVM, Ethereum developers gain unprecedented access to Injective's global network and user base, offering a new realm of opportunities to expand the reach of their protocols. 
 
inEVM is part of Injective's larger plan to introduce a network of Electro Chains. In essence, this consists of a series of rollups with dedicated VM environments that would cater to the needs of distinct builders while still providing the highest levels of scalability and security. Electro Chains inherit security from Injective while also extending block space available on any one chain which directly contributes to a far more scalable network than what exists in Web3 today.
 
inEVM touts several major benefits for developers including ultra-fast speeds due to a parallelized structure, instant transaction finality, a modular toolkit, shared liquidity, and composability across the Cosmos IBC universe alongside Solana.
 
This latest development follows the recent release of Injective's inSVM (formerly known as ""
Cascade
""), the first Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) rollup solution integrated into the larger Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) ecosystem. This innovation has empowered Solana developers to effortlessly migrate their applications to Injective, extending their reach to a broader audience without the need for significant code modifications.
 
dApps launched on the inEVM layer would be able to compose directly with Cosmos and Solana applications due to Injective's Electro Chain initiative. As a result, both inter and intra VM interoperability would be achieved by builders on the inEVM layer. This in turn results in a far more seamless development experience devoid of traditional complexities and barriers.Injective has long been pioneering groundbreaking technology in Web3, and its latest creation, inEVM, is poised to redefine the way Ethereum developers interact with the broader blockchain universe. With inEVM, Ethereum developers can harness the power of solidity to seamlessly deploy their applications into the Injective ecosystem. 
 
Injective's overarching mission is to democratize the financial future by fostering decentralization across the blockchain landscape. The rise of Layer 1 solutions requires different networks to work together smoothly, and Injective's Electro Chains serve as the conduit that dynamically connects these networks. By enabling developers to swiftly launch their applications on multiple VM environments and simplifying user interaction with Web3, Injective is forging a cohesive, user-centric Web3 environment, where collaboration prevails over competition.
 
'inEVM will enable Ethereum developers to effortlessly deploy applications across Injective Electro Chains while also tapping into an expansive network of users and liquidity,' said Eric Chen, co-founder and CEO of Injective Labs. ""This marks a significant stride forward for Web3, as we work towards creating a fully integrated ecosystem, where developers and users can maximize the benefits of an optimized infrastructure stack without being hindered by barriers between networks.'
 
Injective's launch of inEVM underscores its dedication to driving innovation and collaboration in the blockchain space. As the global financial landscape evolves, Injective continues to stand at the forefront, facilitating the growth and development of Web3 finance.

This article explores the extent to which network activity can explain changes in Ethereum transaction fees. Such fees are referred to as 'gas prices' within the Ethereum blockchain, and are important inputs not only for executing transactions, but also for the deployment of smart contracts within the network. Using a bootstrapped quantile regression model, it can be shown that network activity, such as the sizes of blocks or the number of transactions and contracts, can have a heterogeneous relationship with gas prices across periods of low and high gas price changes. Of all the network activity variables examined herein, the number of intraday transactions within Ethereum's blockchain is most consistent in explaining gas fees across the full distribution of gas fee changes. From a statistical perspective, the bootstrapped quantile regression approach demonstrates that linear modeling techniques may yield but a partial view of the rich dynamics found in the full range of gas price changes' conditional distribution. This is an important finding given that Ethereum's blockchain has undergone fundamental economic and technological regime changes, such as the recent implementation of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which aims to provide an algorithmic updating rule to estimate Ethereum's 'base fee'.

This marks the second chain supported by Giddy following its initial launch on the Polygon network, and will soon be followed by other EVM-compatible networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Binance Smart Chain, and more. And, this announcement officially kicks off the start of development for native Bitcoin support in the wallet.

Ethereum Maisupport includes in-app fiat-to-crypto purchases, token swaps, sends, and shopping direct with thousands of the most recognized brands spanning more than 150 countries, and is available immediately. This is a significant milestone for Giddy as it enhances the wallet's functionality and accessibility across different blockchain networks, creating a seamless user experience regardless of network.

The key feature of the Giddy wallet is its advanced private key technology which does not require the user to write down or store a seed phrase. Instead, Giddy's private key solution splits the private key into multiple parts that are owned and managed by the user, including a user-created password, a hardware device such as their phone, and a social login like Gmail or Apple ID. Any one part is useless on its own, significantly reducing any risk of compromise. Furthermore, if one part is lost, the user can still recover their funds. If desired, the user can still export their private key.

""Giddy's private key management solution is a game changer among crypto wallets. It simplifies the user experience while enhancing security. By eliminating the need for a seed phrase and breaking down the private key into multiple factors owned by the user, we are empowering users to have more control and security over their funds,' said Eric Parker, CEO and Co-Founder of Giddy.

As the world of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance continues to evolve, Giddy is committed to providing secure, user-friendly, and cutting-edge solutions for its users. This expansion to Ethereum Maiand other EVM-compatible chains in the wallet is a major step towards achieving that goal.

About Giddy

Giddy is on a mission to make decentralized finance accessible to all. With Giddy you can buy, trade, send, earn, and shop with crypto - all from one safe and easy-to-use mobile app. Founded in 2021 by entrepreneurs Eric and Ethan Parker, Giddy's self-custody yet recoverable smart wallet means you're always in control of your money.

However, the markets are facing a range of concerns and risk aversion sentiment in general. The persistence of high interest rates for an extended period has not had a significant impact on cryptocurrencies, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum rising this week.

The weakness of the U.S. dollar has also benefited cryptocurrencies, as the price of Bitcoin has risen by about 3% in the past few hours, testing a key downward trendline. Investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are hopeful for a price recovery as we enter the positive fourth quarter of the current year before next year's ""halving"" event. Historically, cryptocurrencies have experienced notable price rebounds during the fourth quarter of each year.

There seems to be a prevailing sense of fear dominating the markets at present due to recent market developments. Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts view the idea of higher interest rates for longer periods as a threat to price recovery as the fourth quarter approaches. Higher interest rates may lead market participants to choose U.S. Treasury bonds as safe assets, weakening demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The current time is the best for investing in U.S. Treasury bonds, which could also impact high-risk assets and cryptocurrencies. Higher interest rates could also affect consumer spending and reduce estimated income, potentially harming the retail sector of the cryptocurrency industry.

This comes as asset management company VanEck prepares to launch an Ethereum Futures ETF, named the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, which will invest in physically settled and CFTC-regulated ETH futures contracts, as announced by the company in a statement earlier today. It is expected that we will hear in October whether a series of Bitcoin ETFs will be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This could change the game for the crypto market and witness a significant influx of institutional funds and liquidity into the crypto market. Already, a few Bitcoin Futures ETFs are listed on CBOE, and an Ether ETF is set to be listed as well.

In August, Bloomberg reported that U.S. securities regulators were ready to approve Ether ETF futures for trading in the United States. However, the markets remained quiet, with Bitcoin ETFs dominating the news since then. In my opinion, since many companies have already applied for regulated futures-based exchange-traded funds, VanEck's announcement today is not new or unexpected. Therefore, the fourth quarter of this year will be interesting regarding both Bitcoin ETFs and Ether Futures ETFs, especially after the SEC has faced increasing scrutiny over its proposed agenda against cryptocurrencies. Any decision it makes is likely to undergo thorough scrutiny, which could benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,9.191152,d8ed6abce42562587ca94e908bd0b12a

Important for BTC/","(MENAFN- DailyFX) Bitcoin, BTC/USD, Ethereum, ETH/USD - Price Action:



Bitcoin and Ethereum have cleared above minor resistance.

Important for BTC/USD and ETH/USD to sustain gains if the rebound is for real. What is the outlook and what are the key levels to watch?

BITCOIN: Takes on vital resistance

Bitcoin's rise to a minor resistance at the mid-September high of 27500 raises the odds that the two-month-long decline could be over. This follows a hold above strong support at the June low of 24750, which has kept intact the higher-top-higher-bottom formation since the end of 2022. Importantly, this keeps alive the possibility of a further recovery given the sharp 2021-2022 decline.

BTC/USD is now testing a key ceiling at the end-August high of 28150, coinciding with the 200-day moving average. A decisive break above could clear the path toward the July high of 31800, which could be a defining moment for Bitcoin. Any break above would not only trigger a double bottom but would reinforce the bullish medium-term trajectory, first highlighted earlier this year – see'Bitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC/USD Turns Bullish', published January 18.

BTC/USD Daily Chart

Chart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView

The potential price objective of the double bottom pattern (the June and the September lows) works out to around 39000. Such a move would imply a break above the 89-week moving average and a cross above the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts – for the first time since 2022. For the bullish view to unfold, BTC/USD needs to stay above the June low of 24750.

ETHEREUM: Beginning to flex muscles

Ethereum's break above the mid-September high of 1670 appears to have reduced immediate downside risks. This follows a hold above a crucial floor at the August low of 1535, not too far from the lower edge of a declining channel since early 2023.

ETH/USD Daily Chart

Chart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView

ETH/USD is now testing a fairly strong resistance area. This includes the end-August high of 1745, the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, and the 200-day moving average. Ethereum needs to break above 1745-1805 for the medium-term recovery trajectory to play out. So far, ETH/USD has been holding above significant long-term support on the 200-week moving average – despite the weakness since 2021, ETH/USD hasn't decisively fallen below the average.

If this morning's rebound is indeed a turning point for cryptocurrencies, ETH/USD needs to hold above the stiff support at 1450-1550.

122,Will Bitcoin Spark's Rise Lure Ethereum Miners In?,MENAFN,2023-10-01 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107170701/Will-Bitcoin-Sparks-Rise-Lure-Ethereum-Miners-In,menafn.com,--News Direct-- Introduction to Cryptocurrency Mining Cryptocurrency mining has captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and inv,"Cryptocurrency mining has captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and investors around the world. It is the process by which new digital currencies are created, and transactions are verified on a decentralized network. The two most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, rely on mining to secure their respective blockchains. Mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles using powerful computers, requiring significant computational power and energy consumption.

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading cryptocurrencies, differ in variaspects, including their mining algorithms and goals. Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consenalgorithm, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In contrast, Ethereum is moving towards a Proof of Stake (PoS) consenalgorithm, which will eliminate the need for traditional mining. Instead, Ethereum miners will need to hold and lock up a certain amount of Ethereum in a wallet to participate in the validation process.

Bitcoin Spark, a new and promising cryptocurrency, has recently gained significant attention in the crypto community. It aims to address some of the scalability and energy consumption issues associated with Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin Spark utilizes an innovative consenalgorithm that combines the security of Proof of Work with the efficiency of Proof of Stake. This hybrid approach can potentially revolutionize the mining industry and attract miners from other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.

Some say the rise of Bitcoin Spark could significantly impact Ethereum miners in the coming years. The hybrid consenalgorithm used by Bitcoin Spark offers several advantages over traditional mining methods. Firstly, Bitcoin requires significantly less computational power and energy consumption than Bitcoin mining. This makes it more accessible and cost-effective for individual miners and reduces the environmental impact of mining operations. Secondly, the innovative approach taken by Bitcoin Spark could lead to faster transaction processing and increased scalability, which are critical factors for the success of any cryptocurrency.

Moreover, Ethereum miners may be enticed by the potential rewards and incentives Bitcoin Spark offers. As the popularity and adoption of Bitcoin Spark grow, its value is expected to increase. Miners who switch from Ethereum to Bitcoin Spark would benefit from the potential appreciation of the new cryptocurrency, tmaximizing their profits. Additionally, Bitcoin Spark's hybrid consenalgorithm could provide more opportunities for miners to participate and earn rewards, as the staking component allows for passive income generation.

For those interested in diving deeper into cryptocurrency mining, several resources are available to expand their knowledge. Online forums such as Reddit and Bitcointalk provide platforms for discussions and sharing of experiences among miners. Websites like Benzinga offer comprehensive news coverage and analysis of the latest trends and developments in the cryptocurrency industry. Additionally, varionline courses and tutorials provide step-by-step guidance on how to mine different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The rise of Bitcoin Spark and its innovative hybrid consenalgorithm has the potential to reshape the cryptocurrency mining landscape. Some believe Ethereum miners may be lured by the advantages offered by Bitcoin Spark, including lower energy consumption, increased scalability, and potential rewards. Miners and investors need to stay informed about the latest advancements in the industry and explore new opportunities that emerge. With the rapid evolution of cryptocurrencies, understanding the differences between mining methods and staying up to date with the latest trends will be crucial for success in this ever-changing field.

Ethereum is being utilized in various ways, including smart contracts and payments. Research in cryptocurrency payments has either been general, about all cryptocurrencies or focused primarily on Bitcoin. Despite some similarities with Bitcoin, Ethereum is a different technology with different governance and support. This research focuses on payments with the Ethereum token, Ether, and puts forward a model of trust in Ethereum payments. Survey data analyzed using structural equation modeling supports the model. Firstly, the model has three variables from the person's individual characteristics: The user's predisposition to using innovations in (a) finance and (b) technology, influence (c) their predisposition to trust in this payment process. There are then five variables from the context: (d) Adoption and reputation, (e) stable value and low transaction fees, (f) effective regulation, (g) trust in the payment intermediaries, and (h) trust in the seller. The personal and contextual factors together influence (i) trust in the Ethereum payment process, and this leads to (j) making a payment with Ethereum.

reported
 net inflows of $21 million, breaking a persistent 
six-week drought
. With the crypto market's future continuously 
debated among experts
, such inflows mark a possible resurgence of confidence among investors.


The top cryptocurrency remained at the forefront of this resurgence, capturing most of the inflow. But as Bitcoin continues its dominance, emerging coins like Solana also signify the diversifying landscape of the crypto world. Amid these positive indicators, the Ethereum token, however, tells a different story.
 
Bitcoin And Solana Shine, Ethereum Faces The Heat


Leading the pack, Bitcoin funds reported an inflow of roughly $20.4 million in the past week. In sharp contrast, investment products betting on 
Bitcoin's decline
 witnessed an outflow of $1.5 million, suggesting a significant retreat from negative market sentiments. 


James Butterfill, CoinShares' Head of Research, pointed out the sustained relinquishment of short positions on Bitcoin, indicating a potential 
bullish sentiment
 for the top crypto.


Solana, a rising star in the crypto ecosystem, continued to impress. Reporting inflows for the 27th week this year, it added $5.1 million to its coffers, reiterating its strong market position. 


Butterfill acclaimed Solana's consistent performance, noting, 'Solana continues to shine,' emphasizing its resilience in a year that has seen numerous altcoins fluctuate.

CoinShares


On the flip side, 
Ethereum products
 haven't mirrored this positive trend. Despite being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, it registered outflows for the seventh week. 
Butterfill labeled Ethereum as the current 'least loved' altcoin.


Global Reactions And Influencing Factors On Crypto


Geographical dissections of the inflow trends offer noteworthy insights. While Europe and Canada embraced the crypto resurgence with inflows of $23 million and $17 million, respectively, the US displayed contrasting sentiments, pulling out $19 million.


Butterfill links this unexpected inflow towards the week's end to a blend of positive price momentum, apprehensions regarding US government debt prices, and the recent impasse over governmental funding. 


However, Butterfill also highlighted the low
 trading volumes across the investment product
 and crypto markets.


Amid these crypto currents, blockchain equities failed to catch the same wind, seeing outflows totaling $8.4 million. This trend mirrors the broader tech sector's direction, which also leaned towards a sell-off, as pointed out by Butterfill.
 
Notably, the fund flows in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana appear reflected even in their prices. While Bitcoin and Solana have spiked over the past day, recording a 3.3% and 6.2% upward trajectory, Ethereum has only seen a slight upward move of just 0.5% over the same period.

However, 2023 was less fruitful for Ether than enthusiasts hoped, with the Ethereum price struggling to climb. CryptoMode sheds light on the Ethereum price momentum, elucidating the hurdles and potential accelerants on the path to a $5,000 valuation in 2024.

Ethereum, a decentralized , open-source blockchain boasting smart contract functionality, has been a substantial player in the digital currency arena. Yet, the Ethereum price trajectory throughout 2023 was far from impressive, often baffling investors and market watchers. A myriad of factors contributed to this subdued market atmosphere.

Firstly, the scalability issues inherent in Ethereum's design proved to be a significant bottleneck. The network's inability to handle a surge in transactions led to slower processing times and higher fees, deterring many potential investors. Despite the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aimed to address these issues, the improvements were not immediate, further exacerbating the market's lackluster response.

Secondly, regulatory hurdles continued to cast a long shadow. Governments and financial institutions worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital currencies. This uncertainty translated into a hesitant market, with the Ethereum price feeling the brunt.

Additionally, competition from other blockchain platforms offering similar or superior functionalities also played a part in Ethereum's price stagnation. New players in the field introduced innovative solutions that threatened to overshadow Ethereum's prominence.

On the flip side, several factors could propel the Ethereum price towards the coveted $5,000 mark in 2024. The ongoing development is a primary driver. Developers still aim to solve scalability issues, significantly reducing transaction fees and increasing the network's transaction speed. Such enhancements could restore faith among investors, potentially fueling a bullish market.

Moreover, the broader adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi ) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs ) could be pivotal. These innovations, primarily built on Ethereum's blockchain, are gaining traction, and their success could translate into a higher Ethereum price.

Additionally, the market's reaction could be positive as regulatory frameworks around digital currencies become clearer and potentially more favorable. Clear regulations could provide the legitimacy and security that many potential investors seek. They may potentially trigger a surge in the Ethereum price.

Lastly, the community and developer support surrounding Ethereum remains robust. The active developer community continues to innovate and improve the platform, which could bolster Ethereum's position and price.

While 2023 was a stagnant year for the Ethereum price, various positive aspects could catalyze a shift towards a $5,000 valuation in 2024. The journey there requires overcoming existing hurdles with a keen eye on the market dynamics and innovation. As Ethereum addresses its challenges, the road to $5,000 per ETH may become a clear and attainable goal.

Terra Classic plans to get $USTC back to its dollar peg . Now, analysts speculate on the difficulty of executing that. Elsewhere, Chainlink's recent partnerships in Australia could be behind the recent $4 million $LINK purchase .

Yet, Borroe.Finance's ($ROE) approach to revenue financing is stealing the spotlight. Some analysts say $ROE's recent 50% growth could make it one of the top crypto coins . Are these projections realistic? Let's discuss.

>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<

Borroe.Finance ($ROE) uses blockchain technology to grant wider visibility to loan requests on its platform. This ensures that companies have a higher chance of getting their loan requests approved. Furthermore, Borroe.Finance is an easy way for users to invest in low-risk opportunities with high profit margins.

Each Borroe.Finance ($ROE) member is entitled to low costs , instant funding , and special marketplace rewards . Furthermore, members can access on and off-ramp crypto and fiat payment solutions.

With its unique services and strong market projections, Borroe.Finance could easily become one of the best DeFi crypto projects. $ROE is already in Stage 2 of its presale, costing $0.0150. It has already grown by 50% from its initial price of $0.0100.

By Stage 3 of its presale, $ROE would have risen by 33.3% to reach $0.0200.

And it doesn't end there. Projections highlight $0.0400 as the final price for the presale, meaning current buyers will benefit from 167% ROI . This surge far exceeds the numbers of Terra Classic and even the popular Chainlink for 2023.

Ethereum (ETH) has been on a downward slide over the past ten days, losing 10% of its value since the beginning of October.

This prolonged decline has led many traders to shift their attention to alternative coins with better price potential than ETH.

One coin gaining attention in this regard is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) – which recently crossed the $1 million mark in its ongoing presale.

ETH has struggled to maintain its footing above the key support at $1,550, tapping the level several times over the past few days.

After reaching highs of around $1,750 at the beginning of October, ETH has since lost substantial value amid a broader risk-off environment in the crypto market.

The technical picture looks weak for Ethereum, with price trading below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the daily time frame.

Even if ETH were to rebound from its current level, the token would likely encounter resistance around $1,600, which has previously acted as support.

On the other hand, if ETH closed below the crucial $1,550 zone, this could trigger a steep sell-off to the wick around $1,530 – or even lower.

With ETH trading volume also falling 9% in the past da , this indicates reduced interest from traders – potentially making the token more vulnerable to sharp declines.

A key factor weighing on Ethereum lately has been selling pressure from prominent figures in the network's ecosystem.

On-chain data shows that addresses associated with Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have recently liquidated millions worth of ETH into fiat, sparking speculation around their motives.

Much attention has been paid to Buterin's transactions specifically, given that they could be viewed as questionable considering his influence over Ethereum.

This selling pressure comes amid other challenges for ETH, like increased regulatory scrutiny on the crypto market as a whole.

Moreover, the newly launched ETH futures ETFs saw poor demand last week, raising concerns that institutional investors aren't as bullish on Ethereum as previously thought.

With this confluence of negative factors, it's no surprise that the ETH price has struggled recently.

With Ethereum faltering, traders are shifting funds into alternative coins that are showing more momentum.

One example is the new presale token Bitcoin Minetrix, which offers an innovative way for everyday investors to mine BTC through the cloud.

Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is a promising new cryptocurrency that seeks to change how Bitcoin mining works through its revolutionary Stake-to-Mine mechanism.

This mechanism allows users to stake BTCMTX, Bitcoin Minetrix's native token, to earn ""mining credits.""

These mining credits can then be burned to access cloud mining power, allowing users to generate recurring BTC rewards.

Staking BTCMTX tokens also produces rewards, with an impressive 571% APY on offe for those who decide to pledge.

Ultimately, by simplifying the process of crypto mining, BTCMTX makes the process more democratic, flexible, and accessible.

This novel concept has already led to substantial presale success, with over $1 million raised and almost 2,000 people following Bitcoin Minetrix's Twitter accoun .

The project's presale will have ten stages, each with a gradually increasing price point, meaning those who invest during Stage 1 will be rewarded with the lowest entry price, set at $0.011.

Major influencers have also discussed Bitcoin Minetrix's passive income potential, with Michael Wrubel highlighting the planned exchange listing as a reason to be'bullish' on BTCMTX.

Looking ahead, Bitcoin Minetrix's team has bold plans to continue expanding, aiming to launch a mobile app and foster strategic partnerships to boost cloud mining capacity.

With Ethereum's prospects looking increasingly bleak, BTCMTX is positioning itself as a viable alternative in the final months of 2023.

In addition, the blockchain enables transaction processing and the creation of smart contracts. It empowers end users to execute contracts without any intermediate entities. However, there are some issues when it comes to retrieving information, such as the state and history of smart contracts and regular transactions in the blockchain. For example, in a smart contract, user-defined data structures can be used to recall the state of the smart contract for a range query, which can decrease the general performance. In addition, an external database can be required to retrieve regular transactions for range queries, which increases management costs. To achieve this, we propose a new scheme that enables SQL query operations to retrieve a smart contract and regular transaction information within the blockchain system. To achieve this, we combine an embedded relational database with an Ethereum-based blockchain system to provide the SQL query. It enables range queries on smart contracts without requiring user-defined data structures and decreases management costs for regular transactions without any external database. We implement the proposed blockchain system on quorum, which is an Ethereum-based blockchain system. Also, we evaluate the proposed system using a synthetic benchmark.

This paper reports our findings on the return dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum using high-frequency data (minute-by-minute observations) from 2015 to 2022 for Bitcoin and from 2016 to 2022 for Ethereum. The main objective of modeling these two series was to obtain a dynamic estimation of risk premium with the intention of characterizing its behavior. To this end, we estimated the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity in Mean with Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution (GARCH-M-NIG) model for the residuals. We also estimated the other parameters of the model and discussed their evolution over time, including the skewness and kurtosis of the Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution. Similarly, we determined the parameters that define the evolution of the estimated variance, i.e., the parameters related to the fitted past variance, square error and long-term average value. We found that, despite the market uncertainty during the COVID-19 emergency period (2020 and 2021), the selected cryptocurrencies' return volatility and kurtosis were even greater for several other subperiods within our sample's time frame. Our model represents an analytical tool that estimates the risk premium that should be delivered by Bitcoin and Ethereum and is therefore of interest to risk managers, traders and investors.


 










 


The sanitary emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic induced much turbulence in most economic sectors and, naturally, in the financial markets. Its effects during 2020 and 2021 were significantly greater than those of the financial crisis of 2008 [
1
,
2
,
3
]. From an economic point of view, the two most significant consequences were high global inflation rates during 2022 (resulting from a complex combination of supply constrains in the product and labor markets and economic agents' expectations) and the aggressive anti-recessionary policies implemented by many countries. In February 2022, inflation levels in the United States were recorded to be at a historical maximum of 7.9% (their highest in 20 years). Business and consumption worldwide were impacted, and the global economy underwent negative growth. For example, the US GDP saw a reduction of 19.2% between the last quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020, with the unemployment rate reaching 14.7% in April 2020, its highest level since 1948; this represented 23.1 million people without jobs. Between March 21st and July 18th 2020, 52.7 million citizens applied for unemployment insurance [
4
]. As an example of extraordinary anti-recessionary policies, the monetary measures taken by the United States government and its central bank represented an almost six trillion-dollar injection of money to the economy, and the reference interest rate dropped to almost zero.
Financial markets experienced their worse crash since the 2008–2009 turmoil. With huge transfers of money from the stock market to treasury bonds, the stock market's upward trend that had lasted since 2009 finally ended. The turning point can be identified as March 2020, when the sanitary emergency and its associated constraints hit the market. However, significant recovery was observed during the second quarter of 2020, a period in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ increased by 18%, 20% and 31%, respectively [
5
].
The behavior of the cryptocurrency market was significantly different, which requires some explanation. Cryptocurrency trading is supported by Blockchain technology, a platform with the following distinctive characteristics:
(1)
There are no financial intermediaries, i.e., there is no middleman between buyers and sellers. It is a peer-to-peer technology, according to Harwick [
6
] and Dwyer [
7
].
(2)
It is decentralized and the government cannot control it, at least theoretically, as proposed by Dwyer [
7
] and Rose [
8
].
(3)
In terms of security, if the network has a problematic area, the non-affected areas can review the whole transaction flow with no problem. This is an important characteristic of Blockchain technology.
(4)
It is almost anonymous in its operation, Fang et al. [
9
].
(5)
It is open for operation 24 h, 7 days a week.
Since the introduction of Bitcoin and until December 2019, approximately 4950 cryptocurrencies were created (see Fang et al. [
9
]), and their market capitalization value was around 190 billion dollars in 2019. Bitcoin and Ethereum were the most important that year in terms of their market capitalization, representing 64% of the total in March [
10
].
Financial security time-varying risk premium estimation was introduced by Engle et al. [
11
], and led to a vast number of papers being published on this topic in the following decades. Authors who have analyzed the risk/return relationship using high-frequency data include Baron et al. [
12
], who use a sample of the leading Swedish equity index, the OMX S30; Almeida et al. [
13
], who study the S&P 500's futures returns; and Ji [
14
], who works with the Shanghai 50. Breckenfelder [
15
] presents an interesting theoretical discussion on the tradeoff between risk and return using high-frequency data.
In this paper, we study the time dynamics of risk premium for Bitcoin and Ethereum during the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 periods, using high-frequency data (minute-by-minute). A GARCH(1,1)-M-NIG model with 1440 daily observations was used because its parameters can be interpreted as an asset's risk premium. To achieve improved adjustment, the residuals were modeled with a semi-heavy-tail distribution (Normal-Inverse Gaussian). This approach enables the observation of the model's parameters throughout the observation period. Modeling the risk premium permits monitoring the behavior of Bitcoin and Ethereum to support investors in their decision making.
We hypothesized that the parameters of our model would show important variations during the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subperiods. We found that the former subperiod was not associated with the largest observed volatility during the analysis. The risk premium parameter varied considerably in subperiods that were different from the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subperiods. These variations were associated with time series bias and kurtosis, which, in addition to conveying valuable information for risk management (since we worked with intraday data), allowed us to better understand the behavior of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate the existence of a relationship between price bubble episodes and exuberant behavior in the skewness and kurtosis of the returns distribution. The daily estimation of the model's parameters supports finer calibration for risk managers and portfolio managers.
The interpretation of the GARCH model is straightforward and provides dynamic updates for supporting risk-management decisions. The variations in the parameters—which are random by nature—allow the dynamic behavior to be described with more precision to support decision making, especially when there are important variations. In contrast to other studies of high-frequency data (e.g., Pele et al. [
16
], Louzis [
17
], Degiannakis [
18
], Giot [
19
], Dionne [
20
] and Beltratti [
21
]), we present a model that explicitly shows the dynamic evolution of risk premium, not just the returns and volatility typically modeled by the GARCH Family models. While Gyamerah [
22
] uses the NIG distribution for residuals, they do not review the parameters of the distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the behaviors of the skewness '




ρ




' and shape '




ζ




' parameters are discussed using high-frequency data for Bitcoin and Ethereum. An additional contribution of this paper is that we developed GARCH-M-NIG modeling by day, i.e., we studied the evolution of the parameters with daily frequency, which was possible thanks to minute-by-minute data availability. The COVID-19 period did not show the largest variability during the period of study. Instead, the observed market bubbles of the previous year represented the period with the highest variance. This was reflected in the 2019 risk premium parameter.
This work provides a better understanding of the variability of Bitcoin and Ethereum by modeling their returns and volatility. The reported findings are expected to provide support for improving investments and risk management practices.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2
 presents a literature review; 
Section 3
 discusses the methodology used in our analysis; 
Section 4
 contains a description of the data and presents the estimation results; and 
Section 5
 concludes the paper.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the market and is currently the most important in its category; for these reasons, it has attracted a significant amount of of research attention. Studies of its returns' volatility have used GARCH-type models, as in Bariviera et al. [
23
], Katsiampa [
24
] and Troster et al. [
25
] (note: Charles [
26
] re-estimated Katsiampa's model using the same data and an extended observation set to find partially different results, and concluded that 'GARCH-type models characterized by short memory, asymmetric effects, or long-run and short-run movements, seem not to be appropriate for modeling the Bitcoin returns', contributing to a better understanding of this modeling technique).
Conrad [
27
] found that Bitcoin volatility has an inverse relationship with the volatility of the S&P500, and at the same time exhibits pro-cyclical behavior relative to the behavior of gold in periods of higher S&P500 volatility. In a related study, Al-Khazali et al. [
28
] discovered an asymmetric response between Bitcoin and gold volatility in the presence of positive or negative macroeconomic news.
Wen [
29
] demonstrated that Bitcoin is not a safe-haven asset, and Briere et al. [
30
] studies the possibilities that Bitcoin represents for portfolio diversification. Before the COVID-19 pandemic period, Feng et al. [
31
] proved the ability of Bitcoin and gold to achieve risk diversification.
For the period of 2014–2018, Kaya [
32
] used a family of GARCH models to discover the presence of long memory in the volatility of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple (which represented 86% of total market capitalization). A similar finding for Bitcoin was reported by Bouri et al. [
33
], and for seven other cryptocurrencies by Lahmiri et al. [
34
].
Long memory implies predictability, as demonstrated by Mensi et al. [
35
], in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a better risk–return tradeoff in portfolios, as established by Gil-Alana et al. [
36
], in the case of different financial indices.
Comparing volatilities, Liu et al. [
37
] showed that cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple) have greater volatility (with weekly and monthly frequencies) than stocks, and greater volatility than fiat money and metals (euro, UK pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, gold, platinum and silver).
Nie [
38
] studied the structure of changes in the correlation matrix of the top 100 cryptocurrencies according to their market capitalization and using Minimum Spanning Trees. The author addresses two main questions: 'do the correlation dynamics in the cryptocurrency market include critical events?' and 'is there synchronization between correlation dynamics and the structural dynamics of the correlation networks?'. Shi et al. [
39
] used a multi-factor stochastic volatility model to analyze the different correlations of twelve cryptocurrencies before the COVID-19 pandemic period.
In Chuffart [
40
], cryptocurrencies' conditional correlations were reported to have changed after the 2017 bubble burst, but other studies (e.g., Baur et al. [
41
]) report that Bitcoin has no correlation with other assets (bonds, commodities and stocks) during either normal or crisis periods. Similarly, with a panel with 300 cryptocurrencies, Bianchi [
42
] reported a weak relationship between the returns of cryptocurrencies and the returns of different commodities.
Cryptocurrencies are characterized by high and persistent volatility, as reported by Yaya et al. [
43
] in a study using twelve cryptocurrencies for the period of 2015–2018. Along the same lines, cryptocurrencies exhibit time-varying volatility and leverage effects, as reported by Catania et al. [
44
].
Several authors have stated that cryptocurrencies' market structure characteristics differed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Samut et al. [
45
] tested two alternative hypotheses on the correlation and causal relationship between the returns volatility and trading volume of financial assets, and found that the sequential information arrival hypothesis offered a more adequate description of the cryptocurrency market during the pre-pandemic period, but that during the pandemic period, the mixture of distribution hypothesis was more pertinent. By contrast, Goodell et al. [
46
] showed that movements of Bitcoin prices were related to the global number of deaths during the pandemic. Both studies reveal a changing market structure.
Several authors have tried GARCH modeling and forecasting cryptocurrencies' volatility. For example, Cheikh et al. [
47
] used a Smooth-Transition GARCH model to discover the presence of positive return–volatility relationships for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Catania et al. [
44
] studied the volatility characteristics (long memory, asymmetries, time-varying skewness and kurtosis) of 606 cryptocurrencies. Chu et al. [
48
] studied the volatility of Bitcoin, Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Maidsafecoin, Monero and Ripple using twelve different models and five different criteria for the selection of the best GARCH (IGARCH and GJRGARH) model. Gyamerah [
22
] proposed that the GARCH-NIG model is the best for assessing the volatility of the returns of Bitcoin. Woebbeking [
49
] computed a volatility index based on the implied volatility of Bitcoin options to study the market's expectations of future volatility during a period that included the COVID-19 pandemic.
Baur et al. [
41
] reviewed volatility asymmetry in response to positive and negative news for the top 20 cryptocurrencies using a TGARCH-AR(1) model, and discovered that while in equity markets the volatility response to negative news was greater than the response to positive news, and in the case of cryptocurrencies (except XEM and OMG), the opposite effect was present. Similarly, Bhattacharya et al. [
50
] used EGARCH and TGRACH to find that asymmetry existed in ETH, BNB and CIX among a sample of six cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to August 2021. According to the results obtained by Shi et al. [
39

Set against Devconnect 2023, a week-long gathering that features independent Ethereum events, Ethereum 2030 convenes both international and local experts to explore the next wave of innovations shaping the future of Ethereum and a new generation of crypto entrepreneurship.

Here's what global leaders had to say about Ethereum and the broader blockchain and Web3 ecosystem.

TradFi Players to Increasingly Integrate On-chain Solutions

In a panel discussion on decentralized finance (DeFi), speakers explored recent changes in the DeFi market structure and some promising new narratives. Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital mentioned the fact that DeFi protocols are becoming MEV conscious, which could be a huge thing and make the whole system way more profitable. Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol shared her opinion about why zero-knowledge proofs and account abstraction technologies have great potential in DeFi. Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde and Enzyme Finance, emphasized the importance of having more traditional finance (TradFi) players integrating on-chain solutions because some could continue to be the last-mile access for users.

They also talked about the rise of liquid staking derivatives and whether the current state of Ethereum staking had a concentration issue. Other topics covered include real-world assets, growing awareness of DeFi, restaking solutions, and the ongoing battle to reach the masses.

The panel discussion was moderated by Daria Krasnova, Managing Editor at BeInCrypto and participated by Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital, Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde & Enzyme Finance, Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol, Mete (Ali) Başkaya, Blockchain & Crypto Lecturer and Seraphim Czecker, Head of Growth at Ethena Labs.

AI-powered Builder Identification

Jack He, Co-founder of Aspecta shared how they are leveraging AI technologies like large language models (LLM) and image recognition to build an identity solution for builders to consolidate their behavior data across different platforms.

Aspecta enables builders to create LinkedIn-like identity pages and credentials to showcase their skills, experience, and impact, which the team believes fills an important gap and helps to facilitate growth and collaboration among different developer ecosystems.

Collaboration among Security Solution Providers Needed

In a panel discussion on Web3 security, security experts from MetaMask Snaps, Matter Labs, Certik, DTS Project, and MetaTrust Labs shared their observations as to the current state of Web3 security and some of the emerging threats.

From a technical perspective, they also shared some cutting-edge solutions designed to safeguard the Web3 ecosystem and the lessons learned from the high-profile hacks in the last year.

Anıl Öz, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project emphasized that he thought every cyber security service provider should collaborate and share their knowledge to build a safer and more secure Web3 future.

Lastly, they talked about how individuals can effectively guard against personal losses by using tools such as browser extensions and Metamask's Blockaid security alerts, an experimental function to be standardized in Q1 2024.

The panel discussion was moderated by Sima Baktas, Web3 Attorney at GlobalB Law and Co-Founder of CryptoFemale, Anton Astafiev, VP of Security at Matter Labs, Christian Montoya, Senior Product Owner at MetaMask Snaps, Connie Lam, Head of Solution Architect at CertiK, Anıl Öz, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project and TY Shao, Chief Business Officer at MetaTrust Labs.

Crypto Entrepreneurs Gaining Valuable Experience during the Bear Market

In a panel discussion on crypto entrepreneurship, global and local project leaders shared their firsthand experience of building cryptocurrency businesses. While they highlighted challenges such as user education, lack of service providers, lack of prior examples to draw upon as well as legal and regulatory uncertainties, they shared an opinion that building products that solve real-world problems, focusing on user experiences, and finding creative ways to collaborate with other players are critical strategies founders should prioritize to navigate through these challenges.

Commenting on the phenomenon that many crypto entrepreneurs are pivoting to AI to capture venture capital's interest, Bertuğ Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify noted that entrepreneurs should build products for their customers instead of investors. He advised startups to'ride the hype' when necessary but always build the war chest for survival as founders will eventually have to face a bear market.

Arif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX added to underline that marketing and communications is a non-stop process and should not be undervalued in bear markets.

Commenting on Turkey's crypto landscape, Erkan Gül, Founder of Moseiki App mentioned that the number of trader communities is too high compared to builder communities, but the transformation is underway.

The panel discussion was moderated by Özge ERDEMİR, Web3 Advisor, Business Developer, and participated by Bertuğ Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify, Erkan Gül, Founder of Moseiki App, Victor Yu, Co-Founder of Carv and Arif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX.

A New Paradigm to Secure Protocols and LP Assets on Ethereum

Yajin (Andy) Zhou, CEO of Blocksec launched Phalcon Block, an automated attack-blockchain system, at the conference. Phalcon Block offers an integrated solution that combines protocol monitoring, attack blocking, and incident response, ensuring secure operations of protocols after they go live. He introduced that Phalcon Block has been developed and internally operated for two years and during this period, it has blocked over 20 attack incidents and helped protocols recover over $14 million worth of digital asset losses.

The event, also featuring keynote speakers including Volkan KORKMAZ, CEO and Co-Founder of Altcointurk, Azeem Khan, Head of Impact at Gitcoin, and Fatih Taşdemir, Co-Founder of Koin Bülteni, presented attendees with an impactful fall day of knowledge sharing, inspiration, and enthusiasm.

Ethereum price is unable to find enough support from investors to push the altcoin beyond $2,142.

Institutional investors did pour money into ETH this past month, but year to date, they are still noting $55 million worth of outflows.

Whales, too, are booking profits on the short-term scale, selling nearly $1 billion worth of ETH in two days.

Ethereum price is back to trading above one of the most important psychological support levels, but it seems like this rally might not stick this time around either. The altcoin leader is facing resistance on the one hand and a lack of support from the investors on the other, making it rather difficult to break this seven-month-old curse.

Ethereum price reclaims key support

Ethereum price is trading at $2,062 after charting a 6.75% growth over the past 24 hours. The $2,000 support line is crucial not only for ETH to rally further but also acts as a key psychological support level.

The recent bullish divergence observed on the RSI confirmed that the demand for the asset was high at the beginning of Q4 but faltered as soon as ETH hit $2,124. This line has been acting as a resistance since April, and Ethereum has been unable to breach it for the second time.

The last time this level was successfully breached was back in April 2021. The potential of the same this time around is rather low, too, given the Relative Strength Index (RSI) does seem to be in the bullish zone, but the On Balance Volume (OBV) has not been rising in accordance with the price action.

Theoretically, when both price and OBV are making lower peaks and lower troughs, the downward trend is likely to continue. This means that ETH breaking out of the downtrend line is most likely a fakeout, and the altcoin will fall back down to lose the support of $2,000. This would send it back towards $1,900 or $1,795.

ETH/USD 1-day chart

On the off chance that investors push through, Ethereum could manage to test $2,124 as resistance again. Breaching it would invalidate the bearish thesis and open ETH to reaching $2,200.

Big wallet holders are still wary

One of the key causes of Ethereum being unable to breach $2,124 is the lack of support it is receiving from large wallet investors such as whales and institutions. For the week ending November 17, ETH managed to bring in only $3.3 million from institutions, which is lower than even Solana's $13.6 million.

While the month-to-date flows have seemingly improved, year to date, ETH is still noting outflows amounting to $55 million.

Ethereum institutional flows

Similarly, the whale addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million ETH, which have been key drivers of the price action. Even they seem to be skeptical at the moment, as they sold nearly over $948 million worth of 460,000 ETH in the span of two days to book profits and offset losses, bringing their holding to 20.06 million ETH.

Thus, as long as Ethereum fails to gain the conviction of these key cohorts, the price action will most likely continue to falter.",fxstreet.com,7502,news,ES,en,,https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Cryptocurrencies/Coins/Ethereum/ethereum_Large.jpg,False,@FXStreetUpdate,8.081144,e6eae74d97441cf27a7f2f5b47e2fa54

The Ethereum market opened Tuesday's trading session with a pullback, appearing to stumble momentarily before regaining its footing. In this evolving landscape, it seems we are in the process of constructing what resembles an ascending triangle formation.

Nevertheless, looming on the horizon is a formidable barrier of resistance situated around the $2100 threshold, an area that commands our utmost attention. Should we manage to surmount this obstacle, the path ahead appears paved for a substantial ascent, with the market likely setting its sights on the $2500 level.

Amidst these fluctuations, it is my belief that the $1900 level will play a pivotal role as a robust support level during short-term pullbacks. Notably, the 50-Day EMA appears to be swiftly converging with this critical zone, potentially reinforcing its significance. It is essential to acknowledge that these cryptocurrency markets are characterized by a cacophony of activity, necessitating careful discernment as we endeavor to ascertain whether the market possesses the requisite momentum to forge ahead or if a more substantial retracement looms on the horizon, potentially leading us down to the 200-Day EMA Policy and Crypto

It is worth noting that the allure of cryptocurrencies appears to be gaining momentum as traders increasingly ponder the inevitability of central banks worldwide resorting to monetary policy adjustments. Indeed, it is evident that higher interest rates have proven detrimental to the cryptocurrency realm, a fact underscored by various scandals that have surfaced during periods of tight monetary policy. It now appears that we are gradually emerging from this conundrum, and should this trend persist, Ethereum stands poised to reap significant benefits. However, it is imperative to keep a watchful eye on Bitcoin, as it wields a pronounced ""knock-on effect"" on the entire cryptocurrency sphere, Ethereum included.

Ultimately, while the Ethereum market remains a magnet for investor interest, it is essential to acknowledge that we must navigate through a substantial degree of market exuberance following the recent rapid ascent. These intriguing dynamics will undoubtedly continue to unfold, prompting traders to exercise caution, conduct meticulous analysis, and stay attuned to developments that could shape the cryptocurrency landscape in the days and weeks to come.

Recently, there has been a marked increase","(MENAFN- eTrendy Stock) The Ethereum staking pool, a crucial component of the Ethereum blockchain, witnesses a significant shift. Recently, there has been a marked increase in the number of validators withdrawing their stakes. This trend, particularly pronounced since October 2023, correlates with a broader bullish uptrend across digital asset markets.

Glassnode's insights highlight that the increasing exits of validators contribute to a decline in daily Ethereum (ETH) issuance. That is directly related to the active ETH within the staking pool. Moreover, there's been a noticeable uptick in network activity, primarily driven by renewed interest in tokens and stablecoins. As a result, network fees are being pushed higher.

The surge in validators exiting the staking pool aligns with the recent uptrend in spot prices across digital asset markets. This exodus has been particularly pronounced since the Shanghai upgrade, which enabled stake withdrawals. Exiting events have considerably increased, averaging 1018 validators per day, significantly higher than earlier averages. This trend points to a strategic reshuffling of staking providers and setups by validators.

This validator exodus has had several consequences:

: The Total Effective Balance represents the ETH actively participating in Proof-of-Stake consensus, has seen its first decline since the Shanghai upgrade. The growth rate of this balance has more than halved since May.: A significant portion of the exodus is voluntary, distinct from protocol rule violations. That suggests a strategic decision-making process by validators rather than forced exits due to non-compliance.: Centralized exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase have seen significant stake withdrawals. Meanwhile, liquid staking providers like Lido, despite experiencing stake withdrawals, continue to grow in dominance.: Various factors influence this trend, including changes in staking setups, capital rotation towards safer assets due to elevated interest rates, and the anticipation of a market uptrend leading to a preference for more liquid assets.: Validators earn rewards for participating in the staking pool, contributing to network security.: Validators play a critical role in maintaining the security and integrity of the Ethereum network.: Staking ETH results in reduced liquidity, as staked ETH is locked up for a period.: Exposure to market volatility can affect the value of staked ETH and rewards.

The trend of Ethereum validators exiting the staking pool is a significant development. It indicates a dynamic response by participants to market conditions and network changes. The reduction in ETH issuance and the increased burned ETH via EIP1559 have resulted in a deflationary trend for ETH. As such, there is no immediate cause for concern.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/01/eS_6ebfeimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,9.474559,ad062738aed6f1f68e9bdf7714b18d32

The Ethereum market maintained a sense of calm during the early hours of Thursday's trading session, hovering just slightly above the critical $2000 threshold.

The significance of this level cannot be overstated, as it represents a substantial, round figure that has captured the market's attention. Recent weeks have witnessed some turbulence in the market, hinting at the possibility of lingering uncertainty.

The current market actions suggest that support may be identified as far down as the $1925 level, while the $2125 level stands as a formidable barrier of resistance overhead. In other words, the market appears to be ""stuck"" within this range.

Taking a broader perspective, Ethereum continues to experience volatility, primarily driven by ongoing developments in the bond market. The bond market's performance carries substantial weight when it comes to interest rates, which, in turn, exert a profound influence on cryptocurrency markets. Cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included, often grapple with challenges in environments characterized by central banks' tightening monetary policies Monetary Policy

It is worth noting that such a policy stance has only been witnessed once before, and it had adverse effects on the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, if market participants continue to perceive a dovish stance on interest rates, the likelihood is high that cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum, will continue their ascent.

In the current climate of uncertainty, it is crucial to acknowledge that the Ethereum market remains immersed in a state of turmoil, demanding a certain level of clarity regarding interest rates to chart a definitive course. Nonetheless, indications point towards the probability of ongoing consolidation leading to further continuation. However, should Ethereum breach the $1800 level on the downside, it could find itself facing significant challenges.

Furthermore, close attention must be paid to Bitcoin's movements, as it often acts as a precursor to the broader cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin experiences a rally, Ethereum is likely to follow suit. Conversely, if Bitcoin encounters selling pressure, Ethereum could experience a substantial downturn.

At the end of the day, Ethereum's journey ahead remains uncertain, particularly given its proximity to the pivotal $2000 level. The intricate interplay between interest rates and cryptocurrency performance remains a critical variable to monitor, especially as we observe movements in the US bond markets with rates on the decline. While Ethereum seems poised for further price action, its ultimate trajectory will be influenced by various external factors, including the performance of Bitcoin.

The Ethereum market has maintained a sense of calm in the early hours of Wednesday trading, as it continues to hang out just above the critical $2000 threshold.

The significance of this level cannot be understated, as it represents a substantial, round, and psychologically potent figure that has garnered keen attention from market participants. In recent weeks, the market has been characterized by heightened volatility, signaling that a period of uncertainty may still be in the cards.

The prevailing dynamics in this market suggest that support can be found all the way down to the $1925 level, while the $2125 level looms overhead, presenting a formidable barrier of resistance. In other words, there is a lot of noise above and below.

Broadly speaking, Ethereum remains ensconced in a realm of pronounced price fluctuations, a phenomenon that can be attributed to the ongoing scrutiny of the bond market. The bond market's performance has a significant bearing on interest rates, which, in turn, exert a profound influence on the cryptocurrency arena. Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, tend to fare poorly in environments characterized by tight monetary policy Policy is Crucial

It's worth noting that we have only experienced such a policy once, and it had detrimental consequences for the cryptocurrency market. Thus, if market participants continue to witness a dovish stance on interest rates, it's highly probable that cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum, will continue to ascend.

In this milieu of uncertainty, it's crucial to acknowledge that the Ethereum market remains entrenched in a state of tumult, demanding a measure of fundamental clarity regarding interest rates to chart a definitive course. Nonetheless, signs point towards the likelihood of ongoing consolidation leading to further price movements. Nevertheless, should Ethereum breach the $1800 level to the downside, it could find itself in a precarious position.

Additionally, vigilant attention must be paid to Bitcoin, as it often serves as a harbinger for the broader cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin embarks on a rally, Ethereum is likely to follow suit. Conversely, should Bitcoin falter, Ethereum could face a severe downturn.

At the end of the day, Ethereum's journey is one of uncertainty, underscored by its proximity to the pivotal $2000 mark. The interplay between interest rates and cryptocurrency performance remains a significant factor to watch. Ethereum seems poised for further price action, but its ultimate direction hinges on a variety of external factors, including Bitcoin's performance and interest rate trends.

The Ethereum market exhibited a noteworthy rally during the trading session on Friday, making it clear that we are on the verge of a crucial test at the $2125 threshold.

This particular level has proven to be quite resilient, resisting previous attempts to breach it. However, should Ethereum successfully overcome this hurdle, it is poised for a significant upward surge. In this optimistic scenario, Ethereum presents an enticing prospect for investors, particularly when considering the robust support situated beneath it at the $1925 level. Adding to the intrigue, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is rapidly approaching this pivotal zone.

Broadly speaking, the Ethereum market is characterized by a persistent degree of volatility. Its performance is undeniably influenced by Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that typically holds sway over the entire digital asset landscape. Additionally, the United States' interest rates exert a pronounced impact on these markets, leading to a substantial inverse correlation between Ethereum and the 10-year Treasury yield. In essence, there are multiple factors at play, contributing to a considerable degree of market noise.

Given the current circumstances, we find ourselves in a state of uncertainty as to whether a breakout from this range is imminent. Nonetheless, our strategy remains clear – we should be inclined to ""buy on the dips."" Concurrently, Bitcoin appears determined to embark on its own breakout journey.

US Dollar Continues to Matter

The strength of the US dollar is another variable of significance within the market. Ethereum's valuation is denominated in US dollars, rendering it susceptible to fluctuations in the currency's value. A weakening US dollar tends to favor the Ethereum market, while a strengthening dollar could impede its upward momentum. On the day in question, the US dollar demonstrated a slight resurgence, suggesting that Ethereum may not be poised for an immediate breakout. Consequently, we must adopt a prudent approach, seeking value opportunities and keeping a watchful eye on external factors that may tilt the market in our favor.

Once Ethereum successfully breaches the $2125 threshold, it is highly probable that it will set its sights on the $2300 level above. To sum up, the Ethereum market is expected to persist in its characteristic state of volatility, presenting both opportunities and challenges for traders and investors alike.

Potential signal: I am a buyer of ETH @ $2125, which could happen this weekend? I would have a stop loss at $2030, and a target of $2300.

A striking example is the emerging field of blockchain,"(MENAFN- eTrendy Stock) The integration of academic learning with real-world applications is more crucial than ever. A striking example is the emerging field of blockchain and cryptocurrency. That gap between academia and industry presents unique challenges and opportunities.

Peter Szilagyi, a leading figure in the Ethereum community, recently highlighted this disconnect. He is disappointed by his alma mater's response to collaboration opportunities in blockchain technology.

Szilagyi, who plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum team, shared his experiences returning to his university to discuss Ethereum. He observed a disturbing trend: students seemed more intrigued by the fluctuating prices of Ethereum rather than the technological and innovative aspects of the project. This focus on the monetary aspect overshadows blockchain technology's deeper, more substantial elements. It underscores a broader issue in the educational approach to emerging tech sectors.

Szilagyi proactively organized a grant for nine students to attend Devconnect to bridge this gap. The event aimed to foster development in the blockchain space. This initiative included covering expenses like flights and accommodation. Yet, despite his efforts, the students needed more awareness about the source and purpose of the grant. This disconnect highlights a missed opportunity for educational institutions to engage students in meaningful, industry-related experiences.

Szilagyi's attempts to involve his university further by seeking recommendations for student collaborations were met with silence. Despite contacting several contacts, including those involved in the grant process, his emails received no response. This lack of engagement from the academic side is not just a missed opportunity for students. It also reflects a broader reluctance in academia to embrace emerging technologies like blockchain.

Contrastingly, the demand for blockchain and cryptocurrency knowledge is rising in the corporate world. Major companies like Oracle, Amazon, and Google increasingly seek individuals with expertise in these areas to develop new blockchain products. This growing interest is a clear signal of the potential and importance of blockchain technology in the modern business landscape.

There is an evident increase in interest, particularly among information systems students, in learning about decentralized applications. This surge in curiosity reflects a growing awareness of the potential and applicability of blockchain technology in various sectors. However, the lack of structured academic programs and collaborations with industry leaders like Ethereum remains a significant barrier.

Despite these challenges, it is evident that the journey toward a harmonious integration of academic curricula with blockchain technology is still in its early stages. The potential for collaborative efforts between universities and industry leaders like Ethereum is immense. Such partnerships could enhance students' educational experience and contribute significantly to the development and application of blockchain technology.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/03/eS_c7f8bimage_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,9.0756645,8a6888b939ea3848fc8c38e3c792fb9b

This surge is primarily fueled by the growing excitement over the potential approval of a spot ETH Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States.

Despite Ethereum's impressive market performance, a closer look reveals a stagnation in its user base growth. It raises a critical question: Can Ethereum's value continue its upward trajectory if its user base starts to expand?

The cryptocurrency realm, still healing from the severe downturn of 2022, has shown impressive resilience. The market has rebounded significantly, with Ethereum leading the way. As such, the overall market capitalization has ballooned by over half a trillion dollars in recent months, indicating a robust recovery.

Ethereum, renowned for being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has gained immense popularity. It's especially favored by enthusiasts in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other blockchain-driven sectors. However, recent data from IntoTheBlock suggests a curious trend: a lack of significant new user engagement with Ethereum.

The situation with Ethereum stands in stark contrast to Bitcoin's current state. Bitcoin has continually increased its user base, with the number of active, non-zero balance wallets surpassing 50 million. This indicates a growing interest in Bitcoin, but such enthusiasm has not been mirrored in Ethereum's user metrics.

All eyes are now on the United States SEC regarding their decision on a spot Ethereum ETF . If approved, this could be a game-changer for Ethereum. The anticipation of this decision alone might catalyze a further surge in Ethereum's price, possibly attracting new users and investors.

Ethereum's current market performance is commendable, yet it highlights a crucial aspect for sustained growth – expanding its user base. With potential regulatory developments on the horizon, Ethereum's journey is one to watch closely. Any significant change could redefine its market dynamics and user engagement.

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has demonstrated resilience and potential. However, the real test lies in its ability to attract and retain a broader user base. That metric will be pivotal in determining its long-term success and market position.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/12/eS_147b6image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,17.91335,e50f249e2d8aea4e6d93bc993758e77f

Ethereum exhibited a back-and-forth pattern during the early hours of Friday, revealing signs of potential strain in this market.

However, Ethereum's performance has lagged behind Bitcoin, suggesting it may have some ground to cover.

In any case, the prevailing trend continues to draw enthusiastic buyers during dips, with Thursday's impressive surge standing out, particularly given Bitcoin's relative stability. The common driver behind this crypto ascent remains the trajectory of interest rates.

Remarkably, Ethereum managed to breach a formidable resistance barrier nestled near the $2100 level. This breakthrough has unlocked the prospect of ascending to loftier altitudes. Presently, Ethereum hovers just above the $2300 level, and it seems that short-term retracements will persistently present buying opportunities, with the $2100 level serving as a pivotal support zone. Of particular note, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average stands around the $1950 mark, an indicator closely scrutinized by many market participants.

On the horizon, Ethereum could potentially set its sights on the $2500 level, a significant milestone by virtue of its round, psychologically resonant value. The $2500 level would undoubtedly attract considerable attention and generate headlines. The overarching strategy in this landscape is the pursuit of value and the strategic exploitation of opportunities. Ethereum's long-term trajectory and its potential adoption as an everyday utility remain uncertain. However, Ethereum's role as the foundational platform for numerous other crypto projects continues to drive demand, as evidenced on multiple occasions in the past's Trajectory Amid Dollar Decline and Interest Rate Dynamics

In the broader context, the market will persist in its quest for value, capitalizing on the possibility that the US dollar may continue its decline. It's worth noting that a dramatic surge in interest rates could exert downward pressure not only on Ethereum but on the entire crypto spectrum. It's important to remember that cryptocurrencies represent a relatively high-risk asset class on the institutional investor spectrum. Consequently, the flow of capital will ebb, and flow based on fluctuations in the ""risk-free rate"" of bonds.

In the end, the breach of the $2100 resistance level has opened the door to higher price targets, while the $2500 level looms as a significant psychological threshold. Ethereum's role in the crypto ecosystem and its appeal to investors continue to shape its trajectory, closely intertwined with developments in interest rates. The crypto market remains an arena of volatility, where position sizing – and trend following will be paramount.

Over the weekend, Ethereum experienced a significant surge, indicating that the $2200 level, possibly extending down to the $2100 level, is now providing short-term support. This development suggests a growing inclination among investors to adopt a ""buy on the dips"" strategy, reflecting confidence in Ethereum's upward trajectory. The cryptocurrency has been consistently bullish, bolstered by expectations regarding the United States' monetary policy, which is a crucial factor influencing its value. Currently, traders are speculating that the Federal Reserve is going to start cutting rates in March.



Ethereum's growth is closely tied to the availability of inexpensive money and low interest rates in the United States. These economic conditions create an environment conducive to Ethereum's ascent.

Ethereum plays a foundational role in blockchain applications, although its broader utilization within blockchain technology is still evolving. The speculative nature of Ethereum is a key aspect of its appeal to investors, with the primary objective being the potential for profit.

Currently, the trajectory for making profits in the Ethereum market appears to be on the upside. A decisive break above the $2300 level could pave the way for Ethereum to reach the $2500 mark over time. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average is located at the lower boundary of Ethereum's recent consolidation zone, suggesting that it could provide a robust short-term foundation for the market. This level might also represent the base of the uptrend, especially if Ethereum faces significant selling pressure. This is going to be a potential buying opportunity, assuming you even get it. This is a market that will also follow Bitcoin as well – so pay attention to that market at the same time.

Overall, Ethereum's market dynamics are influenced by several factors, including global monetary policies, its role in blockchain technology, and its speculative nature. Investors are closely monitoring these aspects, as they are fundamental to Ethereum's value and its potential for future growth. The market sentiment is currently bullish, with key technical levels offering insights into potential support and resistance points. As Ethereum continues to evolve within the digital currency landscape, staying informed and adaptable will be vital for investors navigating this volatile and opportunity-rich market.

Cryptocurrency market capitalisation changed little at the end of trading on Wednesday, remaining close to $1.59 trillion (-0.14%

d/d). But this modest result is a show of strength, given the pressure in equity markets, which intensified selling in Bitcoin and Ether.

Meanwhile, Altcoins got their chance to catch up with the leaders. For example, XRP added 2% in 24h) and Cardano added 4%.

XRP has formed an upward trend since mid-October. An attempt to accelerate growth last month failed, but it also failed to break this line at the start of December. In addition to the trend line, the 50-day moving average, the touch of which stops the sell-off for the last 50 days, also turned out to be on the side of buyers.

Since the beginning of this year, the number of BTC addresses holding the cryptocurrency has increased by 20 per cent to more than 50 million, Santiment noted. BTC's growth is fuelled by the drop of its supply on exchanges to a six-year low.

Bitcoin has moved into the acceleration phase of the bull market, but the situation remains largely within its early stages, Glassnode noted. BTC's 142% YTD growth is consistent with the 2015-2017 and 2018-2022 cycles. Most bitcoin investors have entered the plus side, with several on-chain indicators moving into enthusiastic stage territory in an uptrend.

Coinbase crypto exchange CEO Brian Armstrong called bitcoin a great alternative to the US dollar and other fiat currencies. According to him, BTC can be an antidote to inflation.

The US SEC has asked the court to clarify whether the crypto assets sold by Terraform Labs are unregistered securities. The regulator strongly believes that these cryptocurrencies meet the criteria of securities.

With traditional finance out of reach, cryptocurrencies act as an alternative, especially in emerging markets and younger populations, the ECB study said.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the most successful meme cryptocurrency, is ten years old. It was created by programmer Billy Marcus and engineer Jackson Palmer as a parody of Bitcoin. DOGE has jumped 16% this week, hitting highs over the past year above $0.106.

The Ethereum market has undergone a rather impressive tumultuous ride in the past 24 hours, indicating a degree of cooling off in the market's fervor. This is something that I think was desperately needed and should be welcomed by the bullish traders out there.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get StartedETH Gets Sold Early

Ethereum bore the brunt of selling pressure during the early hours of Monday, effectively filling the gap from the previous week. The pivotal question now revolves around the resilience of the $2,100 level. At present, it appears reasonably likely that this level will hold, but lingering concerns loom over the broader future of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, these digital assets seem to be seeking a problem to solve, with their primary utility confined to trading. While certain smaller economies have found utility in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the overarching sentiment remains speculative, with the ever-present threat of central-bank digital currencies potentially overshadowing their existence.

Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies persist as tradable instruments, ensuring that market participants will continue to engage with them. The ultimate strength of this asset class remains uncertain, yet for the time being, there appears to be a noteworthy bullish undercurrent. All factors considered, this suggests that the market is poised to continue its ascent, albeit with the extent of further gains still shrouded in uncertainty. In the short term, an ascent to the $2,500 level seems plausible. However, it's vital to acknowledge that a reversal beneath the $1,900 mark could potentially signal the end of the prevailing uptrend. Nonetheless, Monday's trading session, marked by a market rebound, hints at the presence of a substantial buyer base.

It's essential to brace for the continued rollercoaster ride in this market, with an additional layer of volatility arising from the impending holiday season, which may see institutional funds exiting the market. Furthermore, vigilance is warranted regarding interest rate movements in the United States and other advanced economies such as the EU, as any signs of rate hikes could adversely affect the cryptocurrency landscape. In any case, it's reasonable to anticipate ongoing upward pressure in the market, notwithstanding some unforeseen noise or announcements out there. The central bank meeting this week could cause some issues, but at the same time, it should be noted that crypto is all about momentum and chasing most of the time, so that is something that you should keep in the back of your mind.

Ethereum experienced a modest dip during the early hours of Thursday, a development that, quite frankly, was long overdue.

Ethereum, in tandem with Bitcoin and numerous other cryptocurrencies, has undergone a remarkable surge in recent times. However, in the interest of fostering a healthy market, a revival of value is essential. The initial upward trajectory in the market has transitioned into a phase of consolidation or a mild pullback.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

Should consolidation be the path ahead, it is probable that we'll witness a period of sideways movement lasting several days. This period offers an opportune window for investors to identify favorable entry points. When a market experiences an abrupt ascent, it is prudent to exercise caution and avoid chasing trades. Alternatively, one might consider the potential for a substantial pullback, an occurrence that could provide substantial value. The $2100 level emerges as a point of interest in this context, as it carries a certain ""market memory"" due to its previous role as a significant resistance level. Consequently, one can reasonably anticipate robust support if Ethereum approaches this threshold Bottom?

Beneath this pivotal level lies the $1925 zone, which I regard as the termination point of the current trend. This level coincides with the presence of the 50-Day EMA and signifies a former area of substantial support. Only when Ethereum breaches this juncture would legitimate concerns regarding its market trajectory come into play. However, it is imperative to keep a vigilant eye on Bitcoin's performance before making any investment decisions, as Ethereum traditionally mirrors Bitcoin's movements. Despite the prevailing speculation suggesting Ethereum may need to catch up to Bitcoin, implying the potential for a more pronounced upward movement when the cryptocurrency market rallies again, I maintain a decidedly bullish outlook for Ethereum.

In essence, Ethereum's recent correction is not a sign of inherent weakness but rather a necessary step to establish a more sustainable foundation for future growth. The market's ability to attract fresh capital and maintain healthy price levels hinges on this process of consolidation or mild retracement. As cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and ever evolving, it is crucial for investors to navigate with prudence, strategically assessing entry points and heeding the broader context of the digital asset landscape. While volatility persists, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain promising, with the $2100 and $1925 levels serving as key waypoints to monitor in the journey forward.

Ethereum experienced a significant surge in its value during the early hours of Monday, spurred by the anticipation of the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates by the end of March.

This upward trend in Ethereum's market is largely attributed to traders' reactions to the fluctuating interest rates, with current market conditions indicating a halt in the Federal Reserve's rate hikes. This perceived pause in rate increases has led to an influx of ""hot money"" into cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.

The prospect of lower ""risk-free rates"" has made Ethereum an attractive option for traders seeking higher returns. Despite the appealing yields offered by bonds, there's a notable downward trend in bond yields, prompting investors to redirect their focus towards cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, in particular, is drawing attention due to its perceived stability and growth potential. The $2100 mark, previously a point of resistance, is now seen as a key support level. This shift in market dynamics, coupled with a sense of ""market memory,"" suggests that Ethereum is a valuable buy at current levels. Investors willing to take a calculated risk of around $250 per coin are likely to lean towards a bullish stance on Ethereum, given the current market trends.No Real Ethereum Sellers Out There

The reluctance to short Ethereum stems from the strong presence of buyers in the market and the anticipation of a continuous upward trend. A significant breach of trust would be indicated if Ethereum falls below the $1900 support level, potentially leading to a change in the overall market trend. However, as it stands, the dominance of buyers in the market makes any dip in Ethereum's value a potentially lucrative buying opportunity. Analysts believe that Ethereum has the potential to reach and surpass the $2500 threshold in the foreseeable future, highlighting its strong position in the cryptocurrency market.

This analysis reflects the current sentiment and trends in the cryptocurrency market, specifically focusing on Ethereum. The interplay between interest rates, market dynamics, and investor sentiment is crucial in understanding Ethereum's recent performance and its potential trajectory. The market's sensitivity to interest rate changes and the shifting balance between risk and return are key factors influencing Ethereum's value and appeal to investors.

During Wednesday's trading session, Ethereum exhibited fluctuating behavior, signaling a period of consolidation as the market heads into the latter half of the week.

This pattern comes after a notable breakout, suggesting that the market might be adjusting after recent gains. Additionally, Ethereum's movements are often influenced by Bitcoin, which is currently exhibiting a similar market stretch.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

A critical focus for Ethereum traders is the $2100 level, which previously acted as a resistance barrier and now may serve as a potential support level. The concept of ""market memory"" is particularly relevant here, as past resistance levels often transform into support in future market movements. While the general sentiment leans towards buying, finding value in the market is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

The anticipation is that Ethereum might eventually target the $2500 level. However, this progression requires careful market observation, particularly regarding the bond market. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have shown a heightened sensitivity to changes in interest rates, making the 10-year yield a significant factor to consider. Crypto investments require an influx of speculative capital, often referred to as ""hot money,"" to drive prices upward. This characteristic makes cryptocurrencies an investment on the extreme end of the financial spectrum – offering high potential returns but equally significant risks and the Death of Crypto Traders

Investors and traders in the crypto market need to approach with caution, particularly in terms of position sizing. The allure of quick gains can often lead to impulsive decisions, characterized by ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO) trades, which have been the downfall of many in the crypto space. Patience and identifying value are key strategies in navigating this volatile and unpredictable market.

Currently, the perceived ""floor"" of the market for Ethereum is around the $1925 level, which is the base of the previous consolidation area and coincides with the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average. This level might act as a critical juncture for determining Ethereum's future movements.

In the end, Ethereum's market is at a crossroads, influenced by its recent breakout, correlation with Bitcoin, bond market dynamics, and the broader economic environment. Investors are advised to stay vigilant, focusing on value and patience rather than succumbing to impulsive trading strategies.

Blockchain technologies have gained widespread use in security-sensitive applications due to their robust data protection. However, as blockchains are increasingly integrated into critical data management systems, they have become attractive targets for attackers. Among the various attacks on blockchain systems, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most significant and potentially devastating. These attacks render the systems incapable of processing transactions, causing the blockchain to come to a halt. To address the challenge of detecting DDoS attacks on blockchains, existing visualization schemes have been developed. However, these schemes often fail to provide early DDoS detection since they typically display only past and current system status. In this paper, we present a novel visualization scheme that not only portrays past and current values but also forecasts future expected system statuses. We achieve these future predictions by utilizing polynomial regression with blockchain data. Additionally, we offer an alternative DDoS detection method employing statistical analysis, specifically the coefficient of determination, to enhance accuracy. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme excels at predicting future blockchain statuses and anticipating DDoS attacks with minimal error. Our work empowers system managers of blockchain-based applications to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks at an earlier stage.


 










 


Recently, blockchain has become one of the essential data integrity solutions in many security-required applications [
1
,
2
]. These applications collect and manage data, which is safeguarded by blockchain-based security tools. In most cases, the data in such applications holds significant value, making financial or reputational damage a possibility in the event of a security breach. Therefore, while blockchain effectively preserves data integrity, additional security measures are necessary.
Within blockchain-based security systems, various types of attacks may emerge, including data leakage, theft of electronic wallets, and denial of service (DDoS) attacks. One common occurrence in these attacks is traffic flooding to the blockchain server, which can manifest not only during an attack but also before attacks commence. Attackers generate a large number of transactions to disrupt blockchain servers, resulting in massive traffic floods and gas consumption. Early detection is crucial in such scenarios, as identifying attack indicators in advance can minimize the extent of damage.
Several previous works have been developed to detect these types of attacks on blockchain-based systems. Most of these works involve measuring values related to attacks on blockchain systems [
3
]. For instance, Ji et al. measured the number of transactions to detect attacks on the Bitcoin network [
4
]. Similarly, Simon et al. proposed an intrusion detection system for the Ethereum network by analyzing mining rewards [
5
]. Additionally, various other previous works focus on detecting DDoS attacks on blockchain systems. However, these schemes merely present and anticipate values without visualizing the system's status, making them less accessible to non-IT experts, such as system managers.
To address this issue, several visualization schemes that display the status of blockchain systems have been proposed. Many monitoring tools with visualization features for blockchains are available, such as Etherscan [
6
] and Ethviewer [
7
]. Furthermore, visualization tools for healthcare data management systems based on Hyperledger [
7
] and Logchain [
8
] have been introduced. Some applications that display the connection information of blockchain nodes have also been developed [
9
,
10
]. Nevertheless, these previous visualization schemes assist in attack detection but do not allow system managers to recognize attack indicators in advance due to their lack of predictive capabilities [
11
].
In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization tool for blockchain systems that includes a prediction scheme. Like existing visualization schemes, our proposed tool primarily provides visualization features that depict the current system status. In our research, we focus on the Ethereum private network as the blockchain and measure values relevant to DDoS attacks on the blockchain system, including gas consumption and the number of transactions in each block. We specifically anticipate the future number of transactions in each block and identify DDoS attacks by comparing the expected data with the actual data. Additionally, we measure the gas usage for block generation and compare it to the average to determine the occurrence of DDoS attacks. We validate the accuracy of our tool using various statistical methods.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In 
Section 2
, we first discuss the relevant studies, and 
Section 3
 introduces the essential components of the proposed algorithms. 
Section 4
 provides a system model, and 
Section 5
 details our new visualization scheme. In 
Section 6
, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively detects DDoS attacks in the early stages. Finally, we conclude this paper in 
Section 7
.
In this section, we review previous works related to visualization schemes for blockchain.
While there are several security visualization schemes for general network systems, those specifically designed for blockchains have been relatively scarce. In the early stages, graph-based visualization schemes for cryptocurrency were proposed. Works such as [
12
,
13
,
14
] focused on data analysis and forensic investigation of transactions but did not consider security-related values. Tharani et al. [
9
] later proposed an advanced version that detects malicious transactions in Bitcoin, including ransomware and illicit advertisements. Similarly, refs. [
15
,
16
] presented visualization schemes for Ethereum, addressing fraud and vulnerability issues in transactions and smart contracts.
Another type of visualization scheme involves displaying network topologies. Delgado-Segura et al. introduced a technique for finding the Bitcoin network topology using orphan transactions [
17
], and Johnson et al. proposed a scheme that visualizes the mining pool and detects DDoS using a game-theoretic approach [
18
]. Miller et al. developed an advanced topology for the mining pool, highlighting influential nodes [
19
]. Additionally, Maeng et al. visualized the topology for the Ethereum network [
20
]. However, these visualization schemes primarily depict the current status without predicting future values.
Various monitoring tools exist for blockchain systems, such as [
21
,
22
]. In [
23
], the authors presented a monitoring system for Bitcoin that detects illegal proof-of-work blockchains. Chen et al. proposed a monitoring technology that detects Ponzi schemes on public blockchains. Additionally, monitoring tools for smart contracts in Ethereum were provided [
24
,
25
]. However, these tools lack a prediction scheme for fast attack detection.
Research on predicting the future status of blockchains has also been conducted. Zheng et al. defined metrics for measuring the current status of the blockchain [
3
], and Ji et al. proposed predicting the number of transactions in the blockchain based on machine learning [
4
]. Simon et al. anticipated mining rewards using polynomial regression for Ethereum. However, they did not consider time in predicting future values, possibly because the studied blockchains were public [
5
].
Blockchain is a chain of blocks that allows for the secure storage of all committed transactions using shared and distributed networks [
26
,
27
]. To achieve this, decentralization techniques and robust cryptographic schemes are employed. These measures guarantee the integrity of the data within the blockchain, ensuring that data cannot be tampered with illegally. Blockchain is characterized by four key concepts: Decentralization, Persistency, Anonymity, and Auditability [
27
,
28
].
Decentralization is a critical feature that safeguards data within the blockchain system. In traditional security schemes, important data are often managed in a centralized manner, where data are stored in a central database, and keys for encryption/decryption and digital signatures are generated by a central server. Additionally, security policies and key management methods are determined by the server, and users obtain keys from the server and must adhere to its rules.
However, centralized systems have inherent problems, including a single point of failure and concentration of power:
Single point of failure: In centralized security systems, essential information, including security-required data and keys, is stored on a central server. If an attacker breaches the central server and gains control, they can illegally access and modify the stored data. Furthermore, an attack on the central server can lead to a complete system shutdown. Consequently, the central server becomes a prime target for attackers, and real-world security breaches on central servers are well-documented.
Concentration of power: In most security systems, the central server has administrator authority. Therefore, the system manager possesses unrestricted access to data, enabling them to view and modify data as they see fit. Even without malicious intent, if the central server is compromised, all data on the server is at risk. These issues arise because administrative power is concentrated solely within the central server.
To address these limitations of traditional security systems, blockchain technology has been proposed. Blockchain ensures the perfect integrity of stored data through decentralization and robust cryptographic measures. Due to these properties, blockchain is now widely employed in systems where data integrity is paramount.
In a blockchain-based security system, data are stored in a decentralized manner across multiple nodes (assuming there are 
n
 nodes) instead of relying on a single server. This means that even if a user managing one node attempts to illegitimately alter data, the integrity of the data remains intact because the data on the other 




n


−


1




 nodes remain unaltered. For an attacker to modify blockchain data, more than half of the 
n
 nodes must be compromised. As the number of nodes grows and they are distributed globally, it becomes increasingly challenging for attackers to compromise more than half of the nodes.
However, the blockchain system must also ensure data integrity even when the number of nodes is small. To achieve this, an additional security measure is employed: the consensus algorithm. In blockchain systems, data or their hash values are stored within each block. To prevent illegal modifications, each block must be linked to the blockchain using a predetermined algorithm known as the consensus algorithm. Various consensus algorithms exist, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Connecting blocks with the consensus algorithm is often a complex process. Thus, if an attacker attempts to modify data within the blockchain, they must regenerate blocks from the point of data modification to the end block using the challenging consensus algorithm. This task is nearly impossible, ensuring the perfect integrity of the data.
The three fundamental elements of security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As previously mentioned, blockchain effectively ensures the integrity of stored data. Furthermore, in most blockchain-based systems, additional encryption and key management schemes are implemented to enhance confidentiality. Consequently, most attacks on blockchain systems aim to disrupt availability, typically through Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
In the context of blockchain, the most common method for launching a DDoS attack involves flooding the network with transactions. Legitimate users generate normal transactions to input data into each block or send cryptocurrency to other users. However, in a DDoS attack, spam or fake transactions are sent to the blockchain server, leading to the rejection of normal transactions or even a system shutdown.
Several examples of DDoS attacks on blockchain systems have been documented. A DDoS attack on the Solana blockchain occurred for 17 h in December 2021 [
29
], and another attack took place in January 2022 [
30
]. Multiple attacks on the Ethereum blockchain have also been reported [
31
,
32
]. 
Table 1
 presents well-known examples of DDoS attacks on blockchain systems.
Numerous solutions exist to prevent or mitigate DDoS attacks on blockchain systems. These solutions can be categorized into proactive and reactive methods. Proactive methods include retaining sufficient storage, memory, and network bandwidth, among other strategies. Reactive methods aim to mitigate DDoS attacks after they occur. Within the realm of reactive solutions, visualization tools that display the blockchain server's status have been developed to detect attacks earlier. However, existing visualization tools only reveal the current state of the blockchain, which may not be sufficient for rapid DDoS response.

At $9.4 trillion in assets under management, U.S. investment behemoth BlackRock Inc. (ticker: BLK) is the largest money manager in the world.

Just about all of that money percolates in traditional financial market channels, like stock, bonds, funds, currencies, derivatives, real estate and commodities. For years, nary a word was spoken (to the masses, at least) about BlackRock steering mountains of cash into cryptocurrencies.

[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]

But if you look closely, hints have been dropped about the investment firm's rising interest in crypto in the past few years.

A case in point: In November 2020, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said Bitcoin had the potential to 'take the place of gold to a large extent.' BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also weighed in on crypto, noting that original crypto Bitcoin (BTC) was resonating with the public and may one day create its own global market. In December 2020, BlackRock left another crypto clue, advertising for a vice president of blockchain who would ostensibly drive 'strategies designed to drive demand for the firm's offerings.'

BlackRock's Bid for a Spot Ethereum ETF

BlackRock announced in November 2023 that it filed for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund, and with that action the company's cryptocurrency vision has begun to crystalize. After all, it wouldn't roll out a new crypto ETF if it didn't believe in the market where it operates, would it?

BlackRock is not the only horse in the race for the first spot Ethereum ETF, however. Asset manager Grayscale Investments, which recently won a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to move a spot Bitcoin ETF into fruition, is also pursuing a spot Ethereum ETF. On Dec. 5, the SEC gave itself an extension to reach a decision or extend the deadline for the ETH ETF until January 2024.

BlackRock filed for its iShares Ethereum Trust to be listed on the Nasdaq and proposes to turn it into a spot ETF. Days later, Fidelity put in its own application for a spot Ethereum ETF, and at least five other top investment houses are now also in the running.

The SEC has yet to give the nod to either a spot Bitcoin or a spot Ethereum ETF, which would directly own Bitcoin and Ether rather than futures tied to the cryptos. There are several popular ETFs already in existence linked to cryptocurrency futures.

Spot Bitcoin ETF Appears Poised for Approval

BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF application is also in the works, as are talks between the SEC, Grayscale, Fidelity and others that have filed spot Bitcoin ETFs and progressed into a discussion of technical details, an indication that they may soon be approved, according to a Dec. 7 Reuters report.

What's not as clear is what these high-profile entries into the market mean for cryptocurrency investors, prices, and public policy risk and regulation oversight.

Industry investment experts say that it should mean a shot in the arm for crypto in the short term — and maybe a lot more.

'Companies like BlackRock recognize the potential for market growth and the opportunity to profit from it,' says Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payments platform Mercuryo. 'Consequently, they aim to be the first to penetrate the market and secure an advantage. Moreover, they already possess the necessary infrastructure, funds and investors to succeed and influence the further development of the crypto industry, given their heavy weight in the financial industry.'

Even more significantly, BlackRock's Ethereum ETF move could be seen as a new phase in the crypto industry's evolution. 'Large institutional investment funds are entering the market, prepared to invest their clients' money and influence the market's direction,' Berker says.

'The foray of institutional giants like BlackRock into the crypto market signifies the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies as an asset class,' says Nic Puckrin, CEO and co-founder of Coin Bureau, a cryptocurrency education platform. 'This strategic interest from large capital allocators signals a positive endorsement of the crypto industry, highlighting its growing acceptance and recognizing its potential for traditional hedge funds and investors.'

How Would a Spot Ethereum ETF Impact Markets?

Who benefits the most and who absorbs the largest risk regarding BlackRock's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF? While nothing is guaranteed in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market, here's an 'impact' list:

Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market

Crypto industry experts say BlackRock's potential introduction of a spot Ethereum ETF should drive the market forward significantly. BlackRock and Fidelity applying for spot crypto ETFs, as opposed to crypto futures ETFs, sends a message to the financial world that cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle have matured to the point that established institutions feel comfortable diving in.

If a BlackRock or Fidelity spot crypto ETF rolls out, the floodgates could open, allowing billions of dollars of new capital to have access to this uncorrelated asset class. So, in short, prices could go up.

Effect on Cryptocurrency Risk

While it's no secret that cryptocurrency is volatile, having the BlackRock brand and other big names in the crypto market should provide some price stability, experts say, as the relatively small pool of crypto owners expands to give access to more people.

In the case of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, for example, Galaxy Research estimates that the addressable market size would be roughly $14 trillion in the first year after its launch, reaching $39 trillion by its third year. That's a lot more crypto investors having a much bigger hand in the direction of assets.

Impact on Cryptocurrency Prices

Crypto experts generally view the BlackRock ETF play as a positive one across the board, price-wise.

'We can expect major cryptocurrency prices to spike in the short term,' says Habeeb Syed, an associate attorney at Sutter Law PC, which regularly services blockchain clients. 'Medium to long term, expect sustained increases in BTC and ETH with the normal consequential rises in other crypto as the market sees an influx of value based on the two major cryptocurrencies.'

That rise has already started, as Bitcoin's price popped above $44,000 late last week, and retreated just below $42,000 as of the morning of Dec. 11.

Other professional cryptocurrency trackers concur, noting the 'trust' issue leans toward the market with a BlackRock presence.

'Although we don't like to speculate on price action, we do believe that the crypto ETFs will have a positive impact on the industry and market overall,' says Nathan Leung, a crypto educator and lead content creator at Cryptonauts, a YouTube platform that covers blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

A stable level of trust from retail investors is extremely important because they are the key to mass adoption, Leung notes.

'Everyone has heard of crypto at this point, including your aunt and grandmother at family gatherings,' he says. 'But their perception of crypto varies, and the sentiment is mostly negative surrounding our industry. An ETF approval would boost the level of trust immensely, having a domino effect on the rest of the market.'

What Risk Is BlackRock Taking With a Spot Ethereum ETF?

The biggest risk BlackRock faces is their ETF investors thinking they can stomach a 50% drawdown but then getting squeamish and pulling out at the bottom, causing negative sentiment toward BlackRock and the asset class as a whole, experts say.

However, BlackRock entering the fold may mark a level of maturity for the industry, limiting future drawdowns to normal percentages akin to real estate investment trusts and small-cap stocks.

What a Spot Ethereum ETF Means for the Second-Largest Crypto

Often languishing in the shadow of Bitcoin, Ethereum could find its time to shine, but there are caveats.

'Ethereum is just the next big thing after Bitcoin and one of the assets in the space least likely to be classified as a security given its decentralized nature and active and widespread use,' Syed says. 'If you're putting in the time and money to start an ETF, you don't want those efforts wiped out by a surprise SEC ruling.'

Yet, with a green light from regulators, Ethereum could significantly benefit from its Fidelity or BlackRock ETF connection.

'Ethereum, the second-largest and most widely recognized cryptocurrency following Bitcoin, presents a valuable platform for BlackRock to enter this market,' Berker says. 'Beyond its recognition, Ethereum provides substantial liquidity.'

That means investment funds can purchase Ether in advance to establish a liquid reserve. 'When they decide to act, this reserve guarantees a robust market for transactions, offering an advantage over other altcoins,' Berker notes.

Impact of Spot Crypto ETFs on Everyday Investors

Big moves from big investment firms have a ripple effect on Main Street investors, and BlackRock's new Ethereum ETF should be no different.

As with any investment, retail investors should keep a cool head if a spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF goes live. 'While the news about ETF approval will positively affect the development of the crypto market, it is also vital to consider the progression and continuity of such news,' Berker says.

Many investors will understandably assume that after a spot ETF has been approved, the price will be going up. But that's not necessarily the case.

'If there isn't any additional news to stimulate the market subsequently, there will be no reason for prices to continue increasing,' Berker adds. 'In general, market movement revolves around the noise generated by the news that every investor absorbs. Consequently, the market will need more such news in the future, to keep the price momentum going.'

It is believed this is the first time such materials and techniques have been used.

3D printing is advancing rapidly, and the range of materials that can be used has expanded considerably. While the technology was previously limited to fast-​curing plastics, it has now been made suitable for slow-​curing plastics as well.

These have decisive advantages as they have enhanced elastic properties and are more durable and robust.

The use of such polymers is made possible by a new technology developed by researchers at ETH Zurich and a US start-​up. As a result, researchers can now 3D print complex, more durable robots from a variety of high-​quality materials in one go.

This new technology also makes it easy to combine soft, elastic, and rigid materials. The researchers can also use it to create delicate structures and parts with cavities as desired.

Ethereum has been on a roll lately, and it's not just a fluke.

The reason behind this rally is the growing speculation around central bank policies worldwide. You might wonder how these bank policies are connected to a digital currency like Ethereum, but the answer is simple. When central banks make big decisions, it affects the entire financial world, and Ethereum is part of that world.

So, what's the deal with Ethereum's recent price surge? Well, it's all about risk appetite. When people are feeling bold and ready to take risks, they tend to invest in assets like Ethereum. It's like a rollercoaster ride for investors, and Ethereum is one of the exciting markets when it comes to momentum and risk appetite aspects.

But here's the catch: even rollercoasters have their ups and downs. Ethereum is no different. We can expect a short-term pullback in its price. Think of it as a small dip in the rollercoaster ride. However, this dip can be a golden opportunity for smart investors. If Ethereum's price gets close to $2100, many buyers will swoop in to grab some ""cheap Ethereum.""Next Target: $2500

Now, let's look at the next target: $2500. This is the level that Ethereum enthusiasts are eyeing in the short term. If Ethereum manages to break above this level, we could see it go even higher. But breaking that barrier won't be a piece of cake; it's like reaching the summit of a challenging mountain. Nevertheless, it's not impossible, and Ethereum could conquer it eventually.

In this journey, we must keep an eye on the $2050 level, which is where the 50-Day Exponential Moving Averag sits. If Ethereum drops below this level, it could spell trouble. We'd have to rethink our whole strategy. However, the chances of that happening in the near future seem slim. So, for now, it's best to see this as a ""buy on the dips"" opportunity.

But Ethereum isn't alone in this crypto adventure. Bitcoin, often considered the leader of the crypto pack, can influence the entire crypto world. So, if you plan to trade Ethereum, keep a watchful eye on the Bitcoin market as well. The two are closely connected, and what happens in one can affect the other.

Ultimately, Ethereum's recent rally is tied to the global speculation surrounding central bank policies. While we can expect some short-term ups and downs, Ethereum has the potential to reach new heights. Keep an eye on key levels, pay attention to Bitcoin, and stay aware of the US Dollar's influence.

Ethereum showed signs of an upward trend early in the trading session on Tuesday. The market remains active with a lot of fluctuations.

However, there's noticeable support around the $2100 level, which has been a significant point multiple time before.

This level used to be a tough barrier when the market was climbing, acting like a ceiling that Ethereum struggled to break through. If Ethereum's price drops a bit, this $2100 level might provide some support again, but even if it falls below this, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average could offer even stronger support. It's a good idea to keep an eye on this area.

Looking upwards, the market is eyeing the $2500 mark as a potential goal, and many traders are likely trying to steer Ethereum towards this target. If it surpasses that, the next level to watch might be around $2700. In essence, it seems like traders are always ready to buy Ethereum when its price dips, believing they're getting good value, and this trend is likely to continue 50-Day EMA

However, if Ethereum's value drops below the 50-Day EMA , it could signal a more significant downturn. Another critical factor to consider is the influence of interest rates, particularly in the United States and other major bond markets. If these rates start to increase, it could put pressure on the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to a decrease in prices, not just for Ethereum but for other digital currencies as well.

Overall, the expectation is that Ethereum's value will rise in the long run. It's also important to watch Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, as its movements often influence the rest of the crypto market. As things stand, there seems to be a strong interest in cryptocurrencies continuing into 2024, with many people willing to invest in them. This is the thesis for most crypto markets, and I think Ethereum will not be any different. At this point, there seems to be a lot of interest in accumulating ETH in wallets, as the entire cryptocurrency industry seems to be posed to see a lot of institutional inflows. However, are we ever going to get that'must have use' for crypto in general? This has always been the real question. In the meantime, its about speculation in this market, and all other crypto markets

Ethereum's Friday session saw an attempt at a rally followed by a retracement, reflecting the prevailing noisy behavior in the market. The intricate dynamics of Ethereum are influenced by various factors, including interest rates and economic indicators, both of which are in a majorly noisy environment at the moment.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

Traders are closely monitoring interest rates, as they play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum's performance. Additionally, concerns emerged from the Empire State Manufacturing numbers, hinting at growing unease about the possibility of an impending recession.

However, as the year-end approaches, Wall Street remains focused on seeking returns, which could translate into continued interest in cryptocurrencies as an investment option, to'chase performance.'Support Below

A significant support level lies at $2,100, which was previously a substantial resistance level. This level continues to attract buyers who see Ethereum as a valuable asset, especially with the year-end boost in the crypto market in mind.

On the upside, the $2,350 level may act as a barrier, causing some hesitation in Ethereum's ascent. Should this level be breached, the $2,500 mark becomes the next target. This would be the bullish scenario that I think a lot of people are counting on.

In the current market environment, there is little rationale to consider selling Ethereu . Profit-taking is a natural occurrence and may be expected in the vicinity of current prices. The prudent approach is to consider a ""buy on the dip"" strategy, but with a measure of caution not to become overly aggressive. The market's direction is clear, and Ethereum appears poised for further gains.

Consequently, selling Ethereum does not appear to be a favorable option at this juncture. Instead, traders may want to keep a watchful eye on the $2,100 support level, viewing any potential dip as an opportunity. Whether Ethereum experiences a drop or continues its ascent, there are prospects for traders who remain attentive and exercise caution in their approach.

At the end of the day, Ethereum's market landscape is characterized by volatility and sensitivity to economic indicators. Interest rates and economic concerns are currently driving market sentiment. While profit-taking is anticipated, the overall trend remains bullish, favoring a ""buy on the dip"" strategy. Ethereum's path toward the $2,500 level seems plausible, and traders should remain vigilant for potential opportunities, particularly around the $2,100 support level.

The bank attributes this expected outperformance to an upcoming network upgrade for Ethereum, set to enhance its blockchain system's scalability and transaction speed.



While expressing optimism about Ethereum's future prospects, JP Morgan exercised caution regarding the broader cryptocurrency market in the coming year. The bank cited potential challenges, including the anticipated approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), concerns about speculative buying, and trading patterns influenced by speculation.



JP Morgan's analysts cautioned that the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs might not lead to substantial gains. They highlighted the likelihood of trading patterns characterized by buying during rumor spread periods and selling upon the occurrence of expected events. This behavior is expected to manifest once US regulators approve the launch of the funds, a decision expected early next year.



The report noted that the current weak demand for Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada serves as evidence that the introduction of this new investment tool in the United States may not garner significant momentum. As a result, these funds might withdraw capital from existing investment products tied to Bitcoin, potentially redirecting capital rather than attracting new investments.

Ethereum price rallied by over 85% in 2023 – a similar increase in 2024 places the target above $4,000.

Spot Bitcoin ETF approval will be a key catalyst for a price rally and also set a precedent for ETH ETF approvals in Q2 and Q3 2024.

Ethereum mainnet is expected to undergo the sharding upgrades, starting with Dencun, which will introduce proto-danksharding.

Investors and traders alike are anticipating ETH price to rise in order to book profits before Q2 2024.

Ethereum price increased considerably in 2023, recovering about a third of the crash from December 2021 to May 2022. However, the remaining two-thirds of this crash is expected to be recovered in 2024 owing to multiple factors.

ETH investors have a lot to look forward to throughout the year as events such as spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Dencun (sharding) update, and spot Ethereum ETF decision will be taking place, which are expected to be bullish catalysts. However, the lack of institutional investors' interest might act as a barrier to this growth and keep ETH from reaching $4,000.

2024 Fundamental outlook: Ethereum price to witness growth from spot Bitcoin ETF approval

2024 is expected to kick off the bull run that the crypto market has been waiting for since June 2022. Ethereum price, along with the rest of the market, is set to witness bullishness owing to one single factor – the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Over a dozen investment fund managers, including the likes of BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, have applied for ETFs. The initial outcome was not positive as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exhibited skepticism, but following Grayscale's win, sentiment changed.

The court ruled in favor of the asset manager in the lawsuit filed against the SEC for rejecting the request to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. This imbued confidence in the market, and the deadline for the final decision is expected to arrive by January 10, 2024.

Bitcoin spot ETF update

As Bitcoin price rallies, Ethereum will fulfill its role as the ""Silver to BTC's Gold"" and likely push other altcoins to rally as well.

Furthermore, this approval will also set a precedent for Ethereum spot ETFs, which asset managers are already eyeing. VanEck, ARK Invest, and BlackRock, among three others, have already applied for a spot ETH ETF. Grayscale, too, filed to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these applications have strong odds of approval, too, since they would be similar in design and structure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, their final deadline is between May and August 2024, giving investors time before they can get their hands on the investment products.

Ethereum spot ETF filings

That said, following the spot BTC ETF approval, ETH ETFs will see much less friction in acquiring a green light from the SEC. This will be the driving factor for the continuation of the Ethereum price rise in Q2 2024.

The Surge after the Merge

During a recent Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the future of the blockchain. Referencing the Merge, Buterin stated that the chain is only 55% complete and has a long way to go.

The next four stages, as noted by Buterin, will be The Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The first of these four – The Surge – will introduce sharding on Ethereum.

Sharding is a key scalability solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network's capacity to process transactions and execute smart contracts. This is done by splitting the network into smaller, more manageable chains called shards.

Ethereum Sharding structure

These shards are individual components of the Ethereum network itself. Each shard operates as an independent blockchain with its own set of smart contracts. These chains can process transactions and execute smart contracts independently, reducing congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.

The main goals of Ethereum developers with the sharding update are as follows:

Scalability: As the Ethereum network continues to grow, it faces significant limitations in transaction throughput and processing capacity. Sharding introduces a parallel processing approach, allowing multiple transactions and smart contracts to be processed simultaneously across different shards. Crosslinking: Shards communicate with each other through crosslinks, which are references to the state of one shard included in another shard's block. Crosslinking helps maintain consistency and integrity across the entire Ethereum network. Increased opportunities for validators: Validators participate in the consensus process by proposing and validating blocks on individual shards. Validators are chosen to propose blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they lock up as collateral in the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake system.

In the sharding update, the beacon chain will play a crucial role as well. The beacon chain was the first Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which acts as a separate blockchain that coordinates the overall network and manages the consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Stake). This chain will be used to coordinate communication between the shards.

The process of implementing sharding will begin with the Dencun upgrade. Set to be executed in Q1 2024, the upgrade will bring proto-danksharding to the network. Proto-danksharding will act as the scaffolding for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding, which is a crucial part of the Surge.

Dencun upgrade will also optimize the Ethereum gas fees, which has been a prevailing issue for users. Throughout 2023, Ethereum layer-2 chain's fee per transaction has averaged $0.02 to $0.21, whereas Ethereum mainnet transaction fees have averaged $4.86.

Ethereum and layer-2 chains' gas fees

As these updates are set to arrive in Q1 and Q2, with many of them expected to be deployed by May-June, they will likely act as the bullish catalyst of the second half of 2024.

2024 Technical Outlook: Ethereum price could see $4,000

Ethereum price over the past year had a good run, rising by more than 85%. While Q1 proved to be a good quarter for the altcoin, the growth halted, and ETH largely consolidated throughout Q2 and Q3, struggling to breach the $2,000 mark.

However, in Q4, Ethereum price began rallying again, mostly owing to expectations surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which also led to many investment funds filing for spot ETH ETFs. During this duration, ETH shot up by 51% to end the year at around $2,200, which is the present trading price.

Thus, if throughout 2023 ETH rose by over 85% despite the bearish market conditions, a similar rally or even a larger one can be expected out of a bullish year in which ETF approvals are expected, network developments are implemented, and Bitcoin halving will take place.

ETH/USD 1-week chart

If ETH repeats 2023's performance in 2024, the target for next year will be at over $4,000. The price indicators also suggest a bullish outcome despite the slight correction in the past few weeks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just exited overbought, coinciding with the pullback witnessed over the last week, whilst the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the zero line, showing the uptrend is accompanied by strong bullish momentum.

Although the receding green bars do suggest that the bullishness is waning at the moment, some pullback before bullish momentum regains strength is common in longer timeframes, and this can be observed during the past bull runs as well.

Furthermore, ETH has observed the 50, 100 and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) as support, which is a bullish indication since the last time this happened was in July 2020. At that time, ETH ended up scoring a 1,577% rally from $288 to $3,928, a feat that will not be replicated in 2024.

Nevertheless, despite the bullish indications, one should remember that the recent rally has caused the Ethereum price to be overbought on RSI, and investors might attempt to book profits in the first half of 2024 again. This falls in line with historical movement where ETH lived in the overbought zone (RSI above 70.0) for about six months before initiating short-term corrections in June 2021.

Ethereum RSI and MACD

The prospect of investors selling their holdings to realize profits is also evident from the on-chain metrics, which suggest investors may book profits if the Ethereum price shoots up. Nevertheless, ETH would still be expected to remain above the $2,500 mark until Q2, after the corrections, the ETF hype subsides, and the market moves on to the Ethereum network upgrades.

Profit-taking will bring corrections, but traders remain bullish

On-chain metrics can be used to analyze investors' behavior and make predictions about future price activity. One of the most important on-chain metrics is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric is an indicator used to assess the average profit/loss of investors who purchase an asset. It can provide clues as to when investors might begin taking profits and selling their holdings, leading to pullbacks in price.

The quarterly and yearly MVRV ratios are the most useful for long-term analysis. The 90-day MVRV ratio measures the average profit/loss of investors who purchased an asset in the past three months, and the 365-day MVRV ratio measures the same over the last year.

For Ethereum, the 90-day MVRV sits at 15.25%, which indicates that investors who purchased ETH in Q4 2023 are sitting at 15.25% profit. Similarly, the 365-day MVRV ratio is presently at 24.18%, suggesting that those who purchased throughout 2023 are, on average, witnessing 24.18% profits.

Interestingly, considering both the timeframes, it is evident that these investors are likely to be tempted to sell their holdings soon to realize profits. This could most certainly trigger a sell-off. As seen in the chart, when MVRV hits 9% to 34% on the yearly time frame and 7.8% to 31% on the quarterly time frame, ETH has undergone considerable corrections. Hence, this area is termed a danger zone.

Ethereum MVRV ratio

Apart from investors, the traders are also seemingly bullish. This inference is derived from the funding rates, which show an increasing trend. Such a trend suggests that long positions are gaining dominance, indicating a prevailing bullish market sentiment.

As can be observed on the chart below, the last time funding rates plunged into negative, i.e., short traders gained dominance, was back in March 2023. Since then, the rates have largely been positive, which means people are betting on a rise. This is solely being done with the intention of selling for profits.

Ethereum funding rate

So, considering these conditions, the bull run that starts due to spot Bitcoin ETF hype, followed by the sharding update, will likely urge investors to sell and realize profits. However, long-term holders will refrain and wait until the bull run flips and ETH begins witnessing a downtrend.

Watch out for institutions

One key factor that might act as a headwind to Ethereum price reaching the target of $4,000 is the lack of institutional interest ETH has been witnessing. Year to date, the crypto asset only managed to rake in $19 million, which is far lower than Solana's $146 million worth of inflows and astronomically less than Bitcoin's $1.7 billion.

Ethereum's year-to-date institutional flows

If this trend continues in 2024 as well, ETH might struggle to capitalize on the rest of the bullish cues since institutions are expected to drive the next bull run, and lack of interest from them may not play in Ethereum's favor.

Summary

To summarize the outlook for Ethereum in 2024, the best advice is to sit on holdings, wait and gain. A bullish year for the broader crypto market and a bullish year for ETH investors is the forecast. But that does not mean the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold is completely immune to bearish outcomes.

While an increase to $4,000 is possible, it is not a certainty since regulatory changes and unprecedented crashes plague the crypto market. Furthermore, considering the performance in 2023, ETH has not necessarily been the favorite asset of institutional investors. This lack of interest, if noted in 2024 as well, could act as an opposing force on ETH's potential growth.

Thus, it is advised always to do your own research and make the most ETH-ducated decision.",fxstreet.com,7502,news,ES,en,,https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Ethereum/ethereum_2_Large.jpg,False,@FXStreetUpdate,8.37756,7c373741ddfe309b4cca9a8f41b7fd73

According to'DeFi Universe Data Center' #DefiLlama, the trading volume on Solana's #DEX has now exceeded that of #Web3 infrastructure leader #Ethereum.





At one point, Solana captured $1.475 billion in DEX trading volume within 24 hours, which is about 4 times the DEX TVL on Solana, surpassing Ethereum's DEX trading volume of approximately $1.164 billion.

Ethereum experienced a downturn in the early hours of Tuesday, further underscoring the prevailing volatility in this market.

In the grander scheme of things, Ethereum appears poised to gain more momentum. However, the current situation can be attributed to the rapid ascent it recently enjoyed, combined with the fact that we are navigating the period between Christmas and New Year's Day, a time when market liquidity tends to dwindle.

A crucial level to watch is the $2100 mark, which should serve as a significant support zone. This level has not only provided support in the past but has also demonstrated resistance to buying pressure. Market participants are likely to bear in mind this historical significance, potentially presenting an attractive opportunity for value-oriented investors. On the upside, the $2500 level looms large, and a successful breach of this level could pave the way for a move toward the $3000 mark. Over the longer term, there is potential for Ethereum to reach the $3500 level. However, the immediate future is likely to be marked by choppy, back-and-forth price movements.

In terms of strategy, a prudent approach would involve buying the dips, but doing so incrementally rather than diving headfirst into the market. The next few sessions could be characterized by unusual price movements, making it essential to exercise caution. Nevertheless, Ethereum appears to have a bullish outlook in the long run, especially as interest rates in the United States continue to decline. This decline in interest rates has historically been favorable for the broader cryptocurrency market. As traders become more willing to embrace risk , Ethereum stands to benefit. Ethereum holds a unique position within the market as the foundation for numerous tokens and ecosystems built upon its platform. For Ethereum to thrive, there must be a willingness among investors to engage with the crypto markets and their associated ecosystems, a trend that seems poised to gain momentum in 2024.

As Ethereum charts its course into 2024, investors and traders should remain vigilant, closely monitoring key support and resistance levels underneath, and adopting a measured approach to capitalize on potential opportunities in this market, as the buyers will be under current levels to continue to lift ETH to higher levels, as the'cheap money' coming from the Federal Reserve will continue to be a major influence on not only the Ethereum market but also other cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum displayed a modest rally during Thursday's trading session, indicating a readiness to attract more buyers in the future.

Ethereum has been facing some pressure due to the prevailing lower interest rates, a trend that is likely to persist. In essence, money is searching for outlets where it can gain momentum, and the cryptocurrency sector is positioned relatively high on the risk spectrum. Hence, it makes sense for individuals to explore this alternative investment avenue.

However, there are some key considerations to bear in mind in the coming days. The holiday season tends to deplete liquidity from the market, particularly concerning institutional participation. During this period, retail trading is likely to dominate. This doesn't imply that retail traders cannot influence the Ethereum market, but it does mean that a portion of the market's liquidity will be reduced. Consequently, we may witness some erratic price movements. For those with a longer-term trading perspective, the approach may involve entering the market and enduring the volatility. Overall, it's reasonable to anticipate ongoing buying interest in Ethereum, with the $2,100 level serving as a substantial support zone the Upside...

On the upside, the $2,500 level is a notable short-term resistance barrier. If Ethereum manages to breach this level, it could potentially rally toward the $2,700 level. However, it's important to recognize that the next couple of weeks may present some challenges. Consequently, exercising caution in terms of position sizing is advisable. Nevertheless, considering that the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average is positioned just above the $2,000 level, it adds another layer of support beneath. As long as the interest rate scenario in the United States continues to decline, it's likely that the market will eventually attract buyers seeking to capitalize on the momentum and the favorable conditions for relatively easy gains.

At the end of the day, Ethereum appears poised to continue attracting buyers, although some challenges may arise in the coming weeks due to the holiday season. Position sizing should be approached cautiously, and the market's resilience should be recognized, with the 50-day EMA reinforcing support. The declining interest rates in the United States are expected to drive further interest in this market, creating opportunities for those seeking momentum and potential easy profits.
