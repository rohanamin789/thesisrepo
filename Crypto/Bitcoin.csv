In a 1 January Twitter post, Luke Dashjr alleged that the hacker had somehow gained access to his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Key. This is a widely-used security method that uses two keys to encrypt sensitive information.More than $3.6 million stolenDashjr posted a thread on Twitter where he mentioned the wallet address where his stolen BTC had been sent but did not talk about the amount of BTC that was stolen. 
PSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin
— @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023He also told a Twitter user in the thread that he got to know about the recent hack when he received emails from Coinbase and Kraken about suspicious login attempts.
According to a Cointelegraph report, the wallet address in question shows four transactions on 31 December with the total value amounting to $3.6 million, which is roughly 216.39 BTC.
In the thread, Dashjr mentioned that he had ""no idea"" how his account was compromised and how the hacker gained access to his security key. However, one of the users on Twitter pointed out a possible connection with an earlier Twitter post by Dashjr on 17 November where he mentioned that his server had been compromised by ""new malware/backdoors on the system"".
PSA: My server was accessed this morning by an unknown person. Full analysis in progress, but take extra care that you PGP-verified any downloads. #Bitcoin
— @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) November 17, 2022This incident has caught the eyes of some prominent figures in the crypto space, especially the CEO of Binance, CZ Zhao, who offered his support and condolences to Dashjr in a post. 'Sorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor. If it comes our way, we will freeze it. If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,"" he wrote.Some suggest foul playThough many have come in support of Dashjr, there are a few who have speculated that lex security was the reason the hack could be conducted successfully. A user on Reddit suggested that Dashjr may not have taken the earlier 17 November security breach ""seriously enough"" and later suggested that Dashjr might not have kept his Bitcoin on a more secure device, suggesting that ""he had a hot wallet on the same computer he did everything else.
Also, there are a few users who feel that Dashjr might have been complacent with his seed phrase or it could have been part of a ""boating accident"". A boating accident is basically a meme repurposed by the crypto community to cite when someone is trying to avoid paying taxes by claiming that his crypto assets have been stolen. Post the hack, many crypto influencers and even CZ Zhao have cautioned the crypto community regarding the self-custody of crypto.

(NYSE American: AULT), a diversified holding company ('Ault' or the 'Company'), today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, BitNile, Inc. ('BitNile') published an unaudited update on Bitcoin production and miner installation. The number of miners and production capacity metrics within this press release represent the S19j Pro and XP Antminers at the Michigan data center. BitNile's Bitcoin mining production is currently operating at an estimated annualized run rate of 1,484 Bitcoin based on current market conditions, including a mining difficulty of 34.09 trillion.



BitNile has 20,441 S19j Pro and XP Antminers in possession, which once installed and energized, will generate a combined processing power of approximately 2.21 exahashes per second ('EH/s'), the computational power that is being used to mine Bitcoin. During the month of December 2022, BitNile received 123.71 Bitcoin as a result of its miners providing computing power to a mining pool operator, and to date, BitNile has received a total of approximately 738 Bitcoin.

Milton 'Todd' Ault, III, the Company's Executive Chairman, stated, 'The team has continued to optimize our mining operation in Michigan, and as a result increased mining production from November to December by approximately 1 Bitcoin per day (92 to 123). I look forward to 2023, as we continue to diligence other potential opportunities for additional mining operations.'

As previously disclosed, the Company has entered into purchase agreements with Bitmain Technologies Limited for a total of 23,065 Bitcoin miners, including 4,600 environmentally friendly S19 XP Antminers that feature a processing power of 140 terahashes per second ('TH/s'), 17,325 S19j Pro Antminers that feature a processing power of 100 TH/s and 1,140 S19 XP Hydro Antminers that feature a processing power of 255 TH/s. Once all of the miners are fully deployed and operational, BitNile expects to achieve a mining production capacity of approximately 2.66 EH/s.

BitNile notes that all estimates and other projections are subject to the actual delivery and installation of Bitcoin miners, the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, the ability of Agora Digital Holdings Inc. to raise the required capital and to build out and provide the necessary power to its facility in Texas, with whom BitNile has contracted, and other factors that may impact the results of production or operations.

(TSX-V: CBIT; OTCQX: CBTTF) ('Cathedra' or the 'Company'), a Bitcoin company that develops and operate","January 12, 2023 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(Block Height: 771,530) – Cathedra Bitcoin Inc. (TSX-V: CBIT; OTCQX: CBTTF) ('Cathedra' or the 'Company'), a Bitcoin company that develops and operates world-class bitcoin mining infrastructure, is pleased to announce the following operations and corporate updates.



The Company has received an additional 1,385 Bitmain Antminer S19J Pro machines from its 2021 futures order, 920 of which are being installed at the Company's mine in Washington. The final 773 S19J Pros from the 2021 futures order are expected to be delivered in Q1 2023, as the Company elected to ship these machines via ocean freight rather than air freight to conserve cash. The Company continues to evaluate potential deployment opportunities for the remaining 1,238 S19J Pros to further increase its bitcoin mining hash rate.

In recent weeks, the Company has optimized its operations at two sites by 'underclocking' certain of its existing machines—reducing power draw to improve machine efficiency, as measured by energy consumed per unit of hash rate produced (joules per terahash, or J/TH). The Company performed these optimizations at its Washington mine and one of the data centers at which it hosts machines in Tennessee. The Company selected these two sites to maximize operating cash flow under current market conditions and expects to complete this optimization in the next week, after which it estimates the Washington site will produce 88 PH/s using 2.0 MW (vs. 52 PH/s from 2.0 MW previously) and the Tennessee data center will produce 24 PH/s using 0.6 MW (vs. 37 PH/s from 1.1 MW previously). Following these optimizations, the Company expects to realize average efficiency across these two sites of 23 J/TH, as opposed to 35 J/TH before the optimization, representing an improvement of approximately 36%. After these changes, the Company estimates its active bitcoin mining fleet will produce approximately 226 PH/s.

In December, the Company prepaid the full outstanding principal balance on its last equipment loan for a total of US$270,690. The equipment loan carried interest at 15% and was prepaid at par. This equipment loan was collateralized by 180 MicroBT Whatsminer M30S machines, which have been moved to storage to make room for the optimizations at the Washington mine.

Additionally, during December the Company entered into a series of agreements with various parties to sell certain credits and coupons which it had received from third-party vendors for cash. Under these credit and coupon sales, the Company has raised US$683,398 in cash proceeds since December 6, 2022, and expects to receive an additional US$937,605 in the coming weeks. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held C$3,227,000 (US$2,383,000) in cash and cash equivalents.

Finally, in accordance with its ongoing efforts to conserve cash, the Company has made further reductions to corporate salaries, now saving an estimated US$285,000 per year in payroll expenses. Additionally, the Company has reached an agreement with its board of directors to restructure the board's compensation plan. Under the restructured plan, the Company will reduce its total cash directors' fees by US$62,400 per year and in return grant its directors a total of 1,560,000 restricted share units under the Company's long-term incentive plan for the 2023 fiscal year. The restricted share units will vest one year following the date of the grant, being January 6, 2023.

Management Commentary

'In market conditions like these, one must think like a cockroach. After deploying these additional machines, improving the efficiency of some existing machines through underclocking, and further reducing our overhead, we will continue to generate positive EBITDA under current market conditions.'

The research purpose of this paper is to obtain an algorithm model with high prediction accuracy for the price of Bitcoin on the next day through random forest regression and LSTM, and to explain which variables have influence on the price of Bitcoin. There is much prior literature on Bitcoin price prediction research, and the research methods mainly revolve around the ARMA model of time series and the LSTM algorithm of deep learning. Although it cannot be proved by the Diebold–Mariano test that the prediction accuracy of random forest regression is significantly better than that of LSTM, the prediction errors RMSE and MAPE of random forest regression are better than those of LSTM. The changes in the variables that determine the price of Bitcoin in each period are also obtained through random forest regression. From 2015 to 2018, three US stock market indexes, NASDAQ, DJI, and S&P500 and oil price, and ETH price have impact on Bitcoin prices. Since 2018, the important variables have become ETH price and Japanese stock market index JP225. The relationship between accuracy and the number of periods of explanatory variables brought into the model shows that for predicting the price of Bitcoin for the next day, the model with only one lag of the explanatory variables has the best prediction accuracy.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography for security and is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It was created in 2008 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) with a paper titled 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Electronic Cash System'. Transactions with bitcoin are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which allows anyone to view the history of a specific Bitcoin. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows it to operate independently of central banks and can be transferred instantly across the globe. It has gained popularity as a means of exchange and a store of value (Baur and Dimpfl 2021). In the past 10 years, after experiencing several ups and downs, it broke through USD 68,000 per coin in November 2021, and the total current price once exceeded USD 1.2 trillion.However, as a commodity, Bitcoin has the problem of high volatility. During the seven years from April 2015 to April 2022, the standard deviation of Bitcoin's daily return rate was 3.85%, which was 2.68 times the standard deviation of gold's return rate during the same period and 3.36 times that of the S&P500. Due to the large price fluctuations, the function of Bitcoin as a store of value as a commodity and as a transaction payment function as a currency has been questioned.While enjoying the advantages of Bitcoin's security and decentralization, how to grasp the trend of Bitcoin to minimize the risk of Bitcoin floating has become a difficult problem. Many researchers try to grasp the trend of Bitcoin through the correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the price of other commodities. But whether it is gold (Baur and Hoang 2021; Kim et al. 2020b; Blake 2019), which is often used for comparison, stock market index (Erdas and Caglar 2018), or crude oil price (Selmi et al. 2018), past studies have shown that the correlation between Bitcoin and them is weak.In past studies, another type of research direction to grasp the price trend of Bitcoin is to predict the price of Bitcoin in the future through AI algorithms and powerful computing power of computers. With the improvement of hardware performance in the 21st century, machine learning technology which has become a hot field of research. Primarily, machine learning has been used across a variety of areas such as that of stock markets (Huang and Liu 2020; Philip 2020); crude oil markets (Fan et al. 2016); gold markets (Chen et al. 2020b); and futures markets (Kim et al. 2020a).Prediction of Bitcoin by AI is mainly divided into two categories. The first category is the classification research of predicting the rise or fall of Bitcoin in the future. The error standard is DA and F1. The other category is regression research on predicting Bitcoin prices, while the corresponding errors are RMSE and MAPE. Due to the sharp fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin, only grasping the rise or fall of the price of Bitcoin in the future cannot help investors avoid risks. In contrast, getting the specific bitcoin price as a reference price is more useful.Based on the necessity of avoiding the price risk of Bitcoin as the background, this research chooses the random forest regression algorithm of machine learning and the LSTM model of neural network algorithm to predict the price of Bitcoin. I mainly focus on the performance of random forest regression in Bitcoin price prediction when using the prediction results of LSTM as a comparison. Random forest regression is a regression form of random forest. Different from the black box technology of neural networks, random forest regression as machine learning can deliver the importance of each explanatory variable in predicting Bitcoin through the results of its weak-learners.The prediction effect of random forest in predicting stock price direction has been proven effective (Basak et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2020). However, unlike random forest classifier, whose research goal is to classify ups or downs, there are not many papers that use random forest regression to study the cryptocurrency market in the existing literature. In the literature using random forest regression, the explanatory variables used by Parvez (2022) focus on the highly correlated OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and transaction volume of Bitcoin itself as explanatory variables. On this basis, I think it is of great research value to add explanatory variables in other fields. A total of 47 explanatory variables were collected for this study in the following 8 categories: (a) Bitcoin price variables, (b) the specific technical features of Bitcoin, (c) other cryptocurrencies, (d) commodities, (e) market index, (f) foreign exchange, (g) public attention, and (h) dummy variables of the week to verify the accuracy of random forest regression for Bitcoin price prediction.As a comparison of whether the prediction accuracy of random forest regression is good, this paper chooses the LSTM algorithm of RNN as comparative research. The experimental results of many studies show that the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU is better when compared with other models, including the traditional time series model ARMA.In addition to pursuing a high-precision forecasting model, this study also conducts (1) an in-depth analysis from the explanatory variables that determine the importance of Bitcoin prices and (2) the relationship between the prediction accuracy and the lag of the explanatory variables.The RMSE of the random forest regression model is smaller than LSTM algorithm. Although through the DM and Clark–West test, the hypothesis that LSTM is better than random forest regression cannot be rejected at a significant level of α = 95%. However, the error results of multiple experiments show the higher prediction accuracy of random forest regression.The experimental results of random forest regression also indicate the changes in the factors that determine the price of Bitcoin around 2018. The OHLC prices of Bitcoin itself are proven to be most important during the full sample period. In Period 1 from April 2015 to October 2018, the U.S. stock markets NASDAQ, DJI, and S&P500, which have high importance, show a sharp decrease in importance in the Period 2 sample from October 2018 to April 2022. The importance of ETH and DOGE, which are both digital currency markets, increased during Period 2.As an LSTM model that focuses on the study of time series data, the control experiments by substituting explanatory variables with different lags show that the prediction accuracy obtained only with the latest period of data is the highest. Random forest regression also delivered the same conclusion.Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing methodologies and models to predict the cryptocurrency prices. Section 3 discusses the setting of model parameters and error setting. Section 4 discusses the selection analysis and pre-processing of explanatory variables. Section 5 discusses the performance evaluation of the proposed model. Section 6 discusses the limitations of the research and directions for future attempts. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.Aggarwal et al. (2019) studied whether gold price can predict Bitcoin price through three deep learning algorithms of CNN, LSTM, and GRU. The conclusion is that the predicted price of the model which only uses gold price deviates from the true Bitcoin price, and the prediction accuracy of the LSTM model is the best of three. Liu et al. (2021) expanded the range of explanatory variables, based on the cryptocurrency market and macro market index (stock market index, crude oil price, exchange rate, etc.) and search index, a total of 40 explanatory variables for Bitcoin price prediction. SDAE algorism shows better prediction performance than BPNN, PCA-SVR, and SVR.LSTM, as a controlled study of random forest regression in this study, has been studied as a target model many times in the past literature (Shin et al. 2021; Jagannath et al. 2021; Rizwan et al. 2019). Phaladisailoed and Numnonda (2018) used four deep learning algorithms (Theil–Sen regression, Huber regression, LSTM, and GRU) to predict the price of Bitcoin. The 52.78% accuracy of the LSTM algorithm is the highest. Based on the same explanatory variables, Tandon et al. (2019) found that adding 10-fold cross-validation to the LSTM training process can increase the accuracy of LSTM by 14.7%. However, the selection of explanatory variables in Phaladisailoed's and Tandon's studies is limited to OHLC, volume from top exchange and market cap. In the research done by Aggarwal et al. (2019), in addition to the price of Bitcoin itself, gold price was added to explanatory variables. The experimental results show that the RMSE of the LSTM algorithm is 47.91, which is better than CNN and GRU. McNally et al. (2018) added the variables difficulty and hash rate related to Bitcoin attributes in his research, the 52.78% prediction accuracy of LSTM is also better than the accuracy of RNN and ARIMA. Chen et al. (2020a) used LSTM, SVR, ANFIS, and ARIMA, four algorithms to predict the Bitcoin price. While Chen added eight kinds of Bitcoin attribute variables, public attention variables (Google Trends and Twitter data) and economic category variables. In the four subsample periods, LSTM all showed better prediction accuracy than the other three. Livieris et al. (2020) introduced a novel framework by preprocessing, which performed a series of transformations based on first differences or returns, to make data 'suitable' for fitting a deep learning model based on the stationarity property.In addition to predicting the price of Bitcoin, there are many studies using LSTM to predict other digital currencies (Sebastião and Godinho 2021; Saadah and Whafa 2020; Derbentsev et al. 2020). Politis et al. (2021) used LSTM to predict the price of Ether with an accuracy of 84.2%. Livieris et al. (2021) used hybrid CNN-LSTM to conduct prediction experiments on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) with the highest market value at the time and obtained BTC The prediction accuracy of 55.03% is higher than ETH's 51.51% and XRP's 49.61%.In McNally et al.'s (2018), García-Medina and Duc Huynh's (2021), and Chen et al.'s (2020a) studies, it is mentioned that adding Dropout layers between each layer of LSTM can reduce the effect of overlearning. But there are differences in the choice of dropout coefficients (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) among the three works of literature above.Regarding the selection of explanatory variables, in addition to the macroeconomic variables used in many works of literature, Jagannath et al.'s (2021) research focuses on the core variables of the Bitcoin blockchain, including users, miners, and exchanges. Technical indicators have proven useful for predicting Bitcoin prices (Jaquart et al. 2021; Mudassir et al. 2020). The LSTM based on the self-adaptive technique also gets good prediction performance, but the article lacks a comparative experiment with the model added macroeconomic variables. Regarding the explanatory power of variables on Bitcoin price, García-Medina and Duc Huynh (2021) innovatively studied variables such as social media (E. Musk and D. Trump's remarks) and Tesla stock price. During the ups and downs in the second half of 2020, the conclusion was that the explanatory power of these variables that were of great interest at the time was not found. Carbó and Gorjón (2022), in their appendix, compare the effect of adding the previous period's Bitcoin price to the explanatory variables based on the LSTM algorithm. The RMSE accuracy of the model that added the previous Bitcoin price as an explanatory variable improved significantly from the original 21% to 11%.The selection of time unit prices is also a point that has been analyzed by m",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Chen,Junwei Chen",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/jrfm/jrfm-16-00051/article_deploy/html/images/jrfm-16-00051-g001-550.jpg?1673593400,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,8.182573,3a68ce4513662c53a26e82d471d07e47

The Central American country, in November 2021, revealed that it was planning to raise $1 billion through bitcoin-backed bonds. The issuance of these bonds was initially planned for March 2022. However, it had to be postponed several times owing to the onset of the brutal crypto winter since last year.It must be noted that these bonds would be denominated in US dollars, have a 10-year maturity date, and carry a 6.5 percent annual interest rate, as per their initial proposal. What would Bitcoin City offer?As per Bitfinex, a renowned crypto exchange and the technology provider for the Volcano bonds, issuance of Bitcoin-backed bonds would allow El Salvador to raise capital to pay for its sovereign debt, fund the building of the Bitcoin City as well as help in the creation of the Bitcoin mining infrastructure.The exchange further claims that the proposed Bitcoin City would be a special economic zone similar to those seen in China. They would offer tax advantages, and crypto-friendly regulations, as well as incentivise Bitcoin businesses for its residents.

The uniqueness of this investigation lies in empirically testing and proving the contagion spillover of Bitcoin attention to carbon futures. Specifically, several models are adopted to investigate the explanatory and predictive abilities of Bitcoin attention to carbon futures. The results can be generalized as follows. First, Bitcoin attention Granger causes the variation of carbon futures. Second, Bitcoin attention shows a negative impact on carbon futures and an addition, an invert U-shaped connection exists. Third, the Bitcoin attention-based models can beat the commonly used historical average benchmark during out-of-sample forecasting both in statistical and economic levels. Fourth, we complete robustness checks to certify that the contagion spillover from Bitcoin attention to the pricing of carbon futures does exist. Finally, we prove the linear and non-linear impacts from Bitcoin attention to realized volatility of carbon futures. All the results prove that Bitcoin attention is an important pricing factor for carbon futures market.

This article examines the asymmetric volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and alternative coin markets at the disaggregate level. We apply a frequency connectedness approach to the daily data of 11 major cryptocurrencies for the period from 1 September 2017 to 2 March 2022. We try to uncover the existence of the 'fear of missing out' psychological effect and 'pump-and-dump schemes' in the crypto markets. To do that, we estimate the volatility spillovers from Bitcoin to altcoin and the cryptos' own risk spillovers during bull and bear markets. The spillover results from Bitcoin to altcoin provide mixed results regarding the presence of this theory for major cryptocurrencies. However, the empirical findings carried out by the cryptos' own spillover effects fully confirm the existence of a fear-of-missing-out effect and pump-and-dump schemes in all cryptocurrencies except for USDT.
 




 
Cryptocurrencies have drawn considerable interest from investors, policymakers, and regulators since Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto (2008). With their widespread popularity among the public, they have become a popular topic in recent times among academicians, investors, portfolio managers, and regulators. Corbet et al. (2019) divided academic publications on cryptocurrencies into five main categories: bubble dynamics (Corbet et al. 2018b; Vranken 2017), regulation (Böhme et al. 2015; De Filippi 2014; Fletcher et al. 2021), cybercrime (Bernabe et al. 2019; Pinzón and Rocha 2016; Q. Wang et al. 2020), diversification (Chemkha et al. 2021; Urquhart and Zhang 2019), and efficiency (Khuntia and Pattanayak 2018; Nan and Kaizoji 2019; Vidal-Tomás and Ibañez 2018). However, we can extend the list of ranges from return-volume relationships and tail riskiness (Balcilar et al. 2017; Fousekis and Tzaferi 2021) to speculation (Blau 2018; Smaniotto and Neto 2020), as well as return-volatility transmissions between cryptocurrencies and other conventional financial markets (Bouri et al. 2018; Charfeddine et al. 2020; Corbet et al. 2018a).Unlike other financial assets that are not traded on holidays, the crypto market is open 24 h a day including weekends. Thus, it is important to examine volatility spillover within crypto markets at multiple frequencies (Mensi et al. 2021). Rather than looking through the whole directional risk spillovers among crypto assets, as in other studies (i.e., Brandvold et al. 2015; Ciaian et al. 2018; Fasanya et al. 2021; Katsiampa et al. 2019; Koutmos 2018; Mensi et al. 2021; Sensoy et al. 2021; Yi et al. 2018), we concentrate on the accumulated risk spillovers from Bitcoin to other major alternative coins from the first day to longer periods. Our main motivation for doing so is the fact that price movements in the crypto market are largely determined by Bitcoin (Corbet et al. 2018a; Kumar et al. 2022; Yi et al. 2018). In addition, we examine the cryptos' own risk spillovers at different frequencies. Indeed, our study is mainly related to two strands of studies in the crypto markets: studies investigating the relationship among crypto markets (Aslanidis et al. 2021; Fousekis and Tzaferi 2021) and studies examining the behavioral characteristics of cryptocurrency investors (Baur and Dimpfl 2018; J. N. Wang et al. 2021). This study differs from others in terms of the following aspects: The first aspect is the fact that the main risk coming from Bitcoin price movements to altcoins is neglected by these studies. When this fact is ignored, crypto investors cannot take full advantage of the study results. The second aspect is that we decompose the time domain into various frequencies, but we report the accumulated volatility spillover from Bitcoin to altcoins from the first trading day to the long-term investment horizon. In the third aspect, this study indeed provides different perspectives to test which kinds of investors (informed and uninformed) are dominant in the crypto market for the various altcoins under consideration. Lastly, we use a greater number of cryptos and try to select older major cryptocurrencies1 with higher market capitalization. Volatility and volatility spillovers have become hot topics of finance research since the development of the conditional heteroscedasticity models of Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1987). Subsequently, various generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models2 have been formulized in the literature after recognizing that volatility propagates asymmetrically (Ang and Chen 2002; Baruník et al. 2017). Later, Cappiello et al. (2006) introduced the asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation DCC (ADCC) specification to account for both multivariate and asymmetries in the conditional variances and the conditional correlations. Based on the realized semivariances proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2010), Baruník et al. (2016) propose a way to capture volatility spillovers that are due to bad and good volatility. As an alternative volatility spillover measurement approach, Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) developed a volatility spillover index (the DY index) based on forecast-error variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VAR). This technique, however, assumes that the spillover effects among markets are the same across different investment horizons. Still, this assumption fails to model market reality. Baruník and Křehlík (2018) extend the time-domain DY index to the frequency domain to overcome this deficiency. Rather than focusing on frequency responses, this approach is interested in assessing shares of uncertainty in one variable due to shocks with varying persistence levels. In addition, the DY index is better than other ways of measuring volatility, such as multivariate asymmetric GARCH models, because it can measure the direction of the spillover effect in short-, medium-, and long-term financial cycles. Against this background, the main goal of the present paper is to shed light on the existence of informed traders (or insiders) and uninformed noise traders in the cryptocurrency market. 'Fear of missing out' (FOMO) and pump-and-dump schemes have attracted the attention of researchers in cryptocurrency markets (Baur and Dimpfl 2018; Delfabbro et al. 2021; Park and Chai 2020; J. N. Wang et al. 2021; Xu and Livshits 2019). FOMO is the fear a trader or investor experiences when they miss out on a potentially profitable investment or trading opportunity in the context of financial markets and trading. The FOMO feeling is most apparent when the value of an asset climbs dramatically in a short period. On the other hand, crypto pump-and-dump schemes occur when conspirators use misleading information to inflate the value of a currency, then sell it for a profit. In this respect, it is wise to assume that the greater the number of uninformed noise traders and fraudsters in a certain altcoin market, the greater the risk of spillovers from bitcoin (or altcoins' prices) to related altcoins. The fact that bitcoin price crashes are followed by other altcoins in the cryptocurrency market confirms this argument. Our study is strongly related to various studies, such as those by Demir et al. (2021) and Brik et al. (2022), in the cryptocurrency finance literature. Demir et al. (2021) investigated the asymmetric effect of Bitcoin on ETH, XRP, and LTC using the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model for the period of July 2015 to March 2019. Their results indicated that the price of Bitcoin impacts altcoin prices asymmetrically in the short run for all altcoins and a decline in Bitcoin price has a higher effect on altcoins than a rise in Bitcoin price. On the other hand, Brik et al. (2022) examined the return and volatility transmissions between Bitcoin and ten stable and nonstable major cryptocurrencies from 8 October 2018 to 17 August 2020 utilizing the VARMA-BEKK-GARCH model. They provided evidence that volatility transmission is bidirectional in the short and long runs for Bitcoin/Ethereum and Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash but unidirectional in the short run for Bitcoin/Tether and Bitcoin/TrueUSD. Except for Bitcoin and TrueUSD, there is no long-term bidirectional volatility transmission. The main motivation for this study is to use asymmetric spillover measures to bring a different perspective to the issues that are frequently discussed in the finance literature. It is important for informed investors who want to invest in the crypto market to know in which altcoin market uninformed investors and fraudsters trade the most. Consequently, our work may be of interest to investors who want to recognize the risk coming from uninformed investors and adjust their investment strategy according to BTC price fluctuations.We examine bitcoin and a set of 10 major altcoins with the largest market capitalization and find interesting results about the spillover from Bitcoin to altcoins during different market conditions. Our data span from 1 September 2017 to 2 March 2022. Our empirical results show that the short- and long-term risk spillovers sourced by Bitcoin are larger for BNB, ETH, LTC, and USDT during bullish market conditions. However, the short- and long-term risk spillovers from Bitcoin to TRON and XRP are greater during bearish market conditions. For ADA and DOGE, the risk spillover emanating from Bitcoin during a bearish market exceeds the risk spillover during a bullish market after the tenth day. Moreover, regarding the risk spread from Bitcoin to BCH and LINK, we do not observe any obvious difference between the bull and bear markets. In addition to this analysis, we examine the cryptocurrency's own risk spillovers at various frequencies and volatility spillovers from BTC to altcoins during the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods. After COVID-19, the volatility spillover index from BTC to altcoins differs. For instance, the volatility spillover from BTC to BCH, DOGE, LINK, and TRX increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. The empirical findings clearly support FOMO and pump-and-dump schemes for all cryptocurrencies under consideration. Overall, we conclude that the FOMO of noise traders and the deployment of pump-and-dump schemes are inherent features of cryptocurrencies.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 entails the methodology used in this study. Section 3 gives a brief description of the data and some descriptive statistics about the data. Section 4 presents the empirical findings and discussion. Section 5 provides a conclusion.This study uses the frequency connectedness approach developed by Baruník and Křehlík (2018) to examine the risk (volatility) spillover from Bitcoin to eight major cryptocurrencies. This technique is an extension of the time-domain spillover index developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). We start by defining the

In addition to the total spillover index, it is possible to measure the spillover transmitted from the overall system to variable

 as
Similarly, the spillover transmitted from

 to the overall system as
The net spillover index for element

 is the difference
Lastly, the net pairwise spillover between markets

 is simply the difference between the gross volatility shocks transmitted from market

 and those transmitted from

To measure the volatility spillover in the frequency domain, we follow Baruník and Křehlík (2018) and describe the spectral formulation of the variance decomposition. For this purpose, we utilize the Fourier transform of the coefficients

20,Leading BTCC outfit BTC gets new name and expands into GT racing,Marcus Simmons,2023-01-21 00:00:00,date,https://www.autosport.com/btcc/news/leading-btcc-outfit-btc-gets-new-name-and-expands-into-gt/10431402/,autosport.com,Reigning British Touring Car Championship independent title-winning team BTC Racing has been renamed and is to expand into GT competition for 2023.,"The Brackley squad is now known as One Motorsport, and will continue to field Honda Civic Type R machinery in the BTCC this season.


Current team owner Steve Dudman bought out BTC founder in Bert Taylor in 2019, although Taylor stayed on at the squad until the end of the 2020 season.


The renaming removes the last vestiges of Taylor's era, and also eliminates what was at times confusion between it and the BTCC acronym.


Although the team is staying tight-lipped on drivers for now, One's driver line-up is expected to be spearheaded once again by Josh Cook, who has finished in the BTCC overall top six three times in the past four seasons with the squad's Civic FK8.


The GT expansion has come with the acquisition of Motus One, with that team's boss Will Powell arriving on board at One as its new commercial and marketing director.


The team has announced plans to compete in the British GT Championship, British Endurance Championship and McLaren Trophy, and it is understood that the target is to run cars in the GT3 and GT4 classes.


'The change of name is not to leave our achievements behind, but to plan for the future as we lift our company profile within the motorsport industry,' said Dudman.


'We are also so pleased to welcome Will Powell and the guys from Motus One to join us at Brackley with his expertise and the GT operation being brought to the business. We look forward to going racing.'




Motus One swapped its elderly McLaren for a Mercedes-AMG GT4 at the end of last year and will now form part of the renamed One Motorsport's operations

One managing director Danny Buxton, who was formerly head of McLaren customer racing before joining BTC before the 2022 season, added: 'It promises to be a super-exciting year as we embark into the GT customer racing arena for the first time.


'With our BTCC programmes already locked in for the year ahead, it gives us a super platform for on-track success and commercial growth.'


Powell, who competed in the BTCC as a driver last season in a Team Hard Cupra, said: 'I am delighted this has come together to create one of the strongest teams in British motorsport.


'In a relatively short period, my team at Motus One have worked hard to build a team capable of competing at the top.


'Joining forces with Steve Dudman and Danny Buxton in the newly formed One Motorsport takes things to the next level, providing customers with better support, equipment and facilities.


'I'm looking forward to leading the commercial operation, where I have always been at my strongest, and helping to drive forward the GT and BTCC programmes on track.'",autosport.com,8132,news,GB,en,"Marcus Simmons,t Staff",https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/amp/2GzPoVr0/s6/josh-cook-rich-energy-btc-raci.jpg,False,,8.638088,10c01962988af281310ad63757b9e844

Since Bitcoin has frequently witnessed price fluctuations and high volatility, the factors influencing its returns and volatility is an important research subject. To accomplish this goal, we applied the Gets reduction method which has a good reputation compared to other competing approaches in terms of the statistical apparatus available for a repeated search to determine the final set of determinants and the consideration of location shifts. We found that the reduced set of explanatory variables that affects Bitcoin returns is composed of Twitter-based economic uncertainty, gold return, the return of the Euro/USD exchange rate, the return of the US Nasdaq stock exchange index, market capitalization, and Bitcoin mining difficulty. In contrast, the volatility of Bitcoin is affected by only lagged terms of the ARCH effect and the volume of this cryptocurrency.
 




 
During the past two decades, the financial sector has experienced rapid developments in legislation, technologies and financial services, which created a dynamic and interconnected global financial environment; however, it is characterized by turbulence and volatility.These developments can be comprehended through the liberalization of financial markets, which contributed to the entry of funds and led to the elimination of traditional borders in the financial services industry (between various financial intermediaries). Additionally, they contributed to the globalization of financial institutions and the rapid growth in information and computer technologies.In the context of these changes, with the spread of the phenomenon of globalization and the interconnection of financial markets with each other, and the liberation of capital movement, the importance of digital currencies has appeared.Cryptocurrency has seen a significant spread in recent years. It attracts the attention of investors and researchers and the interest of the media, following the evolution of cryptocurrency prices. From early 2020 until now, the return of Bitcoin has increased by about 150%, whereby it exceeds the return on investment in gold and stock markets in emerging economies. Bitcoin uses about 0.15% of the world's energy production. The electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining is equivalent to a country of 120 million people. The effect on the environment is assessed by the quantity of CO2 emitted during the production of electricity. For the period between 2016 and 2021, on average, each dollar in Bitcoin market value produced was responsible for 0.35 dollars in global climate damages [1]. Regarding the importance of cryptocurrencies, it is useful to explore its most significant determinants. Cryptocurrencies are financial instruments which attract investors who are active traders. Consequently, this paper highlights determinants of Bitcoin return to help investors to undertake decisions before the investing process.Cryptocurrency has emerged as a decentralized alternative to standard monetary systems, while central banks and authorities cannot supervise digital currencies. Besides, cryptocurrencies present a decentralized payment network. They use peer-to-peer technology for transactions on their network. Blockchain technology promotes decentralization and anonymity. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain anonymously once requests are submitted. Moreover, verification is performed on a large network of nodes that facilitate the resolution of complex mathematical problems (hashes). After their creation, digital currencies are coded into their underlying algorithm.Several companies use and accept cryptocurrencies for exchange and payment transactions, which can be observed in a vast number of transactions. This demonstrates the usefulness of digital cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange [2,3,4]. Some authors have also proven cryptocurrencies' role as a hedging asset, as a safe haven or for portfolio diversification [3,5,6]. These features depend mainly on the correlation and convenience with other assets. The cryptocurrency market has become a crucial trend for an investor's portfolio.According to Corbet et al. [7], this market constitutes a new asset class. Henceforth, several studies are being carried out to know the Bitcoin price in relation to its different determinants. Thus, few studies use the Gets model to detect the most important subset of variables (drivers on Bitcoin price).This new class of assets is characterized by recurring bubbles and excessive volatility. In this framework, Cheah and Fry [8] have found that the fundamental price of Bitcoin is zero. On the other hand, several works have noticed that Bitcoin is highly fluctuated and can have spillover volatility towards other crypto assets or conventional assets [9,10,11]. Several authors have shown that Bitcoin returns can be influenced by certain behavioral variables; see Dias et al. [12]; Bouri et al. [13]. All these factors highlight the usefulness of studying the determinants of cryptocurrency returns through reduction methods. However, studies are rarely interested in these methods to reduce the set of determinants in explaining the returns of cryptocurrencies. The objective of our paper is to ensure this task by resorting to the general to specific modelling.Hendry and his co-authors took several years to develop general–specific modeling (Gets). An automated form of this method is offered by the PC Gets software [14]. The basic idea is to define a congruent general unrestricted model (GUM) integrating the key elements of a local process or a data-generating process (DGP) suitably and sufficiently. In other words, a DGP is not allowed to be eliminated as a result of repetitive specification tests. Then, several procedures and statistical tests are proposed by Gets to arrive at a congruent and more parsimonious model to describe the (local) DGP of the studied time series. The strength of this method is that it uses a variety of specification tests, taking sufficiently into account the different reduction and encompassing scenarios. In this respect, Lütkepohl [15] showed its good qualities as a reduction technique when the general unrestricted model is a single equation.This paper is devoted to the literature review in different ways. First, we apply the Gets method in order to arrive at the reduced set of determinants that explains the returns of cryptocurrencies. As far as we know, this method has never been applied before to determine the factors influencing cryptocurrency returns. Second, we use the Gets method to determine the factors acting on Bitcoin's volatility by assuming that the general unrestricted model of such volatility follows the log ARCH model.The rest of this work is divided as follows. Section 2 discusses drivers of Bitcoin price. Section 3 presents our empirical method. Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 concludes the paper.Regarding the fundamental value of Bitcoin, the discussion has caught the attention of several authors. The financial theory is based on the hypothesis of objectivity of financial values: each asset has at all times a fundamental value, which corresponds to the expectation that it will provide future revenue. Finance is supposed to present a trustworthy reflection of the real economy. This hypothesis suggests that at any moment, it is possible to calculate, for each asset, its true value, also called its fundamental value [16]. Some studies indicate that digital currency has no fundamental value [8,17] and show the presence of a bubble in the cryptocurrency [18]. Similarly, Baek and Elbeck [19] find that Bitcoin's return is not explained using its intrinsic value and that this digital currency has higher volatility than S&P 500 by up to 26 times.Other studies examine empirically the fundamental value and determinants of cryptocurrency. The defenders of the optic of fundamental value have used a battery of variables often divided into categories by using alternative methods [5,20,21].These indicators concerned different categories such as financial categories, macroeconomic categories and technical categories. Several papers provided an association between the value of Bitcoin and financial factors presented by the stock market of the majority of developed and emerging countries. For instance, the adoption of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) approached by Panagiotidis et al. [22] indicated a positive association between Bitcoin return and the stock market for countries such as China (Shanghai Stock exchange composite index) and the United States market (Nasdaq and Dow Jones indices). In addition, Chen et al. [20] proved the effect of the most popular stock market indices such as the Nasdaq, Dow 30, S&P500, FTSE100, SSE on Bitcoin return. Similarly, Kapar and Olmo [23] used the VECM as an estimation method for the period from July 2010 to May 2019, and they found a positive impact of S&P500. On the other hand, Klose [24] studied the similarities and differences between four cryptocurrencies and gold with respect to four determinants. To do so, the author estimated a Garch-in-mean system and found that liquidity premia are practically insignificant for gold and cryptocurrencies. However, volatility premia mark gold and cryptocurrencies. Brauneis et al. [25] focused on the determinants of cryptocurrency exchange liquidity. The authors found that the liquidity of the Bitcoin to US dollar market has little bearing on the liquidity of the larger financial markets. By using the same methods as Panagiotidis et al. [22] and a various number of predictors, Ciner et al. [26] examined the indicators of digital currencies returns for different quantiles. The most significant variables were US government bond indices and small company stock returns.Furthermore, the financial market macroeconomic factors may influence Bitcoin's performance [20,23,27]. In this line of research, Li and Wang [27] indicated that the effect of the economic variables was more important than technological indicators in the long term. They found out that some macroeconomic variables such as interest rate and USD money supply affected the return of Bitcoin. Similarly, Panagiotidis et al. [22] found a positive association between Bitcoin return and variables such as exchange rates, interest rates, gold and oil. By using Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive and Principal Component Analysis for eight years during the period from 2010 to 2018, Panagiotidis et al. [28] found that gold, federal fund effective rate and oil price affect significantly the return of Bitcoin, but the European central bank deposited facility rate was related negatively to the return of cryptocurrency. More recently, Chen and al. [20] indicated that gold price and oil price caused short term variation on Bitcoin return. Their results demonstrated that long short-term memory (LSTM) could reach better predictive results compared to the Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Kapar and Olmo [23] indicated a negative effect of gold price on Bitcoin return.A few studies have been interested in the role of Bitcoin as a hedging and a diversification tool, or as a safe haven in times of crisis [5,13,29]. Precisely, Brière et al. [30] used weekly data during the period 2010–2013 and focused on the connection between Bitcoin, fiat currencies, bonds, stocks and alternative investments such as commodities and denoted the important diversification role of Bitcoin, despite its high volatility. This latter result was in line with the Baur et al. [11] finding that showed that Bitcoin returns were not effectively affected by traditional asset categories such as stocks or bonds, implying the occasion for diversification.To analyze the main role of Bitcoin as a safe haven, Bouri et al. [13] used the Engle's bivariate Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model over the period 2011–2015. They used the Bitcoin return and other traditional financial assets such as stocks and commodities. Thus, they concluded that Bitcoin has a poor relationship with all factors. It was an effective diversifier; thus, it was not yet a safe hedge for investors. The same result obtained by Dubey [5] demonstrated the capability of diversification of Bitcoin. Similarly, Guesmi et al. [31] took into account the effective role of Bitcoin as a diversifier and a hedger. Using GARCH specifications in order to detect the asymmetry behavior of the spillover effect, they concluded that the portfolio made up of Bitcoin, oil, gold and stocks had lower risks than a portfolio made up with only oil, gold and stocks. Their goal was to examine the speculative feature of Bitcoin leading it to be a hedging tool.After the subprime crisis and the COVID 19 pandemic, a stream of literat",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Adel Benhamed,Ahlem Selma,Ahlem Selma Messai,Benhamed,El Montasser,Ghassen El Montasser,Messai",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/sustainability/sustainability-15-01761/article_deploy/html/images/sustainability-15-01761-g001-550.jpg?1673949203,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,7.574645,dbf02e16d88500b800d902e43881914c

It's not yet clear how many students have enrolled for this course, but this is a positive sign for the Bitcoin community. US college starts Bitcoin educationBy Emerging Tech Team: As the global adoption of cryptocurrency rises, educational institutions have also started to incorporate crypto into their 
curriculum as one of the top colleges in the US has begun teaching its students about the functioning of Bitcoin. As per a report in Cointelegraph, Texan A&M is offering a Bitcoin course to many of its students. The announcement was made by
Associate Professor Korok Ray of Mays Business School, who will be teaching the ""Bitcoin Protocol"" course to students in the 
College of Engineering and Mays Business School.
I will be teaching the first ever Bitcoin class at Texas A&M this spring!
— Korok Ray (@KorokRay) January 12, 2023Ray spoke about the curriculum in a 4 part tweet thread stating that the ""Programming Bitcoin"" series will follow the Bitcoin Protocol where students will be taught how to ""build a Bitcoin library from scratch.""Was not easy convincing committeeThe professor added that it was not easy convincing the college to add the Bitcoin course to the curriculum and he had to wait for months to get the programme approved by the college's curriculum committee body. However, it is not yet certain how many students have enrolled for this course.It has been observed that the lack of crypto knowledge is one of the biggest reasons that the public is wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In order for people to take crypto to the next level, high-quality crypto education needs to be incorporated into school and college curriculums. Josh Cowell, who is a crypto researcher, also believes that the introduction of such courses can improve one's financial literacy. It is also necessary that students be taught about the legal and regulatory implications of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies which play a pivotal role in the understanding of the crypto industry.Crypto education in India?Aruna Sharma, who is a Practioner Development Economist and Ex-Secretary General, GoI believes that ""crypto has attained a 'Ponzi' phenomenon among people who do not have exposure to what adds value to it and how it contributes to the strengthening and expansion of blockchain. Correct unbiased knowledge is the need of the day and those entrepreneurs who understand well will be able
to use it effectively.""At the moment, there has been no push for crypto or blockchain education in India as the anti-crypto sentiment still prevails.
With the RBI also pushing for a crypto ban, will India ever get its own blockchain education programme?

Crypto prices today: Bitcoin increases, Ether, Solana, & other currencies fall By Nidhi Bhardwaj: Top cryptocurrencies traded mixed on 17 January. The value of Bitcoin stood at $21,121.14, with almost a 0.05 percent increase as per the last 24 hours. For weeks, the price of Bitcoin traded below the $19,000 mark before the recent rise. Amid the growing market, there has been a significant price push in other currencies as well. This push led to a positive shift in the total crypto market volume by 5 percent to $50.17B. However, the global crypto market cap fell by 0.02 percent over the last day to $987.08B. At the time of writing this article (1000 IST), the value of Ethereum, similar to Bitcoin, witnessed an increase in its value after a few weeks. But yesterday, the market traded mixed, which led to a decrease in the value of Ethereum by 0.56 percent to $1,561.72. The price of Cardano also registered a loss of 2.90 percent to $0.347852. Similarly, Solana also plunged by 0.59 percent to $23.19.

Despite the climate commitments made by countries in the Paris Climate Agreement adopted in 2015 and reinforced during COP 21 and with notably less success during COP 22, world carbon emissions increased in both 2021 and 2022. It is increasingly unlikely that the world will achieve the targeted 50% carbon reduction by 2030, the reduction approximately needed for reducing global temperature rise since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to less than 1.5 deg. C. At the same time, there remain nearly 2 billion people in the world who have no or highly unreliable access to power. In developed countries, access to both clean energy and energy efficiency investment in residences within low to moderate income communities has also lagged. This paper provides a review of the 'Productive Use of Energy (PUE)', which is a means to add value to solar energy mini- and micro-grids to ensure investment worthiness and add more value to the communities being served. In this context, it posits an opportunity to leverage Bitcoin mining as a common PUE strategy applicable to new solar installations. Several actual pilot cases are described to demonstrate this potential throughout the world and at multiple scales. These include: (i) existing micro-grids with significant stranded energy to generate income that could be used to reduce the cost per kWh for the community; (ii) new solar micro-grids optimized to meet community load and mining operations; (iii) dedicated solar-powered Bitcoin mining mini-grids developed solely to create a funding stream for self-investment by communities for their benefit; and (iv) a low-income residential solar-powered Bitcoin miner to reduce the energy cost burden for residents. Several of these scenarios show significant potential to aid investment worthiness.
 




 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set a 2030 goal of 50% worldwide carbon reduction as a first step toward limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, above which more catastrophic climate change impacts are expected [1]. The Paris Climate Agreement, agreed to by 196 nations in 2015, established a less ambitious plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 2.0 °C [2], but the progress toward even this weak goal is not being made. In 2021, global greenhouse gas emissions were the highest of all time [3]. The following year (2022) is certain to have even bigger increases, especially because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has increased coal consumption [4].In parallel to desires to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations has established goals to achieve sustainability with equity [5]. With over 2 billion people without access to the economic engine that reliable energy brings [6], there is ample opportunity to integrate equity concerns into potential solutions for the developing world.Although access to electricity in emerging markets is improving globally, Africa's progress is lagging. According to the 2019 Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report [6], sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 68 percent of the global energy access deficit. In 2017, 573 million people in this location still lacked any access to electricity. By 2030, it is estimated that 90 percent of the global population without access to electricity will be concentrated in the region [6]. Furthermore, there is similar potential to right inequities related to participation by underserved communities in sustainability-related initiatives. For example, a 2021 report by the US EPA documents the disproportionately low participation of diverse people in the clean energy workforce and the inequitable energy cost burden on the poor [7]. Likewise, a 2020 UN report documents mixed progress in equity worldwide [8]. Group-based inequalities are declining in some parts of the world and worsening in others. Income inequality is decreasing between countries but is still greater than inequalities present in individual countries. A recent study by Munoz has highlighted how adoption of renewable energy can exacerbate energy inequality [9].There are a few stories that highlight early steps in advancing clean energy in low-income communities, wherever they are. PowerGen, a main developer for such projects, has provided power to more than 50,000 Africans who previously lacked electricity [10]. As of 2021, micro grid projects in India and Indonesia have recently brought power to over 100,000 people [11]. The World-Bank-funded Nigerian Electrification Project is bringing power to nearly 500,000 people [12].However, the micro-grids bringing power to communities gaining access to electricity for the first time have required recipient communities to pay unit energy costs reaching as high as USD 1.00–1.50 per kWh. This rate would be considered exorbitant in the developed world [13]. A more recent 2020 pricing for mini-grids noted typical unit energy costs of 0.49 USD/kWh [14]. Despite these high prices, people receiving the power are paying for it [15].There is a better way. A 2018 report by USAID-NREL emphasized the importance of adding income-generating systems to micro-grids to improve the affordability of power. The income derived from the value-added systems helps to pay for a portion of the micro- or mini-grid. As a result, the unit price of energy for the recipient community can be reduced. This notion of adding income-generating systems to mini- and micro-grids has been termed the productive use of energy (PUE) [16].A 2021 study developed by Power Renewable Energy Opportunities (PREO) provides some tangible benefits for PUE in sub-Saharan Africa [17]. A Rockefeller report likewise documented results from specific projects in helping to improve the affordability of solar micro grids in Africa [18].Power Africa has engaged in a massive effort to bring PUE-enhanced micro-grids to up to 66 million people in sub-Saharan Africa [19]. To do so, they have developed a productive use of energy toolbox that includes country-specific catalogs of PUE [20], all of which aim to strengthen local economies. Included in its PUE portfolio are agricultural processing technologies, food refrigeration and dryers, livestock and aquaculture solutions, pumping solutions for clean water, and solar-powered irrigation systems for agricultural use. This effort is a step forward, but it still is not easily scalable.Even more important, however, is the question of how to actualize investment in the PUE-enhanced micro-grids. The World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) documents that investment in these grids is the weak link, and at least USD 220 billion is needed to provide power access to nearly all the powerless people in Africa.There are no easy solutions to address this basic challenge from both development and investment standpoints. However, a 2019 NREL study suggested the use of ‘bundling' for addressing both [13]. Bundling relies upon common designs and processes that can be replicated for any site in such a way as to render efficiencies of scale to bring costs down. Two types of bundling were identified. The first is operational bundling, associated with the use of common processes to reduce development and operating costs. Included in operational bundling are: common designs and engineering, easing the pathways for acquiring equipment and contracts; common installation and commissioning processes; common operational and maintenance processes to reduce variability relative to O&M costs; standardized contracting to reduce variability relative to costs and performance; common productive use of energy (PUE) elements to enable communities to include similar economic assets in micro grids; common performance monitoring; and reporting connecting to a common database to enable ‘learning' from all projects to improve future ones.Another type of bundling is financial bundling, whereby multiple projects are aggregated into a single portfolio and the benefits and risks are blended, yielding greater opportunity for investment. Financial bundling includes pooled funds for micro-grid operations and growth and for the purchase of electrical devices within a micro- or mini-grid to both create a demand for electricity, which ideally better correlates load with supply. The authors suggested that financial bundling could enable crowdfunding to render more investment.One example of financial bundling was put forward by Cross Boundary Energy Finance in 2020. They proposed a model in which, post-construction, the micro- or mini-grid asset is purchased by a single-asset company. The revenues, risks, and costs are uniform with this strategy [21].Sun Exchange offers another example of financial bundling. It utilizes electronic outreach to crowdsource funding from anyone in the world at any scale in solar projects for schools, businesses, and other organizations. Prospective investors can purchase solar cells or panels for specific projects, allocating funds from their personal ‘digital wallet' managed by Sun Exchange. Then, after installation, the recipient organizations pay back the individual investors for the clean energy purchased from the solar cells they own. This payment is delivered to the investors' digital wallets [22].An alternative bundling and PUE strategy is posited here. The posed approach is reliant upon the rapidly burgeoning cryptocurrency transaction and processing industry for what we are terming ‘impact mining'. The elements of this strategy include:A common PUE that adds economic value to micro- and mini-grids through off-grid power usage; namely 100% renewably powered Bitcoin mining;A digital energy financial transaction technology by which energy use at community and individual energy-user levels is monitored and measured and then aggregated over discrete periods of time (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.); payment from energy user to energy provider(s)/investors can be made automatically using the Bitcoin Lightning Network; leveraging either local currency or Bitcoin as the transaction currency start and endpoints;An automated and smart contracting vehicle that enables investment from one or thousands of crowd funders (termed ‘impact miners' here) to a specific project, with terms agreeable to all parties.In what follows, we review the potential for attaching 100% renewably powered Bitcoin mining as a PUE for solar micro- and mini-grids. To set the stage for this, a brief background on Bitcoin, with the pros and cons associated with its adoption, on the mining aspect of Bitcoin, likewise with pros and cons established, and on its use in financial transactions is provided.A.Bitcoin is a form of decentralized cryptocurrency, reliant on a peer-to-peer network called the blockchain to record transactions. It is not tied to any regulatory authority [23]. Blockchain is associated with what are called hash functions, which provide a unique record of and authenticate every financial transaction. When each transaction is verified as unique, it is sent to join a 'block' of other transitions. At this stage, it becomes impossible to modify. Blockchain represents the assemblage of these blocks.Blockchain uses many voluntary computer servers to validate Bitcoin network transactions based upon cryptography. These transactions are said to be irreversible. They cannot be undone or changed [24].All Bitcoin transactions are documented and public, even though the people involved in processing the transactions are anonymous. It is virtually impossible to hack the system, unlike the data breaches that have increasingly been seen with traditional financial transaction companies [24]. When Bitcoin is bought, sold, or transacted, no personal information (passwords, credit card numbers, addresses, etc.) is transmitted [24].In the Bitcoin network, each computer/server performing hashes is referred to as a node, of which there now are over 100,000 worldwide, thus insuring robustness. If one of the nodes fails, any among the rest can perform the necessary functions. Data security is ensured by the fact that a person interested in hacking the system for information does not know which node or nodes will be called upon for specific hashes [24]. Other cryptocurrencies are not tied to hardware processing (and thus energy use) and are generally deemed less secure than Bitcoin. It is for this reason that Bitcoin has continued to be the dominant cryptocurrency in the world.Bitcoin has been suggested to be an equalizing economic force for the world. After its inception, it was hailed as 'offering a vision of money free from central bank and intermediaries' control.' The place of the dollar and RMD as currencies of exchange worldwide preference the monetary policies of, respectively, the US and China. This absence of ownership of currency is especially important for developing countries, where many borrowers borrow heavily using US currency even with non-US lenders. That so much debt worldwide is in terms of US dollars makes the US Fed policy more powerful internationally than it would otherwise be.

We have made commitments to grow additional capacity under our control to over 20,000 miners and I look forward to the progress the BitNile team will achieve in the coming weeks.'

The Company notes that beyond the first five contracts with Bitmain, it has two more previously announced purchase agreements for an additional 1,325 S19j Pro Antminers estimated to be delivered over the first quarter 2023 and 1,140 S19 XP Hydro Antminers anticipated to be delivered during the summer of 2023. Once all of the miners are fully deployed and operational, BitNile expects to achieve a mining production capacity of approximately 2.67 EH/s, which will generate an expected annualized revenue run rate of approximately $72 million, based on current market conditions.

Ault notes that all estimates and other projections are subject to the actual delivery and installation of Bitcoin miners, the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, the ability to build out and provide the necessary power, and other factors that may impact the results of production or operations.

'We are excited to take this step and join the growing number of companies that are leveraging the power of Ethereum to unlock new opportunities and reach new audiences,' said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. 'Upstream represents the next generation of financial platforms, and we believe that dual-listing on this platform will help us to continue driving growth and value for our shareholders.' In addition to dual-listing on Upstream, BTCS is also an investor in Horizon, and has staked over 8,400 ETH on its 240 validator nodes on Ethereum's blockchain, further demonstrating the Company's commitment to utilizing decentralized technologies it supports. 'Ethereum's blockchain technology enables fair markets by ensuring transparency and immutability of transactions,' continued Charles Allen. 'Upstream is utilizing this technology to lead the charge in protecting and empowering both issuers and investors.

An ultrasensitive and selective voltammetric sensor with an ultratrace-level detection limit is introduced for ketoconazole (KTC) determination in real samples using a modified carbon paste electrode with a sheaf-like Ce-BTC MOF nanostructure and ionic liquid. The as-synthesized nanostructure was characterized by several techniques, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The electrocatalytic performance of the developed electrode was observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry. The limit of detection (LOD) of the developed sensor for KTC is 0.04 μM, and the response was found to be in the dynamic concentration range of 0.1–110.0 μM in a phosphate buffer solution. The proposed electrode exhibits acceptable electrocatalytic activity for KTC oxidation with a high sensitivity of 0.1342 μA·μM−1. The ability of the fabricated sensor to monitor KTC in real aqueous samples is demonstrated using standard addition data.
 




 
Ketoconazole (KTC) is a synthetic imidazole Cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazole-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolon-4-yl] methoxy] piperazin (see Figure 1) that acts as an oral antifungal agent with a broad spectrum against systematic and superficial fungi. KTC can block the production of fungal ergo sterol, thereby disrupting the permeability of the cell membrane and ultimately preventing its growth. Exposure to KTC can be associated with changes in cytochrome P-450, which has central functions in the detoxification of biologically active substances as well as in the activity of epoxide hydrolase [1,2,3,4,5,6]. In addition to damaging the fungal mitochondrial and microsomal enzymes, its mechanism of action is the destruction of the fungal cytoplasmic membrane. It is extensively applied in people with immunodeficiency and prostate cancer [7,8]. Compared to other identical agents, it has a wide range of functions and few complications. Some of the applications of KTC are the formulation of products such as shampoo, gel, cream, lotion, and foam [9,10,11].It is essential to quantify KTC through ultraviolet detection [12,13,14,15], spectrophotometry [16,17], and capillary electrophoresis [18]. Despite various advantages, these methods have some disadvantages because they are costly, time-consuming, and environmentally incompatible, and require much experience. Electrochemical approaches have aroused great attention because of their merits such as cost-effectiveness, simplicity, portability, rapidity, and high selectivity in biological fluids, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26].An interesting and recent approach is chemically modified electrodes (CMEs), which are mainly used for selective and sensitive electrochemical determination. They can mediate the electrode reaction through a significant reduction in over-potential, independent of pH, with a fast and stable reaction in redox response [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. In 1979, an electrochemical approach called the chemical modification of the carbon paste electrode surface was proposed [38,39]. Researchers have introduced various modifiers to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of various carbon-supported electrodes, some of which include metal nanoparticles (NPs), metal oxide NPs, conductive polymers, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [40,41,42,43,44,45].MOFs are porous materials with infinite crystal networks that are the result of metal ion bonding and function as coordination centers possessing multifunctional organic molecules. MOFs are of particular importance due to their beneficial properties, such as controllability, adjustable capabilities, high porosity, large specific surface area, host–guest interplay, and great thermal stability. Various applications have been reported for MOFs, including gas storage/separation, catalysis, drug delivery, and detection with electrochemical applications, which can be attributed to the electrochemical performance of metal ions and the ordered porous framework. Various types of MOFs are synthesized at high temperature, high pressure, or with organic solvents, which not only increases the cost of fabrication but also makes large-scale production difficult [46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53]. The synthesis of mixed-valence Ce-MOFs occurs rapidly at an ambient temperature in aqueous solution, saving considerable time and energy costs [54,55]. In addition, these compounds can catalyze reversible redox responses with enzymatic-like performance, thus having a good catalytic impact on KTC oxidation.Certain properties have been reported for ionic liquids (ILs) such as toxicity, chemical–thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and the ability to dissolve various organic and inorganic substances [56]. There is a broad field of application of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in analytical chemistry. RTILs are mixed with carbon substances to construct the conductive composites applied in electrochemical structures due to advantages such as a low vapor pressure, high conductivity, a wide electrochemical window, satisfactory chemical–thermal stability, and negligible toxicity [57,58,59,60,61,62].In the present study, for KTC detection, the ionic liquid exhibited an excellent sensitivity and electric conductivity with highly rapid electron transfer in electroanalysis, and the sheaf-like (SL) Ce-BTC MOF nanostructure (NS) enhanced the electrochemical profile of CPE. For the first time, the as-fabricated modified electrode possessed high KTC sensing activity with a broad linear dynamic range, ultralow detection limits and outstanding sensitivity.An Autolab galvanostat/potentiostat device (PGSTAT 302N, Metrohm Ltd., Herisau, Switzerland) equipped with GPES 4.9 software was utilized to perform all electrochemical determinations. The routine three-cell system applied in this study consisted of a modified CPE (IL/SL Ce-BTC MOF NS/CPE) working electrode, a Metrohm Ag/AgCl/KClsat reference electrode and a platinum wire auxiliary electrode. The pH of fresh solutions prepared with deionized water (Direct-Q® 8 UV water purification system; Millipore; Germany) was adjusted with a digital pH meter (Metrohm 713, Switzerland). An X-ray diffractometer (Cu/Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 nm; XRD; Panalytical X'Pert Pro; the Netherlands) was employed to record the XRD patterns. A scanning electron microscope (MIRA3, Tescan, Czech Republic) connected to an EDX system was used to perform FE-SEM analysis.In our study, all chemicals were of analytical grade from Sigma-Aldrich with no need for additional purification. H3PO4 was used for the preparation of phosphate buffer solution. The pH adjustment was performed with NaOH.The method proposed by Liu and colleagues was followed to construct the SL Ce-BTC MOF NS [63]. Thus, 0.2171 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water to prepare metal salt aqueous solution with a pH value of 3.5. Then, the solution was slowly poured into 1,3,5 benzene tricarboxylic acid (1,3,5-BTC; 0.10 g) water–ethanol solution (1:1 v/v; 40 mL) at an ambient temperature while vigorously stirring for 10 min. Next, the centrifugation was carried out to obtain the white precipitate that formed, followed by rinsing thoroughly with ethanol/deionized water and drying.The Ce-BTC MOF NS and ionic-liquid-modified carbon paste electrode (Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE) was fabricated by mixing 0.8 mL of IL, 0.4 g of Ce-BTC MOF NS, and 0.9 g of paraffin oil and graphite powder in a mortar to obtain a uniform wet paste, which was then compressed in the bottom of a glass tube. A copper wire was embedded in the glass tube behind the mixture to achieve an electrical contact. After removing the excess paste, a weighing paper was applied to polish and create a new surface. The comparison was performed for CPE; IL/CPE, unmodified (bare) CPE, Ce-BTC MOF/CPE, and IL-CPE.Five KTC tablets (containing 200 mg of KTC) were first powdered, and then 200 mg of the powder was dissolved in 25 mL water under ultrasonication. Next, variable volumes of as-diluted solution was diluted to the mark of a 25 mL volumetric flask with PBS (pH 7.0). The standard addition method was followed to determine the KTC content.The instantly refrigerated urine specimens, at a certain volume (10 mm), were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. Then, the supernatant was filtered by a filter, and various volumes of it were diluted to the mark of a 25 mL volumetric flask with PBS (pH 7.0). Next, the diluted specimens were spiked with various concentrations of KTC.The EDX analysis was employed to examine the SL Ce-BTC MOF NSs' chemical composition, the results of which revealed signals related to Ce, C, and O that verified the fabrication of Ce-BTC MOF (see Figure 2).The crystal structure of SL Ce-BTC MOF NS was determined by the XRD pattern (Figure 3). Some sharp peaks appeared in the XRD pattern of Ce-BTC MOF, which ranged from 5° to 50°, confirming a good crystal structure of the as-fabricated sensor. The characteristic peaks at Ce-MOF were in line with a previous study on Ce-BTC MOF [63].Figure 4a–c illustrate the FE-SEM images used to examine the Ce-BTC MOF's morphological and structural features. It can be observed that the Ce-BTC MOF consists of an array of dispersed nanorods (with a mean diameter of ~90 nm) that are joined together in the middle to construct straw-SL structures.The electrocatalysis of KTC on the surface of Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE could be significantly influenced by the pH of the supporting electrolyte. The influence of pH on the determination of KTC (50.0 μM) in the exposure to PBS was examined on the surface of the modified electrode at variable pH values between 2.0 and 9.0. The pH value of 7.0 had the greatest oxidation peak current of KTC. Hence, pH = 7.0 was chosen as the best value for the next test.To compare with unmodified CPE, IL-CPE, and Ce-BTC MOF/CPE, cyclic voltammetry was performed to explore the electrochemical behavior of Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE in relation to KTC (70.0 μM) in 0.1 M PBS at 50 mV/s. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were captured for all as-prepared electrodes in 0.1 M PBS with the pH value of 7.0 and a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Figure 5 shows a strong peak current resulting from the electrode surface modification with the porous and conductive MOF NS. The ionic liquid could facilitate the electron transfer, thus remarkably boosting the oxidation peak current. The Ipa value (μA) was estimated at 1.8 for CPE, 3.9 for Ce-BTC MOF/CPE, 6.5 for IL-CPE, and 9.9 for Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE in relation to the KTC oxidation. These results demonstrated the success of the method for CPE modification in the proposed electrode fabrication.Linear sweep voltammetry was performed to determine the scan rate influence on the electrochemical performance of KTC on the surface of Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE. According to the results (Figure 6), there was a gradual elevation in the oxidation peak current when the scan rate increased to 400 from 5 mV/s. As seen in Figure 6 (inset), there was linearity for the anodic peak currents (Ipa) vs. the scan rate square root (v1/2), R2 = 0.999. A linear elevation occurred for the peak current of oxidation with the v1/2, highlighting a diffusion-controlled process for the KTC electro-oxidation on the Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE surface in the tested range of scan rates.To analyze the rate-determining step, a Tafel plot was obtained in accordance with the points of LSV for KTC (50.0 μM) on the surface of Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE (scan rate = 5 mV/s). As seen in Figure 7 (inset), the Tafel plot was applied to compute the electron transfer coefficient (α = 0.49) with the slope of 2.3RT/n (1 − α) F (0.1161 V).Chronoamperometric analysis was carried out for the KTC determination on the surface of Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE (Figure 8) at the electrode potential of 0.3 V against variable KTC levels (100.0, 600.0, 1100.0 and 1500.0 μM) with a buffer solution pH of 7.0 (Figure 8). Cottrell's equation (I = nFAD1/2Cbπ−1/2t−1/2) was run to describe the current of the electrochemical reaction under the limited condition of mass transport for the electroactive KTC with the diffusion coefficient of D [64]. Figure 8A illustrates the plots of I against t−1/2 used with the best fit for variable KTC levels. The slopes from the straight lines were diagramed versus variable KTC levels (Figure 8B). Based on the Cottrell equation and slope, the D was found to be 5 × 10−6 cm2/s.The limit of detection and linear dynamic range were computed by the differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs). Figure 9 depicts the DPVs from Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE at variable KTC levels in 0.1 M PBS. The oxidation peak current of KTC was gradually boosted when the KTC concentration increased, verifying the high potency of the as-fabricated electrochemical sensor in the electro-oxidation of KTC. The changes in the peak currents of KTC oxidation on the Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE surface vs. the KTC content are presented in Figure 9 (inset). The linear dynamic range was as wide as 0.1–110.0 μM. Moreover, the limit of detection, Cm, of KTC was calculated using the following equation: where m is the slope of the calibration plot (0.1342 μA/μM), and Sb is the standard deviation of the blank response which was obtained from 15 replicate measurements of the blank solution. The limit of detection obtained using this method was 0.04 μM.A comparison of the electroanalytical parameters for KTC detection with those previously reported in the literature [8,65,66,67,68] is presented in Table 1.The effect of several interference species on the determination of KTC was studied. The results show that the interfering effects of Zn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, K+, Na+, Co2+, and Mg2+ ions, and glycerin, ascorbic acid, lactose, glucose, and sodium benzoate on the anodic peak current of KTC is less than 5%. Hence, the Ce-BTC MOF/IL/CPE sensor has a superior selectivity for KTC.The practical applicability of the as-fabricated modified electrode was analyzed by sensing KTC in pharmaceuticals and urine specimens in accordance with the standard addition method. Table 2 shows the obtained experimental data. The recovery rates were recorded between 96.7% and 103.6%, and the relative standard deviations were ˂3.5%, which show the potential of the as-fabricated electrode for sensing the KTC in the real matrices.In this study, for the first time, we modified the surface of the carbon paste electrode with the Ce-BTC MOF NS and ionic liquid for electrochemically sensing KTC. The as-developed electrode had high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting the study analyte, with a narrow limit of detection. The linear dynamic range was as broad as 0.1–110.0 μM (R2 = 0.9906), and the limit of detection was as narrow as 0.04 μM in the optimized setting. Further, the diffusion coefficient was 5 × 10−6 cm2/s, and the electron transfer coefficient was 0.49. The practical applicability of the as-fabricated modified electrode was confirmed by sensing KTC in real pharmaceuticals and urine specimens, with satisfactory recoveries.

This article investigates the dynamical complexity and fractal characteristics changes of the Bitcoin/US dollar (BTC/USD) and Euro/US dollar (EUR/USD) returns in the period before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we applied the asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) method to investigate the temporal evolution of the asymmetric multifractal spectrum parameters. In addition, we examined the temporal evolution of Fuzzy entropy, non-extensive Tsallis entropy, Shannon entropy, and Fisher information. Our research was motivated to contribute to the comprehension of the pandemic's impact and the possible changes it caused in two currencies that play a key role in the modern financial system. Our results revealed that for the overall trend both before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, the BTC/USD returns exhibited persistent behavior while the EUR/USD returns exhibited anti-persistent behavior. Additionally, after the outbreak of COVID-19, there was an increase in the degree of multifractality, a dominance of large fluctuations, as well as a sharp decrease of the complexity (i.e., increase of the order and information content and decrease of randomness) of both BTC/USD and EUR/USD returns. The World Health Organization (WHO) announcement, in which COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, appears to have had a significant impact on the sudden change in complexity. Our findings can help both investors and risk managers, as well as policymakers, to formulate a comprehensive response to the occurrence of such external events.

This report also predicts the crypto trend in 2023.
According to the report, affected by factors such as the macro environment and bull-to-bear transition, the whole cryptocurrency industry became bearish in 2022. In particular, following the Terra meltdown in May, most cryptocurrency sectors were hit by the bearish impact. Below is the overview of each segment.
1. Bitcoin
In 2022, the overall performance of Bitcoin remained sluggish, with significant declines in price and trading volume compared to 2021. The price at the end of 2022 even fell below the peak of the last bull market. The price trend of Bitcoin throughout the year is obviously influenced by the pace of US interest rate hikes, but as the US interest rate hike policy continues to advance, its impact on the price of bitcoin is gradually diminished. Regarding BTC mining, the network difficulty remained at a historic high. Meanwhile, the mining revenue plummeted, and miners have had to shut down their old models. Affected by multiple factors, the mining industry witnessed a strong crowding-out effect, which drove owners of small mining farms out of the market for various reasons. At the same time, long-established mining pools and mining farms managed to maintain a certain level of stability.

2. Ethereum
The primary statistics of Ethereum trended downward in 2022. In addition to the secondary market price and transaction volume, the on-chain data, including TVL, transaction cost, active address and burning volume also took a plunge. Despite that, the network did achieve a lot of progress in 2022. On September 15, Ethereum completed the historic transition from PoW to PoS. The Merge significantly cut the network's energy consumption and daily output, thereby reducing the dumping pressure from secondary markets. Meanwhile, Layer 2 projects such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Starknet launched their mainnet either in whole or in part. Although their daily transaction volume was far less than Ethereum mainnet, the projects exceeded Ethereum in terms of the number of addresses. Moreover, their gas fee was generally 1/40 of that charged by Ethereum. At the same time, the network also saw an exponential increase in gas fees during 2022.

3. Stablecoins
The stablecoin market as a whole was stable in 2022. Specifically, throughout the year, the supply of stablecoins fell from $157 billion to $148 billion, a 6% drop. In this regard, the fall was not substantial. With respect to centralized stablecoins, USDT maintained its dominance, while BUSD is growing rapidly on Binance's back. By contrast, algorithmic stablecoins were hit hard by the fall of LUNA, which shattered the faith in decentralized stablecoins and reduced trading volumes. As a result, there was a clear drop in the number of new decentralized stablecoins.

4. Public chains
Despite the rough market conditions in 2022, public chains remained a competitive sector. Due to the overflow of demand caused by the congestion of the Ethereum network, the new public chain with low fees maintained a bright performance before May. However, as various bad news brewed and fermented, a series of bankrupt occurred one after another. Many public chains were greatly impacted, and the decline was even worse than that of Ethereum. In May, Terra collapsed in only a few days, making it the first well-known public chain to fall. Furthermore, the Terra meltdown was also a signal that the market turned fully bearish. In November, hit by the fall of FTX and Alameda Research, Solana's token price and TVL took another plunge, and the projects within its ecosystem were also hurt. Other new chains such as Fantom and Avalanche were also struggling. At the same time, a number of new public chains, including Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum and Optimism and Meta-related chains such as Aptos and Sui, made their debut in 2022.

5. NFT
Last year, the NFT sector declined after its initial boom. In April, the market cap of the NFT reached $4.15 billion, a historic high; In May, driven by the boom of Otherside, a metaverse NFT collection developed by Yuga Labs, the trading volume of the sector hit a record high of $3.668 billion. But soon afterward, as the NFT market turned sluggish, the trading volume declined. Meanwhile, the price of blue-chip NFTs, as well as the ETH price, plummeted, which both negatively affected the market. On the other hand, the number of NFT holders kept growing and reached a historic high in December.

6. DeFi
DeFi's TVL also trended downward in 2022. In particular, during the LUNA/UST meltdown in May, mainstream coins witnessed the most spectacular crash in the history of cryptocurrencies, which was followed by a TVL collapse. Additionally, over the year, DeFi also suffered frequent hacks, which raised security concerns for DeFi. In terms of innovation, although the first two quarters of 2022 saw trending hypes about DeFi 2.0 from time to time, along with the slump of OHM and the (3, 3) meme, DeFi 2.0 was almost proven to be a completely false narrative, and the market shifted its attention back to DeFi 1.0 infrastructure projects such as Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO. Despite the bearish conditions, mainstream DeFi projects including AAVE and Compound managed to maintain steady operations and attracted many new users from certain CeFi projects (e.g. Celsius and FTX).

7. SocialFi
In 2022, the blockchain industry continued to explore new possibilities for SocialFi. Over the year, we saw the appearance of iconic terms like Fan Token, Soulbound Token (SBT), Web3 Social, and Decentralized Identity (DID), but the PMF (Product- Market Fit) was never identified. Despite that, the SocialFi still managed to present us with a number of star projects, including Web3 lifestyle app STEPN featuring SocialFi elements, credential network Galxe, BNB Chain domain name service SPACE ID, social graph Lens Protocol, and Web3 gamified social learning platform Hooked Protocol. Apart from that, the 2022 Qatar World Cup also helped Fan Tokens attract extensive market attention. As a result, instead of plummeting due to the bearish impact, the Fan Tokens also performed slightly better in 2022 than in 2021.

8. GameFi
2022 was also the beginning of the GameFi bear. There was no significant innovation in P2E blockchain game model. As the growth of users and trading volumes dwindled, institutional investors looked away from the P2E model. In the first half of the year, the Move-2-Earn model created by STEPN captured the spotlight with its innovative dual tokenomics and marketing approach, bringing new dynamics to GameFi. Last year, blockchain projects raised the largest funds in April, with blockchain investments totalling $6.62 billion. However, the market didn't respond to other project teams focusing on the reality plus token model. As the multi-chain ecosystem gained growing popularity, Ethereum maintained its dominance in the GameFi ecosystem, but the growth rate of projects on Ethereum failed to match that of BNB Chain and Polygon. In addition, most chains relied heavily on their top projects, and there were still plenty of low-quality GameFi projects with a small user base, subpar interactions and low trading volumes.

9. Regulatory policies
Generally speaking, for the cryptocurrency industry, 2022 was full of ups and downs, but regulations are headed in the right direction. Over the past year, regulators in the developed world achieved a lot of progress. The United States released a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies; the European Union initially approved the MiCA Act and the TFR Act; the United Kingdom and South Korea made progress in the establishment of the relevant organizations; Russia and Hong Kong promoted the discussion and implementation of policies for cryptocurrency mining and virtual asset securities. The turbulence that happened in the cryptocurrency industry in 2022 was partially the result of the sharp drop in funds and partially the result of regulatory loopholes and crackdowns. Last year, the bankruptcy of Terra and FTX, two top cryptocurrency projects, prompted national regulators and law enforcement agencies to further enhance their cryptocurrency oversight and investigations.

54,BTCS Plans to Distribute New Preferred Stock to All Common Holders*,Btcs Inc.,2023-01-31 00:00:00,date,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/31/2598498/0/en/BTCS-Plans-to-Distribute-New-Preferred-Stock-to-All-Common-Holders.html,globenewswire.com,"Silver Spring, MD, Jan. 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) ('BTCS' or the 'Company'), a blockchain technology-focused company, created...","Silver Spring, MD, Jan. 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) ('BTCS' or the 'Company'), a blockchain technology-focused company, created a new series of convertible preferred stock, designated Series V Convertible Preferred Stock (the 'Voucher'), and plans to distribute these Vouchers to each and every shareholder of record as of a to be announced record date. Each Voucher is intended to be convertible into one share of the Company's common stock listed on a security exchange that utilizes blockchain technology, subject to certain approvals and the terms of the Voucher's Certificate of Designation filed with the state of Nevada. 'We are excited to announce the creation and potential distribution of the Voucher, which we believe will create a pathway for every single BTCS shareholder to utilize blockchain technology seamlessly in their daily lives on an exchange where order books are enforced by blockchain smart contracts,' said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. 'Exchanges built on blockchain technology should enable transparent public orderbooks, eliminate failure to delivers, provide access to a global digital-first investor base, and enable direct to investor communications, distributions, and dividends without the friction we encountered with the processing of our Bividend.' Allen continued, 'In order to have fair and transparent markets which protect our retail investors, the time is now to move away from T+2 settlement. For the integrity of our markets and the protection of all investors, we need to embrace blockchain technology and have real-time settlement. Taking this step and creating a path to have every single BTCS shareholder utilize this technology is a way BTCS can illustrate the power of blockchain technologies we secure, and, hopefully, jump-starting and fast-tracking the ongoing discussion initially proposed by the SEC on February 9, 2022.' 'It's unconscionable that since going public, BTCS has been on the Reg SHO Threshold List 77 times; further, between January 7 and January 19, 2022 a total of 2.16 million shares failed to deliver, representing approximately 26% of our public float as of December 31, 2021, raising many questions about the efficacy of current systems,' continued Allen. 'With blockchain technology and instant settlement, intermediaries could be eliminated, thus reducing potential share imbalances and the risks and costs associated with traditional T+2 settlements. This move represents our commitment to innovation and delivering superior value to our investors.' Some claim blockchain technology lacks real world applications, however, security exchanges built on blockchains such as Ethereum are strong use cases that illustrate the potential future of capital markets. BTCS believes the time to start transitioning is now. While BTCS highlighted this use case in an investor presentation filed as an exhibit to an 8-K on July 7, 2015 (page 7), only now, after years of research, are we finally in a position to make this a reality. This is a natural extension of BTCS's commitment to innovation and reflects the Company's belief in both Ethereum and the potential of decentralized technologies to bring innovation to traditional financial markets. The Vouchers will have no voting rights, no rights to dividends, be redeemable by the Company after one year from issuance, and not be eligible for conversion after December 31, 2024. The record date for the distribution of the Vouchers will be announced upon achieving greater clarity on certain administrative processes for effecting it, which includes successfully obtaining a DTC eligible CUSIP, among other things. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their financial advisor to understand the terms of the Voucher and its potential impact on their investment in BTCS. *Investor NoticeWhile the Voucher is not deemed a 'sale' under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Company does not believe it is a 'sale' under states securities laws, investors should consider the following disclaimer: This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Voucher and no offer, solicitation or sale of the Voucher shall be made in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Offers, solicitations and sales of the Voucher will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, forming a part of an effective registration statement or under an applicable exemption from registration.

This paper introduces a unique perspective towards Bitcoin safe haven and hedge properties through the Bitcoin halving cycle. The Bitcoin halving cycle suggests that Bitcoin price movement follows specific sequences, and Bitcoin price movement is independent of other assets. This has significant implications for Bitcoin properties, encompassing its risk profile, volatility dynamics, safe haven properties, and hedge properties. Bitcoin's institutional and industrial adoption gained traction in 2021, while recent studies suggest that gold lost its safe haven properties against the S&P500 in 2021 amid signs of funds flowing out of gold into Bitcoin. Amid multiple forces at play (COVID-19, halving cycle, institutional adoption), the potential existence of regime changes should be considered when examining volatility dynamics. Therefore, the objective of this study is twofold. The first objective is to examine gold and Bitcoin safe haven and hedge properties against three US stock indices before and after the stock market selloff in March 2020. The second objective is to examine the potential regime changes and the symmetric properties of the Bitcoin volatility profile during the halving cycle. The Markov Switching GARCH model was used in this study to elucidate regime changes in the GARCH volatility dynamics of Bitcoin and its halving cycle. Results show that gold did not exhibit safe haven and hedge properties against three US stock indices after the COVID-19 outbreak, while Bitcoin did not exhibit safe haven or hedge properties against the US stock market indices before or after the COVID-19 pandemic market crash. Furthermore, this study also found that the regime changes are associated with low and high volatility periods rather than specific stages of a Bitcoin halving cycle and are asymmetric. Bitcoin may yet exhibit safe haven and hedge properties as, at the time of writing, these properties may manifest through sustained adoption growth.
 




 
A Bitcoin halving event is defined as an event that decreases a Bitcoin miner's reward by half, which occurs roughly every four years [1]. Bitcoin price chart and past studies showed that the halving event impacted Bitcoin price in specific manners that formed the Bitcoin halving cycle.In Figure 1, each cycle is segregated by vertical dash lines. Each of the three boxes within a cycle represents the Bitcoin bull market, bear market, and stagnation, respectively. By examining the Bitcoin price chart illustrated in Figure 1, it can be seen that a Bitcoin halving cycle typically consists of three stages: a one-year bull market, followed by a one-year bear market, followed by a two-year stagnation. During the one-year bull market, Bitcoin surpasses its previous high to achieve a new all-time high, per Meynkhard's [1] findings and has stood the test of time as of the time of this writing. It can also be seen in Figure 1 that Bitcoin is in its third halving cycle and has completed its one-year bull market. Therefore, Bitcoin is expected to be in the one-year bear market stage as of the time of this writing.There are specific sequences of events during each of the three stages of a Bitcoin halving cycle. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the five sequences of events consistently taking place during a bear market in Bitcoin's past two halving cycles. Below are the five sequences of events:Occurrence of reversal pattern at an all-time high;Followed by a 50% crash from the all-time high;Followed by a recovery back to 20% away from the all-time high;Followed by a 70% crash from the all-time high;Eventually bottoming out at 85% from the all-time high.The Bitcoin halving cycle suggests that Bitcoin price movement follows specific sequences, and is independent of other assets. This has significant implications for Bitcoin properties, encompassing its risk profile, volatility dynamics, safe haven properties, and hedge properties. For instance, Bitcoin should be negatively correlated to the stock market to exhibit safe haven and hedge properties according to the framework proposed by Baur and McDermott [2]. However, Bitcoin halving cycle implies independence (no correlation) of stock market movements. Given the predictability of the Bitcoin price movement, Bitcoin could exhibit time-varying properties that might not be inherent. Furthermore, given the distinctiveness of the three stages within a cycle, there could be certain volatility dynamics that are specific to each stage. While the Bitcoin halving cycle may impact Bitcoin safe haven, hedge properties, and volatility dynamics, these findings may not hold significance without significant industrial and institutional exposures and interests. Bitcoin is rapidly gaining recognition as an investment vehicle at the retail, institutional, and federal levels. The deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Li Bo, acknowledged Bitcoin as an investment alternative [3]. The first two Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), were approved in Canada and launched in February 2021. In an interview with CNBC in 2021, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global income, revealed that BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers, has entered the Bitcoin space [4].Many significant events also occurred in early 2021, suggesting the beginning of the increasing industrial adoption of Bitcoin. These events include big corporations accepting or facilitating payments via Bitcoin, S&P500 companies buying billions of dollars worth in Bitcoin, approval of the first-ever Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), and the world's largest asset management company entering the Bitcoin space [4]. Additionally, Apple Pay officially announced support of payments via Bitcoin in February 2021, while Google Pay and Samsung Pay have plans to support payments via Bitcoin in Q1 2021. According to SEC Filings, in January 2021, Tesla Inc., an S&P500 company, purchased USD 1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin for diversification and returned maximization of cash not required to maintain operating liquidity. Tesla Inc. also added that it expects to accept Bitcoin for payments soon.An aspect of industrial adoption is reflected by the rapid expansion in the Bitcoin supply chain. One component of the supply chain is the Bitcoin mining operation. Several well-known Bitcoin mining companies are Bitfarms, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital Holdings. In May 2020, Bitfarms announced the acquisition of 6600 miners, costing an estimated ~USD 43 million. A company's Bitcoin mining capacity is measured in hast rate per second (H/s), and Bitfarm's acquisition of 6600 miners will increase its mining capacity to 2.5 EH/s. Bitfarms stated that the company aims to achieve 8 EH/s by the end of 2022, implying that the company would be required to invest an estimated ~USD 80 mil before 2022 to achieve that milestone. Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Holdings, and other mining companies are also aggressively expanding their operations. Another aspect of industrial adoption is the emergence of crypto-asset exchanges and institutional trading volume. For example, Coinbase went public on 14 April 2021, at a valuation of ~USD 65 billion. It is the second world's largest crypto exchange after Binance. In addition, Coinbase reported that institutional trading volume was double that of retail trading volume in Q1 2021, citing that institutional interest has surpassed retail traders' [5]. With other major crypto exchanges, such as Gemini, also planning to go public, more capital will be invested into Bitcoin and its supply chain.Firstly, the extensive industrial and institutional adoption suggests that the importance of Bitcoin risk assessment is becoming apparent as more capital is being risked into Bitcoin and its supply chain. According to Ark Invest [6], Bitcoin would be lifted to ~USD 400,000 per coin if institutions allocate 5% of their funds to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's drastic increase in adoption suggests that its role may go beyond that of the medium of payment or store of value to a hedge against the stock market.Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold [7], and this comparison is apt as gold can be used as a hedge against many stock markets [8]. The notion of Bitcoin as digital gold is echoed by prolific portfolio manager Cathie Wood of ARK Invest. Two common properties of gold are being a safe haven and a hedge against the stock market and economic turmoil [2,9,10]. However, Bitcoin's role in this context is highly disputed. Some previous studies regarded Bitcoin as a speculative asset based on transaction data [11,12], while others believe that Bitcoin exhibits safe haven properties and diversification benefits [13,14], implying that the safe haven property of both Bitcoin is dependent on markets, market conditions, time horizon, and other factors such as government intervention and market participant reactions to market events [15,16,17,18]. Moreover, the properties of Bitcoin and gold could begin to interrelate. There may be signs that funds are flowing out of gold to the Bitcoin [19]. A recent contrasting finding suggests that gold did not exhibit safe haven properties against one of the US stock indices (S&P500) during the COVID-19 pandemic [17]. As a result, there might be a possibility that Bitcoin is displacing gold as a safe haven asset amidst the rising momentum of its adoption.Secondly, the stages and sequences of events in the Bitcoin halving cycle suggest that there may be the existence of regimes in Bitcoin volatility dynamics during each stage or sequence of events. A deeper open problem suggested by past studies [20] is the lack of a fundamental approach to assessing the value and risk of Bitcoin. The potential existence of regimes that are associated with different stages in the Bitcoin halving cycle will only add to the challenges of Bitcoin risk assessment. For instance, Value-at-risk (VaR) is one of the statistical measurements that assess Bitcoin volatility over a specific time frame by determining Bitcoin probability and severity of losses. Since VaR is sensitive toward volatility, regime changes can cause the VaR computed throughout low volatility to understate the actual risk level. Aside from the potential existence of regimes associated with the Bitcoin cycle, black-swan events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can also result in the same effect.The lack of a fundamental approach to Bitcoin risk assessment also has another set of significant implications for Altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH). Agosto and Cafferata [20] examined the co-explosivity in the crypto market and the interdependencies of crypto prices. The authors found high interdependence in the crypto market and that the Bitcoin explosive periods also coincide with the Altcoins'. This finding also aligns with other recent notable studies [21,22,23]. For instance, Bitcoin is found to be negatively related to Ripple (XRP), and this negative relationship is amplified during bubble periods. The interdependence between cryptocurrency prices, such as the Bitcoin–Ripple relationship, is found to be related to the function of the cryptocurrencies.In short, due to the extent of Bitcoin's impact on the wider crypto market, it is even more essential to access the Bitcoin risk assessment (VaR) under specific contexts (or regimes). Limited past studies considered the Bitcoin risk assessment (VaR) in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a spike in the USA's money supply, and a drastic increase in industrial and institutional participation in Bitcoin and Bitcoin supply chain. Furthermore, Bitcoin completed its second halving cycle in May 2020 and entered its third cycle.Ardia, Bluteau, and Rüede [24] found that regime changes existed in the Bitcoin GARCH volatility dynamics between 19 August 2011, and 2 March 2018. The authors accounted for regime changes in Bitcoin volatility using regime-switching GARCH models, such as the Markov Switching GARCH (MSGARCH) model. The authors found that regime-switching GARCH models suited Bitcoin volatility better than a single-regime GARCH based on Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and VaR forecasting. Maciel [25] also reported similar findings during this period and showed that regime-switching GARCH forecasted VaR",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Chan,Chen,Cheng,Jireh Yi-Le,Jireh Yi-Le Chan,Phoong,Seuk Wai,Seuk Wai Phoong,Seuk Yen,Wai Khuen",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/mathematics/mathematics-11-00698/article_deploy/html/images/mathematics-11-00698-g001-550.jpg?1675068165,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,7.0268655,312e0a29777b533e4722e044997362da

(TSX-V: CBIT; OTCQX: CBTTF) ('Cathedra' or the 'Company'), a Bitcoin company that develops and operate","February 06, 2023 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(Block Height: 775,225) – Cathedra Bitcoin Inc. (TSX-V: CBIT; OTCQX: CBTTF) ('Cathedra' or the 'Company'), a Bitcoin company that develops and operates world-class bitcoin mining infrastructure, is pleased to provide the following updates with respect to its diversified bitcoin mining operations.



On February 3, 2023, the Company entered into a hosting agreement under which it will deploy the last of its new machines, consisting of 490 Bitmain Antminer S19J Pro and 50 Bitmain Antminer S19 XP machines, at a third-party data center in Kentucky. Under the terms of the hosting agreement, which lasts for an initial term of 12 months, the Company will pay a fixed rate of US$0.07 per kilowatt hour, plus 10% of gross bitcoin revenue produced by the hosted machines. The Company expects the machines to be deployed by mid-February 2023.

Upon deployment of these machines at the Kentucky site and the 773 S19J Pro machines the Company previously announced it will be deploying at its new leased facility in Washington, the Company expects its diversified bitcoin mining operations to realize active hash rate of at least 378 PH/s, an approximately 53% increase from its current active hash rate of 247 PH/s, at a blended average efficiency of 29.7 joules per terahash.

Management Commentary

'We are delighted to have secured capacity for all of our new machines in a capital efficient manner. Last year we were forced to adapt to historically challenging bitcoin mining conditions on the fly, and I am proud of the flexibility and creativity our team demonstrated in finding homes for these machines.

'Upon completing these final deployments, our active fleet will consist of over 4,400 latest-generation machines producing over 378 PH/s of hash rate using underclocked settings to maximize our operating margins. We will have delivered hash rate growth of approximately 425% since new management joined the Company in Q4 2021 (with hash rate of approximately 72 PH/s), compared to 103% hash rate growth for the bitcoin network over the same period.

'With these final hosting agreements secured, we are excited to begin looking toward the future once more,' remarked AJ Scalia, Chief Executive Officer of Cathedra Bitcoin.

This paper applies the multivariate GARCH models to investigate the role of Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven for ASEAN+6 stock markets compared to gold. We used daily data for the dates 2 January 2017–20 January 2023, covering the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical findings provide compelling evidence of cross-market shock and volatility transmission between stock returns and Bitcoin returns in both directions. Therefore, the dynamics of Bitcoin returns significantly influence the volatility of stock returns, and the relationship also holds in reverse. All diagonal element estimations are statistically significant for both periods, as shown by the findings of the return and volatility spillovers between the returns of gold and the ASEAN+6 stock market. For most ASEAN+6 equity markets evaluated, Bitcoin and gold are not safe havens, and their inclusion increases the portfolio downside risk.

Global financial technology is experiencing unprecedented exponential growth. Financial technology continues to reshape traditional financial services by not only making transactions faster, easier, and less expensive but also by providing more options for investment and portfolio diversification through an increase in the market capitalization of assets. These assets include stocks, bonds, derivatives, offshore assets, commodities, and real estate, with each asset investment offering different returns and risks. Generally, high-risk investments could offer higher rates of return, and there are more than a thousand types of this investment on the market—one being Bitcoin. Bitcoin, developed by a programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, is considered the original 'cryptocurrency' (Pyo and Lee 2020). Cryptocurrency is traded at the value of that currency on the internet, does not have a physical form, and has become popular among investors worldwide.Blockchain technology has advanced significantly over the last ten years and has opened various channels for technical advancement. One of the blockchain innovations that has contributed to the growth of the financial market and received the most incredible attention is cryptocurrency (Hsu et al. 2021; Katsiampa 2019; Yarovaya and Zięba 2022). Unlike traditional finance, it provides a transactional channel without needing to be processed through a central bank or financial intermediaries, called decentralized networks. Cryptocurrency is also secured by cryptography, making it virtually impossible to double-spend or counterfeit. Due to its low transaction costs, peer-to-peer nature, worldwide reach, and lack of political interference, cryptocurrency is mainly used as an alternative payment method. It has recently acquired popularity as an investment asset. Moreover, it is traded through a central network where information is collected for various transactions (Bouri et al. 2019b; Vardar and Aydogan 2019).In 2017, there was a massive global fundraising called an initial coin offering (ICO), which is similar to an initial public offering (IPO) in the stock market. However, it will raise money (Fisch 2019). Funds for digital tokens are coins that can be purchased or exchanged for digital currency. Currently, many investors are interested and invest their money in these cryptocurrencies, a practice called cryptocurrency trading. However, recently, countries such as the United States and China have enacted laws to regulate the trade of cryptocurrencies. This illustrates the influence cryptocurrencies have on investment (Ram 2019). In the cryptocurrency trading market, various types of cryptocurrencies have been established. The most popular are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, BNB, USD Coin, XRP, Binance USD, Cardano, Dogecoin, and Solana. Bitcoin is the best-performing cryptocurrency, with a total market capitalization of over USD 438.01 billion, the capitalization has increased between November 2022 and January 2023 from around USD 303.33 billion with a growth rate of almost 44% which is expected to climb further (CoinMarketCap 2023). In addition, many well-known online stores such as Microsoft, Expedia, and Shopify accept payments using Bitcoin, which makes it a reliable currency. Ethereum is second after Bitcoin, with a market capitalization of over USD 200.16 billion, and is steadily becoming more popular (CoinMarketCap 2023).The possibility for quick returns has made the cryptocurrency market an appealing target for many investors in recent years (Nguyen et al. 2022). Although there are several different types of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is undoubtedly the most popular worldwide. In terms of other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has maintained its top spot for the past ten years, with 42% of the total capitalization of all crypto assets. Additionally, during the past ten years, the Bitcoin market has developed significantly and overgrown. Bitcoin has progressively established a reputation as a crucial hedge in the global financial system (Kumar et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2021; Yarovaya and Zięba 2022; Zhang et al. 2021). Due to its distinct anti-government characteristics and autonomy from a sovereign authority, Bitcoin is regarded as a remedy for unstable markets (Sensoy et al. 2021). However, the connection between Bitcoin and stock markets has grown more significant than before during COVID-19 (Goodell and Goutte 2021).The COVID-19 epidemic began in China at the end of December 2019 and spread fast, reaching every country in the world in a few months. As of 20 January 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there had been roughly 663.640 million confirmed illnesses and 6.713 million fatalities (WHO 2023). Governments have continued to enact various lockdown measures such as a combination of stay-at-home orders, travel bans, closing schools, and nonessential business restrictions on public and private gatherings, despite the destructive effect gradually diminishing as the scope of vaccination increases. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a devastating loss of life, it has also contributed to a global economic depression, and its repercussions are still being felt. Following the epidemic, there have been varied volatilities on the international stock markets. The world's financial markets have experienced precipitous drops due to this unprecedented shock. Along with the stock markets, COVID-19 also had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency markets, with the majority of cryptocurrencies losing half of their value (Balcilar et al. 2022; Banerjee et al. 2022; Sui et al. 2022).The COVID-19 epidemic has increased unpredictability and investment risk in global financial markets. In these situations, investors look for ways to lower their investment risk and get the best portfolio diversification by including new financial assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). This is because gold (GLD) failed to maintain its historical position as a potential safe haven throughout the time after the Global Financial Crisis. Shahzad et al. (2019) attributed the weakening of gold's ability to hedge to the speeding up of the financialization of the commodity market and the way gold prices have responded to various recent occurrences. Figure 1 shows the progression of the prices of Bitcoin and gold between 2017 and 2023. Prices are displayed on a logarithmic scale to show periods of significant growth for the two markets. Between the two assets, some differences can be seen. The peak of the Bitcoin price is seen in November 2021, whereas the peak of the gold price is seen in March 2022. This distinction can cover different hedging opportunities for stock markets. The possibility of hedging between assets is, in fact, influenced by the strength and direction of their correlation. The dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and gold prices and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus six (ASEAN+6) stock indices, however, varies as a result of the divergences in their prices. As a result, their capacity to hedge ASEAN+6 stocks may differ.This is a brief history of the ASEAN+6 and its stock market. First, in 2015, the ten ASEAN members—Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar—expanded their economic ties to the ASEAN+6, a grouping of 16 nations that consists of the ten ASEAN members as well as six additional countries from the Asia-Pacific region—China, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. The 16 members of the organization represent almost 30% of the world's population (2.2 billion people) and 30% of its GDP (USD 26.2 trillion). As a result, it now has the largest economy in history (World Bank 2022). Moreover, ASEAN+6 is a vibrant market and a popular site for investments. Economic growth has been accelerating quickly. A key factor in the success of economic development is co-movement, which Sethapramote (2015) shows to be a prominent pattern. The study results indicate that ASEAN nations have higher correlation levels than other nations. Additionally, the bond market in ASEAN nations is more integrated than outside of the group (Chan et al. 2018).As a result, several earlier studies have compared the potential value of the two assets as a hedge and safe haven for other financial and commodities assets. Hsu et al. (2021) examined the volatility of three major cryptocurrencies concerning 10 top currencies and two forms of gold prices, gold spot and gold futures, based on current research. The data suggest that there are significant covolatility spillover effects between cryptocurrency and currency or gold markets, especially throughout the research period and amid the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The capabilities of cryptocurrency are time-varying and related to economic uncertainty or shocks. There are significant differences between normal and extreme markets concerning the capabilities of cryptocurrency as a diversifier, a hedge, or a safe haven. This result supports the findings of Paule-Vianez et al. (2020), who discovered that Bitcoin's returns and volatility increase during more uncertain times, just like gold, showing that Bitcoin acts not only as a means of exchange but also shows characteristics of investment assets, specifically of safe havens. These findings are significant to investors because they allow Bitcoin to be considered as a tool to protect savings and diversify portfolios during economic turmoil. However, Conlon and McGee (2020) found that Bitcoin did not act as a safe haven, instead decreasing in price in lockstep with the stock price as the crisis developed.The explosion of cryptocurrency has given rise to the relevant literature on the subject. For example, the Bitcoin price discovery process has been studied by Ciaian et al. (2016), Takaishi and Adachi (2018), Turner and Irwin (2018), Ram (2019), and Duan et al. (2021). In addition, the presence of calendar anomalies in cryptocurrencies has been examined by Aharon and Qadan (2019) and Caporale and Plastun (2019). Some studies aim to contribute to the literature by investigating the relationship between Bitcoin price and other factors such as volume, media sentiment, and investor attention (Bouri et al. 2019a; Gemici and Polat 2019; Karalevicius et al. 2018; Li et al. 2021), while the volatility of cryptocurrency price returns has been considered by Dyhrberg (2016), Ardia et al. (2019), Katsiampa et al. (2019), and Fakhfekh and Jeribi (2020), among others. Nonetheless, while many studies have evaluated the efficiency of the Bitcoin market compared to stock markets (Al-Yahyaee et al. 2018; Mensi et al. 2020; Mokni et al. 2020; Vardar and Aydogan 2019), the relationship between Bitcoin and stock markets remains relatively under-explored.This paper intends to study the role of Bitcoin as a hedge and/or safe haven for ASEAN+6 stock markets while comparing it with gold. Thus, we continue with a few research-related concerns. In order to determine the best-fitting model, we first choose to evaluate the stylized facts of Bitcoin return. Second, we compare the outcomes with the dynamics of the gold price as we investigate the dynamic and nonlinear co-movement of Bitcoin with ASEAN+6 equity indices. Thirdly, we look at managerial implications concerning portfolio layouts and hedging tactics.In three different ways, the study adds to the body of knowledge already available on asset management. First, no one has been interested in the dynamic relationship between Bitcoin and ASEAN+6 stock markets, despite the fact that a small number of recent papers have been developed to examine the role of Bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven for conventional financial markets (Zhang et al. 2021) except Balcilar et al. (2022). However, that study investigated the volatility connectedness among emerging equity markets and seven cryptocurrencies since the study does not consider the time-varying co-movement between assets. Second, this study employed the dynamic conditional correlation–generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC–GARCH) model of Engle (",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Chancharat,Parichat Sinlapates,Sinlapates,Sriwong,Surachai Chancharat,Tanit Sriwong",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/jrfm/jrfm-16-00103/article_deploy/html/images/jrfm-16-00103-g001-550.jpg?1675853032,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,6.1091685,94e255dfe1c125365fa2ac318a7da8ce

Its nearest rival, Ethereum, was down by 2.23 percent and is currently priced at $1,655.96 at the time of writing this article (1100 IST).

The offspin of the ultimate NFT collection has now been released on the ultimate blockchain of Bitcoin.
 
The
 Ordinals
 protocol, which has been originally introduced to crypto in 2014, has gained momentum along with the market interest two weeks ago when the option of creating NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain was revealed. The main idea of such NFTs is that they are completely stored on the blockchain, which is possible thanks to the updates of SegWit (2017) and Taproot (2021). Ordinals was also the first protocol to create a Bitcoin NFT. The latest & hottest NFT collection named
 the Ordinal Punks
 - inspired by the legendary CryptoPunks - has already appeared on the marketplace, with the Ordinal Punk NFT #620 being sold for 9.5 BTC (~$215,000). 
 
The next one to have their say within the rapid bloom of Bitcoin NFTs  is BAYC Bitcoin NFT, a which is extremely popular with celebrities and brands - Eminem for example has recently joined the list of BAYC holders, he purchased his monkey for the staggering 123.4 ETH (~$380,000) and made it his avatar on Instagram, other celebrity owners being Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, and Jimmy Faloon.
 
BAYC BITCOIN NFT
 is a collection of 10,000 original monkeys with unique Bitcoin traits, as well as 10 ultra rare signature NFT monkeys in Satoshi masks. The mint of the collection is set to kick off on February, 17 at 11:00 UTC. The users who are lucky enough to secure a mint will become the owners of a BAYC NFT for a flat price of 0.01 BTC. Given the success of the previous BAYC collections, there is good evidence that BAYC BITCOIN NFT will perform just as well.
 
To make it even more compelling, as soon as the BAYC Bitcoin NFT collection is 100% minted, the user to have minted the BTC BAYC #910 will receive a 1 BTC offer from the team in exchange for it.
'This is an exciting time for the world of bitcoin and NFTs, the potential of this and other similar projects designed and implemented via the Bitcoin blockchain is huge. The level of interest in the Bitcoin NFTs continues its exponential growth despite the current fees, proving that there is a huge demand for reunion with the technological roots of the blockchain technology', says Mike Fritz, CTO at Baycbitcoin. - 'The NFT market is booming again, and this immense interest might be the best indicator of the hatching bull market'.

By Jasmine Anand
: 
Praia Bitcoin Brazil, a Bitcoin education initiative, is planning to host its inaugural Bitcoin Carnival in Jericoacoara, a small fishing village in Brazil's Ceara.
This social project aims to build a sustainable circular economy for the vulnerable, impoverished, and unbanked citizens in the country.
In fact, similar to that developed by El Salvador, Bitcoin Beach Brazil will help in accelerating Bitcoin's adoption as a form of payment and savings for neighbourhood businesses and schools located in the interior areas of Brazil. It also involves educating people on how to use Bitcoin as well as offering a roadmap for businessmen for the acceptance of crypto payments in the said geographical region.

Interestingly, this initiative has attracted a lot of attention since its inception. Blockchain for Humanity has awarded the project as the leading 'social project with the greatest impact in the world' during a presentation held in Argentina last year. 
It is pointed out that the above-said Bitcoin Beach Brazil project has been created by Fernando Motolese. As per reports, he intends to help more communities across the globe with the integration of the Bitcoin standard via a book titled, 'Bitcoin Standard Circular Economy', which he is currently working on. 
Know the other Bitcoin-driven community projects
Blockchain technology plays a vital role in various socio-humanitarian causes as its utility is boundless and beyond decentralising the world of finance.
One such community-driven Bitcoin initiative is Built With Bitcoin (BWB). It is a non-profit humanitarian organisation that lays a strong emphasis on community development. It aims to improve the physical, mental, environmental, and financial health of those in need and is devoted to establishing equitable opportunities for impoverished people by way of making provisions for clean water, sustainable farming, access to quality education, and also providing general humanitarian support.

The Company's Q4 2022 revenue increased to $18.2 million compared to $14.4 million in the previous year, representing an improvement of 27% year over year. Gross Profit also increased to $1.2 million in Q4 2022, compared to $0.9 million in the same time period in the prior year, an improvement of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA improved to negative $0.2 million in Q4 2022 compared to negative $2.3 million in the prior year and improvement of 90%.
 
In 2021 the Company recorded a one-time transaction of $22.0 million which was not expected to recur. When normalized to remove this transaction, 2021 revenue was $77.6 million. The Company has revenue of $66.7 million in 2022 representing a 14% decline over the normalized revenue in the prior year. Gross Profit was $5.1 million in 2021 and $4.4 million in 2022, representing a 14% decline year over year. This decline in revenue and gross profit is attributed to a significant decline in the sentiment of the overall bitcoin market. Notably, the Company achieved a 7% Gross Margin in 2022 compared to a 5% Gross Margin in 2021.
 
""The much improved financial performance seen in the latter half of 2022 is a demonstration of our effective strategy to significantly reduce costs, while maintaining strong revenues in the year,"" said Luke Thibodeau, CFO ""We are committed to maintaining this positive financial momentum, and are excited to watch how the growth of our new online product offering creates value for our users and our investors.'
 
 
The graph represents our quarterly adjusted EBITDA over the last 6 quarters. The quarter ending in December 2022 on the right shows a significant improvement over the same period the previous year and the management team is looking for this metric to continue improving.
 
Convertible debenture financing 
 
In February 2023, Bitcoin Well issued a secured convertible debenture for up to $0.7 million to refinance a portion of the existing bitcoin denominated debt.
 
At the option of the holder, the principal amount of the Convertible Debenture is convertible into common shares of Bitcoin Well (the 'Common Shares') at a conversion price of $0.15 per Common Share, subject to TSXV review and acceptance. Bitcoin Well has the right to require the holder to convert any portion of the principal amount into Common Shares at any time where the Current Market Price of the Common Shares equals or exceeds $0.30 for a period of ten (10) consecutive Trading Days. The Convertible Debenture bears interest at a rate of 8% + Bank of Canada policy interest rate per annum and matures on February 16, 2026.
 
'2022 was a transformational year for Bitcoin Well. The market has forced us to find the balance between growth and sustainability and I'm very happy with the results so far. While we still have work to do, our Bitcoin ATM business unit cash flows are stable while we continue to develop and grow our hyper-scalable growth business unit. Our financial improvement in the latter half of the year is a testament to the capabilities of our team and we are marching into 2023 with more momentum than ever before.' said Adam O'Brien, the Founder and CEO of the Company.

88,Hello Pets Depict an Open Entertainment Ecosystem and Aim to be the Next Disney in Web3 – Sponsored Bitcoin News,Sponsored Posts,2023-02-15 00:00:24,date,https://news.bitcoin.com/hello-pets-depict-an-open-entertainment-ecosystem-and-aim-to-be-the-next-disney-in-web3/,bitcoin.com,Hello Pets team is building an open entertainment ecosystem where the community can join in the storytelling and art creation of shared IPs. Starting from,"Hello Pets team is building an open entertainment ecosystem where the community can join in the storytelling and art creation of shared IPs. Starting from their own adorable pet characters, Hello Pets also actively 
incorporate
 external NFT characters into their story and invite the holders and communities to create amazing content together. 
The Hello Pets team 
believes this is a paradigm shift that can fully unleash the potential of the community. Their ultimate goal is to be the next Disney in Web3.


How will Web3 Revolutionize the Entertainment Industry?


In the traditional entertainment world, when an artist wants to 
incorporate
 well-known IPs (e.g. the classic characters from Disney, Nintendo, and Marvel) into her new story, she has to pay a heavy IP authorization fee and dedicate a significant amount of time communicating, negotiating, and signing contracts with the companies who own the IPs. 


However, in the NFT world, in most cases all she needs to do is to purchase an NFT. Then she can use the characters freely to create derivative works and integrate it into her own brand to create additional value. This is a win-win situation for both parties. Firstly, she can use the IP to add content and fun to her brand; secondly, she can attract the fans of this IP to become aware of her brand, bringing her a larger audience; thirdly, the derivative works she created also increase the exposure of this IP and thus increase its value.




Therefore, Hello Pets team decides to take the opportunity of the new IP licensing mechanism of the NFT world, and build the entertainment ecosystem of the future. 


Starting the journey with Adorable Pet Characters


Hello Pets aim to reach the mainstream market and build a recognizable web3 brand through their core characters. Adorable pets are universally loved by people of all ages and backgrounds, and bring people a lot of joy in life. With this in mind, they design a set of pet characters that are able to emotionally connect with people, and are easy to use for creating derivative works in many forms of art.




Incorporating External NFT Characters into Hello Pets World


Hello Pets go a step beyond traditional entertainment companies by taking advantage of the efficient IP licensing mechanism in the NFT world. They can easily integrate the characters from external NFT collections by holding them and inviting their holders to participate in the content creation of Hello Pets world.




Covering Both Digital and Physical Worlds


By leveraging the latest technologies of game engines, AI, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, 3D printing and many more, the products of Hello Pets will not only cover digital applications like movies, games, metaverse, music, and more, but also extend to physical applications like lego-like toys, fashion products, home decor and many others.




Unleashing the Creative Power of the Community


Another thing that sets Hello Pets apart from traditional entertainment companies is that the content is not only created by the team, but also by the community and the masses.


The team believes that a single content-producing company cannot compete with those that fully utilize the collective power of the community, because the creativity of the masses is infinite. In their opinion, the next ‘Disney' should be a decentralized entertainment ecosystem where the community participates in the storytelling, and they believe that now is the beginning of the revolution. So the team is working to create a world where the art is created by the community, for the community, and the value generated is shared among the participants in the ecosystem.

Crypto price in India on 21 February 
By Nidhi Bhardwaj
: 
Top cryptocurrencies on Tuesday noticed gains. The largest cryptocurrency by market value, Bitcoin was up by 2 percent over the last 24 hours to trade at $24,923.42. At the time of writing this article (0930 IST), the value of Ethereum was up by 1.09 percent to currently trade at $1,703.47.

You can break that up in different months, so you know 2018, 2014, 2022, we had like eight or nine red months, but in the recovery years, it's split more or less into half and half,"" said Benjamin Cowen, founder & CEO at Into The Cryptoverse.

After over a year of preparation and restructuring, decentralized and privacy-enabled AI organization Federated Learning Consortium (FLC)","PRESS RELEASE. 
After over a year of preparation and restructuring, decentralized and privacy-enabled AI organization Federated Learning Consortium (FLC) is set to launch as a for-profit research consortium in Hong Kong, China, shifting from a previously non-profit approach. FLC is set to be led by founding keystone members – blockchain technology platform Phoenix and leading China-based consumer data and AI company APEX Technologies.


FLC's vision is centered on researching, developing, and promoting cutting-edge technologies surrounding federated AI, including federated learning, blockchain-enabled AI, multi-party computation (MPC), and TEE (trusted execution environment). The organization will be particularly interested in combining large-dataset deep learning technologies, such as reinforcement learning, with highly performant infrastructures using GPU computing using a decentralized/federated approach.


Organizational membership will be open to AI related technology firms, blockchain firms, and system integrators – the goal is to be able to provide holistic, implementable, and highly performant solutions for the broader market, focused initially on China and Asia. Through internal partnerships and joint research projects, organizations will be able to deliver new technology solutions that were not possible on a standalone basis,


Individual membership is also available for academics and industry experts. Currently FLC already has an initial roster of machine learning and federated learning experts from leading China-based firms such as HuaAT (华院数据), FuData (富数科技) , and Tencent.


FLC will be focused on developing technology solutions for various different verticals, including but not limited to retail, financial services, automotive, asset management, IoT, and government.

1.4. canada - 35.49/100

1.5. nigeria - 25.31/100 2. where do the other countries place on the list?

Cryptocurrency betting experts cryptobetting.org combined Google Trends searches across the globe for countries searching for Bitcoin, alongside the number of Bitcoin ATMs in each country per 100,000 people and data on Crypto ownership per country.

These metrics were then combined into an index to allocate each country a rating out of 100 to reveal which countries are most interested in Bitcoin.

The United States ranks as the most Bitcoin-obsessed country in the world, with a total score of 54.95. The country boasts a high number of bitcoin atms , clearly indicating the growing interest in the cryptocurrency.

In the United States, around 13.22% of the population owns cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin being the most popular choice among these individuals. The large number of Bitcoin ATMs, along with the high rate of ownership, places the United States among the top countries in terms of Bitcoin popularity globally.

The interest and adoption of Bitcoin in the United States is a testament to the growing acceptance of digital currencies as a legitimate form of investment and financial instrument.

El Salvador is a unique and prominent player in the world of Bitcoin, with a total score of 46.19. The country ranks second globally on the scale of countries with the highest interest in Bitcoin, making it a standout destination for digital currency enthusiasts.

What sets El Salvador apart is that it is one of only two countries in the world where Bitcoin is considered legal tender. This distinction could explain the high level of interest in the country, as evidenced by the highest global Google searches for Bitcoin originating from El Salvador.

The country is also the leader in Bitcoin popularity in Latin America, with 212 Bitcoin ATMs available for use. The combination of being a legal tender and the large number of ATMs makes El Salvador a hub for Bitcoin activity and a prime example of the growing acceptance of digital currencies.

Vietnam has positioned itself as a leader in terms of interest and adoption of Bitcoin, with a score of 35.69. Vietnam has the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership globally at 26%, while it also has 8 Bitcoin ATMs, making it easier for individuals to access and use the cryptocurrency.

Vietnam's strong interest in Bitcoin has made it the most popular country for digital currency in Asia. This high level of ownership and accessibility highlights Bitcoin as a legitimate form of investment in Vietnam and the wider Asia region.

Canada has a strong and growing interest in Bitcoin, with a score of 35.49 therefore placing fourth on the list. Canada has a large number of Bitcoin ATMs, with 2,645 ATMs available for use, and has the second highest number of Bitcoin ATMs per 100,000 people.

In Canada, 4.1% of the population owns cryptocurrency, with the majority being Bitcoin. This high number of ATMs and the growing ownership of Bitcoin contribute towards a total score of 35.49 out of 100.

Nigeria is a leading player in the world of bitcoin , with a score of 25.31, helping it rank as the fifth country most interested in Bitcoin. The country is the leader in Bitcoin popularity in Africa, and also ranks second globally for Google Trends searches for Bitcoin, further emphasizing the high level of interest and recognition of the digital currency in the country.

Switzerland places sixth on the list and is the European country with the highest interest in Bitcoin with a score of 19.14 out of a 100, rounding out the top ten is the Philippines with 18.71, India with 17.08, Venezuela with 16.88 and lastly Austria with 16.31. The United Kingdom places 20th on the list with a score of 12.19.

Commenting on the findings, a spokesperson for cryptobetting.org said:'Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency across the world and this study highlights its immense popularity, with countries from different continents placing on the list, emphasizing Bitcoin's global interest.

'While it was expected that the United States would place first in the study, it is interesting to see that El Salvador places second. This can be explained by the fact that El Salvador became the first country in the world to use Bitcoin as a legal tender.'",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-03/02/V_6acfaimage_story.jpeg,False,,8.470097,ffe43ecf2d7748facee1ebb3cc484241

GameSwift has announced the open alpha version of its all-in-one Platform for playing and building web3 games. It features the GameSwift ID,"PRESS RELEASE. 
GameSwift
 has announced the open alpha version of its all-in-one Platform for playing and building web3 games. It features the GameSwift ID – a revolutionary passwordless sign-on system with an in-built wallet that offers seamless web3 onboarding for games and players. In addition to this groundbreaking feature, the company has garnered attention for its strategic partnerships with Polygon and Casper Network, which aimed to accelerate the mass adoption of web3 games.


The newly released GameSwift Platform and its Launcher and ID components create a comprehensive hub for gamers seeking an optimal web3 gaming experience. Thanks to this user-friendly and inclusive solution, even those without blockchain knowledge can enjoy playing web3 games.


Web3 Gaming: Onboarding Players Proves to be the Biggest Challenge


Web3 gaming is an exciting new frontier, but one of the industry's biggest challenges is onboarding new players. This is mainly because the requirements for web3 gaming can be daunting, particularly for mainstream gamers unfamiliar with blockchain technology.


For starters, finding quality information, navigating through different chains, and creating a crypto wallet can be complex and confusing, often leading to skepticism and holding players back from exploring the web3 world. To make matters worse, most wallet solutions available today are not designed with crypto newbies in mind. Storing passwords and seed phrases can be intimidating, and processing transactions without previous knowledge is nearly impossible.


For web3 gaming to achieve mass adoption, a new approach is needed: a gamer-friendly platform with a simple sign-in process that leverages universal logins from well-known services like Google or Facebook. This would allow web3 gaming projects to open doors for new and larger audiences while streamlining onboarding and enabling in-game transactions.


GameSwift's Solution to Overcoming the Challenges of Player Onboarding in Web3 Gaming


GameSwift Platform offers an easy and user-friendly way to discover and play web3 games without blockchain knowledge. With GameSwift ID, players can enjoy games without worrying about complicated processes. Enjoy a rich library of games with zero gas fees and cash-out rewards through bankcard payments. 




A rich list of web3 games is already available on the GameSwift Platform from launch day! The very first titles featured on GameSwift are StarHeroes, Kryxivia, Rocket Monsters, Rage Effect, Solcraft, Synergy Land, NetherLords, MotoDEX, Oyabun, Sollarion, Legends of Elysium, Lazy Soccer, Life Beyond, MetaBots, and Elementies Universe, including both current partnerships and yet-to-be-announced ones!


Game studios and developers can access product suites, SDKs, and infrastructure solutions to accelerate game adoption and tailor to player preferences. Critical data about their games can be accessed with upcoming updates, leading to industry success. Join the web3 gaming revolution with GameSwift today.


GameSwift's Launcher App


The GameSwift Platform also includes the new GameSwift Launcher app, a cross-platform app designed for fast game download, easy parallel installation, and automatic game updates. The Launcher ensures up-to-date game versions and secure game files and uses a dedicated DRM system. It offers improved security, high performance, and automatic updates for a hassle-free gaming experience. Additionally, the GameSwift Platform offers easy registration, login, password reset, player profile updates, wallet integration, and a full library of games with the ability to filter and add games to a wishlist. 


You can register for a new account 
here
. 


 Also, if you're a gaming studio in the web3 space and seeking the optimal environment to enhance your product's growth, you can submit an application 
here
 to integrate with GameSwift's platform and become a part of their community.

River and Bitcoin Magazine Announce Lightning Partnership to Drive the Adoption of Bitcoin

River now has direct integration into the new Bitcoin Magazine app, which allows users to create an account on River and buy Bitcoin.

Additionally, users will earn Bitcoin when they read an article on the Bitcoin Magazine app. This allows users to earn free satoshis for learning about the digital asset. These sats can be withdrawn using the Lightning Network to their River wallet, or another wallet of their choice.

While the broader crypto industry has suffered from bad actors in recent months, there are still innovative, mission-focused companies like River and Bitcoin Magazine that are working to cultivate a more fair and just financial system. This starts by increasing knowledge.

""We see River as one of the best exchanges in the world and the strongest partners for the Bitcoin Magazine app,"" says Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey.

Bitcoin is one of the most successful cryptocurrencies, and research on price predictions is receiving more attention. To predict Bitcoin price fluctuations better and more effectively, it is necessary to establish a more abundant index system and prediction model with a better prediction effect. In this study, a combined prediction model with twin support vector regression was used as the main model. Twenty-seven factors related to Bitcoin prices were collected. Some of the factors that have the greatest impact on Bitcoin prices were selected by using the XGBoost algorithm and random forest algorithm. The combined prediction model with support vector regression (SVR), least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR), and twin support vector regression (TWSVR) was used to predict the Bitcoin price. Since the model's hyperparameters have a great impact on prediction accuracy and algorithm performance, we used the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. The experimental results show that the combined model, XGBoost-WOA-TWSVR, has the best prediction effect, and the EVS score of this model is significantly better than that of the traditional statistical model. In addition, our study verifies that twin support vector regression has advantages in both prediction effect and computation speed.


 










 


Since the official birth of Bitcoin in 2009, it has attracted worldwide attention. As a cryptocurrency market representative, Bitcoin price fluctuation affects the stability and development of the world economy. The effective price prediction of Bitcoin at a low time cost is an important issue that investors and policy-makers urgently need to solve (e.g., [
1
,
2
]). Researchers have used traditional statistical methods and machine learning models to predict and analyze the price of Bitcoin. For example, Khedr et al. [
3
] summarized the research progress in the cryptocurrency price-prediction field from 2010 to 2020 and proposed gaps in existing research and prospects for related future research. Traditional statistical methods include Bayesian regression (e.g., [
1
,
2
]), logistic regression [
4
,
5
], linear regression [
6
], and autoregressive comprehensive moving average (ARIMA) (e.g., [
7
,
8
]). Machine learning models include support vector machines (SVMs) [
9
], random forest (RF) classifiers [
10
], artificial neural networks (ANNs) (e.g., [
11
,
12
,
13
]), and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) networks (e.g., [
14
,
15
]).
Further research has divided Bitcoin prices into separate periods of time. Chen Z et al. [
16
] divided Bitcoin price prediction into 5 min price prediction and daily price prediction models according to data characteristics. In the 5 min price prediction model, the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm was 67.2%, which is better than that of the traditional statistical methods. In daily price prediction, traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis have accuracy rates of about 66%, which is higher than those of machine learning models. Similarly, Mudassir M. et al. [
17
] used classification and prediction models, i.e., ANN, SVM, and LSTM, to study Bitcoin prices for 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. The results show that the accuracy of the classification model is higher than 60%, and the error percentage of the prediction model is lower than 




5


%




. Mallqui D.C. et al. [
18
] used machine learning technology to predict the direction, maximum value, minimum value, and closing price of the daily Bitcoin price. Compared to the original model, the accuracy of Mallqui's final model was improved by more than 




10


%




.
Current Bitcoin price prediction studies have the following two drawbacks. First, the selection of appropriate influencing factors and prediction models for Bitcoin prices is of great significance. How to choose the factors that affect the price of Bitcoin is a central issue. Yechen Zhu et al. [
19
] verified the impacts of various economic factors on the price of Bitcoin, and the research results show that the dollar index has the greatest impact on the price of Bitcoin, and the price of gold has the least impact. In addition to economic factors, user sentiment can also play a role in the price of Bitcoin. Based on a study of the impact of macroeconomic factors on the price of Bitcoin, Aggarwal A. et al. [
20
] creatively considered Twitter emotion as an influencing factor and found that Twitter emotion had a positive correlation with the price of Bitcoin. Based on the study of traditional determinants, Ciaian P. et al. [
21
] found that the attractiveness of Bitcoin represented by Wikipedia to investors and users significantly affected the change in the Bitcoin price. Kim Y.B. et al. [
22
] extracted all comments and responses posted in crypto-related online communities and rated them based on the positive or negative sentiments of the comments and responses. Based on the averaged one-dependence estimators, a prediction was made by a machine learning model. Three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple) were tested to verify the scientific nature and feasibility of the model.
Furthermore, Wei C. et al. [
23
] developed a two-stage machine learning model for predicting Bitcoin prices. In the first stage, an artificial neural network and random forest method were used to extract important economic and technical factors affecting the price of Bitcoin. In the second stage, LSTM, ARIMA, the SVR machine model, and the adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model were used to predict the price of Bitcoin. Finally, it is concluded that the prediction effect of LSTM was better than those of other prediction models. However, in it, the change in Bitcoin price is limited to the impacts of a particular category of factors, rather than a comprehensive consideration of all the influencing factors. At the same time, the multicollinearity of selection influencing factors is not considered in the establishment of the model, and a feature-selection stage is missing.
In this study, the XGBoost algorithm and random forest algorithm were used to select the influencing variables. Previous studies have shown that both the XGBoost and random forest algorithms are effective feature selection models (e.g., [
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
]). The comparison between the selected variable group and the original full variable group is shown in 
Section 4
. The XGBoost algorithm is a type of ensemble learning boosting system. The idea is to integrate many weak classifiers to form a strong classifier (e.g., [
28
,
29
]). The random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning bagging approach. It combines the ability to solve regression problems and classification problems. A random forest integrated multiple decision trees through the idea of ensemble learning and averaged the output of each decision tree to obtain the final output result in [
30
].
There are various types of Bitcoin price prediction models, but they do not remove the influence of model differences on prediction. In addition, the differences between the strengths and weaknesses of the prediction models were not considered in the different periods of the datasets, and the generalization abilities of the models were poor. Therefore, in this study, support vector regression (SVR), least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR), and twin support vector regression (TWSVR) were used as the main predictive models. TWSVR has good generalization, high prediction accuracy, relatively simple calculations, and good robustness to outliers (e.g., [
31
,
32
,
33
]). These three models all fit the data by establishing the prediction belt method, which solves the influence of model-type differences in the overall prediction to a certain extent. At the same time, the ARIMA model was set as the benchmark model and was compared with the main prediction model to obtain the best prediction model of Bitcoin price.
In addition, selecting a reasonable hyperparameter for the model can improve the accuracy of the prediction model (e.g., [
34
,
35
,
36
]). The intrinsic relationship between hyperparameters and prediction accuracy is very complex and unknown, which brings great challenges to the selection of hyperparameters. In this study, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were selected to optimize the hyperparameters of the models. Both algorithms are fast and effective community search algorithms.
The WOA is a new optimization algorithm inspired by whale hunting behavior (e.g., [
37
,
38
]). Whales are social animals and cooperate to drive and round up prey when hunting. The most important feature of the WOA is to simulate the hunting behavior of humpback whales with random individuals or optimal individuals and the bubble-net attack mechanism of a humpback whale with a spiral. The WOA performs a global search in the early stage and a local search in the late stage. The WOA seeks an optimal solution to the problem by mimicking the way whales hunt (e.g., [
37
,
39
]). The WOA randomly generates a group of whales, and the position of each whale represents a feasible solution. During a pod hunt, each whale behaves in two ways. During each iteration, each whale randomly chooses one of two behaviors to hunt. One behavior is where all whales move toward each other to surround prey. The other behavior is when whales swim in circles and blow bubbles to repel the prey. Each whale follows two rules of behavior until the best solution is found. Therefore, the WOA has the advantage of fast convergence while avoiding local optimization [
40
].
PSO is a random search algorithm based on group cooperation developed by simulating the foraging behavior of birds [
41
]. In PSO, the solution to each optimization problem is a bird in the search space, also known as a 'particle'. Each bird (particle) looks for food in the search space, that is, the optimal solution to the optimization problem in [
42
]. Each particle does not know exactly where the food is but can sense its general direction. Each particle carries on the next search in the direction it decides, records the position of each iteration during the search and shares it with other particles. Finally, in the process of continuous iteration, the specific location of the optimal solution is searched (e.g., [
43
,
44
,
45
]).
The major contributions in this paper are described as follows:
(a)
Expanding the factors that influence Bitcoin price movements. This article considers 27 influencing factors—that is, the impact of other cryptocurrencies on Bitcoin's price—and uses the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (F&G) as an indicator of the degree of user demand for Bitcoin. In this study, XGBoost and random forest models were used to select the influencing factors of the price of Bitcoin, the variables selected by the two methods were compared with the full variables in the prediction model, and the index system affecting the prediction of the Bitcoin price was obtained.
(b)
Three models, i.e., SVR, LSSVR, and TWSVR, were used as the main prediction models in this study. Since the prediction accuracies of SVR, LSSVR, and TWSVR are easily affected by the hyperparameters of the models, two optimization algorithms, i.e., WOA and PSO, were used in this study to optimize the hyperparameters of the prediction model.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The raw data of the Bitcoin price and its influencing factors are explained and interpreted in 
Section 2
. In 
Section 3
, we provide a detailed description of the prediction models and the optimization algorithm for the hyperparameters of the models. In 
Section 4
, feature selection is reported on the original data, and the combined prediction model is constructed and solved. 
Section 5
 provides a discussion on the prediction models and concludes this paper.
Figure 1
 plots the main processes of Bitcoin price prediction. It mainly includes four processes: data collection, data processing, feature selection, prediction model, and parameter optimization. We provide a detailed description of these four processes in the following sections.
This paper mainly studies the prediction of Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin prices have generally tended to rise over time, rising sharply from 2018 and peaking twice in March and November 2021. We selected relevant daily data from 1 January 2018 to 1 April 2022. The variation trend is shown in 
Figure 2
.
The price of Bitcoin is affected by the internal factors of cryptocurrency and external economic factors. The internal factors of cryptocurrency are divided into three secondary indices: Bitcoin-supply factors, Bitcoin-demand factors, and other cryptocurrency's prices. External economic factors are divided into three secondary indices: financial-indicator factors, macroeconomic factors, and exchange-rate factors. Twenty-seven factors were considered in this study. 
Figure 3
 summarizes the relevant influencing factors of the Bitcoin price.
Mining difficulty (MD) means the difficulty of successfully mining Bitcoin data blocks in transaction information, which represents the level of Bitcoin supply.
The Crypto Fear and Greed Index (F&G) analyzes the current sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Data levels range from 0 to 100. Zero means ""extreme fear"", while 100 means ""extreme greed"". It takes into account the volatility of Bitcoin price changes (25%), the current volume of Bitcoin trading (25%), market momentum, and the public's appreciation of Bitcoin (50%). The Crypto Fear and Greed Index represents public demand for Bitcoin.
Ethereum Price (ETH), Litecoin Price (LTC), Bitcoin Cash Price (BCH), and the USDT Price Index (USDT) are the prices of other types of cryptocurrencies, which indirectly affect the price fluctuations of Bitcoin.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations Index (NASDAQ), Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), and CBOE Volatility Index (VIXCLS) are important measures of the U.S. stock market volatility.
The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100) is an important measure of volatility in the UK stock market.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), Hang Seng Index (HSI), A/H share premium index (AHP), and Shanghai Securities Composite Index (SSEC) are important measure indices of volatility in China's stock market.
Gold price (GOLD) and silver price (SILVER) are important indicators to measure the price fluctuation of rare metals in the United States and are also macroeconomic factors affecting the Bitcoin price change.

118,The bitcoin bounce: what comes next?,Associated Press,2023-03-17 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/03/17/the-bitcoin-bounce-what-comes-next,ny1.com,"Markets this year are roiling, uncertainty abounds and the U.S. government has had to step in to rescue two large American banks in recent days","Markets this year are roiling, uncertainty abounds and the U.S. government has had to step in to rescue two large American banks in recent days. So why is bitcoin, considered among the riskiest bets of them all, rising so fast? 
 
Just months ago, all forms of cryptocurrency appeared to be going up in flames, with bitcoin plunging from almost $50,000 at the start of 2022, to less than $17,000 when 2023 rolled around.
 
Bitcoin has since soared more than 60% and it climbed another 8% Friday above $27,000, all in an era of mass layoffs in the tech sector and widespread anxiety about stability in the U.S. banking sector. 
 
So what happened? 
 
The pandemic was an era of massive growth for both technology companies and crypto. That surge began to wane in late 2021 as people began to travel, go out to restaurants or catch a show. They spent much less time in front of screens and at the same time, the government stimulus checks that allowed people some financial cushion began to run out. Crypto began to fall in tandem with technology. On top of that, in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began an aggressive string of rate hikes, its most powerful weapon to fight inflation, which had begun to rise rapidly. 
 
That put bitcoin prices in freefall. Higher interest rates mean that safe assets like Treasurys become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased, dulling the shine of high-growth companies and other assets that carry more risk. That includes bitcoin. 
 
Yet economic data earlier this year seemed to suggest that inflation had peaked, raising the chance that the Fed would ease off on rate hikes, and that was the start of bitcoin's bounce. 
 
How did the recent bank collapses play into all of this?
 
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank actually fueled investments in bitcoin. In the eyes of Wall Street, a shaky financial system lowered the odds even further that the Fed could continue raising rates, as had been the prevailing expectation as recently as the start of last week, before Silicon Valley Bank blew up. 
 
'As the economy heads towards a recession, the cryptoverse could look more attractive than equities,' wrote Edward Moya of Oanda in a research report. 'It appears the downside risks are greater for the S&P 500 than they are for Bitcoin.'
 
If an investor on Jan. 1 put $100 into bitcoin and $100 in an S&P 500 index fund, the bitcoin investment would have returned $60, compared with a $2 return on the S&P bet.
 
So will bitcoin keep rising?
 
All eyes now turn to the Federal Reserve, which meets next week and will make a decision on what to do about its benchmark interest rate. 
 
What the Fed does may not matter at all as far as bitcoin investors are concerned. 
 
'Bitcoin is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it comes to how it reacts to Fed rate expectations,' Moya said. 'For most of last year, higher Treasury yields alongside rising Fed rate hike expectations spelled trouble for Bitcoin. Fed rate cut bets are good news for cryptos, but a severe recession should prove troubling for all risky assets, including bitcoin.'

Emphasizing that government bailouts have begun following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, Kiyosaki warned that the Fed will inject more 'fake money' into the 'sick economy.'


Robert Kiyosaki's ‘Crash Landing' Warning


Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki warned about an incoming economic 'crash landing' Monday after two major banks were shut down by regulators in the U.S. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.


Kiyosaki tweeted:


Bail outs begin. More fake money to invade sick economy. Still recommend same response. Buy more gold, silver, bitcoin. Take care. Crash landing ahead.


On Sunday, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a joint statement stating that depositors of 
Silicon Valley Bank
 and 
Signature Bank
 will have access to all of their money, and no related losses will be borne by taxpayers. The Federal Reserve Board also announced that it will make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions.


Kiyosaki calls the U.S. dollar 'fake money' because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, instead of being tied to 'real money,' such as gold, he previously 
explained
.
 
The renowned author has long advised investing in gold, silver, and bitcoin, which he recently touted as the '
best for unstable times
.' In a recent warning, he predicted that '
everything will crash
.' In December of last year, he 
suggested
 that investing in gold, silver, and bitcoin would lead to riches when the Fed pivots and prints trillions of dollars.


Earlier this month, he cautioned that the world economy is 
on the verge of collapse
, warning of bank runs, frozen savings, and bail-ins. Prior to the shutdown of Signature Bank, he predicted that another bank was 
set to crash
. In January, he said we are in a 
global recession
, warning of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness.

122,Circle Issues Update Amid Stablecoin Volatility; Firm Is Prepared to 'Stand Behind USDC and Cover Any Shortfall' – Bitcoin News,Jamie Redman,2023-03-12 00:00:15,date,https://news.bitcoin.com/circle-issues-update-amid-stablecoin-volatility-firm-is-prepared-to-stand-behind-usdc-and-cover-any-shortfall/,bitcoin.com,Circle noted that the stablecoin's liquidity operations will resume normally on Monday morning in the United States.,"On Saturday, March 11, 2023, Circle Financial updated the public about its stablecoin, USDC, and noted that the stablecoin's liquidity operations will resume normally on Monday morning in the United States. Circle said that the company's teams would be ready on Monday to 'handle significant volume' and that the firm will 'stand behind USDC and cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.'


Circle Financial Confident in USDC Stability Despite SVB Failure


Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, usd coin (USDC), 
addressed the public
 on Saturday, noting that the firm will be ready on Monday to 'handle significant volume.' The company discussed the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and also emphasized the USDC's 'strong liquidity and reserve assets.' On Monday, the stablecoin issuer noted, 'USDC will remain redeemable 1-for-1 with the U.S. dollar.'


While usd coin (USDC) is a crypto asset that operates 24/7 on various blockchains, Circle emphasized that 'issuance and redemption is constrained by the working hours of the U.S. banking system.' Circle's stablecoin USDC 
dropped to a low
 of $0.877 per unit on Saturday, March 11, 2023, at 3:02 a.m. ET. Following the announcement from Circle, USDC managed to rise 10% higher, and at 4:15 p.m., the stablecoin was swapping for $0.971 per coin. In addition to USDC, five other stablecoin assets 
deviated
 from their $1 parity on Saturday.
 
Circle said that while $3.3 billion in USDC cash reserves are held at SVB, the company initiated transfers of the funds to other banks, and it remains 'confident in the FDIC's management of the SVB situation and stands ready to receive these funds.' The stablecoin issuer further noted that it has 'reason to believe that, under applicable FDIC policy, transfers initiated prior to a bank entering receivership would have otherwise been processed normally.' Circle continued:


In other words, the FDIC should allow transactions to settle in the ordinary course through the end of a bank's standard daily processing cycle until the FDIC takes control of the failed institution.
 
However, Circle does address a negative scenario where SVB may not become whole, and the company's return may take time. Circle stressed that if that were to happen, it would still stand behind the stablecoin it issues. 'In such a case, Circle, as required by law under stored-value money transmission regulation, will stand behind [USDC] and cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary,' the company's update concludes.

, 
March 22, 2023
 /PRNewswire/ -- Navier, the leading expert in mining digital currencies in 
North America
, announced today the launch of Reactor.xyz, a first-of-its-kind Web3 platform that marks a seismic shift in the digital asset industry.
Reactor.xyz enables qualified individuals, companies, and institutions to simply and easily purchase access to enterprise-grade 
bitcoin
 mining operations through a novel approach that uses ERC-721 tokens on the 
Ethereum
 blockchain to represent ownership of the hashpower. These tokens can then be assigned to a mining pool of the user's choice and mining begins within minutes. Currently, access can be purchased for 120 terahashes across 120 days.
""We have been working on Reactor.xyz for a long time and are excited to finally bring it to market,"" said Navier CEO 
Josh Metnick
. ""
Bitcoin
 mining has long been far too difficult for most to access, or understand, this is no longer the case.""
Bitcoin
 mining being on 
Ethereum
 makes it a tradable asset that can be held in any Web3 wallet, bringing liquidity to a notoriously illiquid market sector. In essence, Navier has created an entirely new asset with the launch of Reactor.xyz.
Game changer
To this point, would-be 
Bitcoin
 miners had to first identify which machine they wanted, then wire money to far flung destinations that most people could not likely find on a map, and then wait months for their rigs to arrive. They then had to either sign co-location agreements with mining farms to host their equipment, and then constantly check to ensure their machines were always online, or they had to do the complicated math to figure out their mining breakeven point at local electricity rates.
Reactor.xyz's elegant solution enables more than just buying, selling, and trading of 
Bitcoin
 mining hashpower, it also uses proprietary algorithms to ensure users are made whole from any potential losses suffered during downtime or planned curtailments - 
bitcoin
 that would have been mined while your mining pool was offline is automatically added into your account.

Bitcoin
 mining hashpower on the

The government recently protected all deposits of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank after they failed.


U.S. Government Ready to Guarantee More Deposits if Needed


U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a speech to the American Bankers Association Tuesday that the government is ready to provide additional deposit guarantees if the banking crisis worsens.


Following the failures of several major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the government stepped in and guaranteed all deposits of the two failed banks beyond the usual $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage limit. The former Federal Reserve chair explained:


The steps we took were not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks. Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system. And similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion.


'The situation is stabilizing. And the U.S. banking system remains sound,' Yellen insisted.


Nonetheless, Treasury Department staff are reportedly exploring ways to temporarily expand FDIC insurance coverage to all deposits, Bloomberg reported Monday.
 
Last week, the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America asked federal regulators to extend FDIC insurance to 
all deposits
 for the next two years. 'It is imperative we restore confidence among depositors before another bank fails, avoiding panic and a further crisis,' the group said. In addition, U.S. Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer has urged the government to temporarily 
insure every bank deposit
 in the country to prevent runs on smaller banks.


However, Yellen dismissed last week the idea of the government providing guarantees for all deposits in the event of future bank failures.

Maybe Bitcoin isn't really internet money.
 Maybe it's a weapon for waging a new form of 21st-century cyber warfare.
That's what one major in the Space Force is arguing in a new MIT masters degree thesis that is causing a minor stir online in the wake of its publication last month. The 400-page tome snagged the top spot on Amazon's list of best-selling technology books earlier this month and currently sits at #3.
There's no sign the Pentagon is acting on the idea, but the thesis offers the latest hint that as a new generation enters important American institutions, its members see crypto networks as useful tools instead of gimmicks.
And if Jason Lowery's 'Softwar' is any indication, their thinking is getting more creative. The last time DFD brought you a Bitcoin proposal from Cambridge, Mass., was in November when a PhD student in Harvard's economics department published a paper recommending that 
central banks stock up
 on the digital asset. While you might call that proposal avant-garde, it at least fits established ways of thinking about Bitcoin.
By comparison, Lowery's thesis is positively galaxy-brained.
'Softwar' argues that the proof-of-work guessing game that underpins Bitcoin offers a less messy avenue for future power competition than nuclear war or 
swarms of killer robots
.
The metaphor Lowery employs, and uses for a cover image, is that of antlers. They may look silly, but they allow two stags to fight each other over territory without inflicting fatal damage.
In the case of proof-of-work cyber-antlers, the victor in each round wins some network tokens and the right to publish the next block of transactions. Because proof-of-work depends on the ability to harness energy to generate computer guesses, power in the network would be widely distributed throughout physical space to disparate energy sources that are difficult to centrally control.
In some ways, the role Lowery envisions for proof-of-work contests is similar to the one played by chess matches and the Olympics during the Cold War: a form of competition that falls short of a shooting war. Instead of gaining national prestige, the winner of proof-of-work competitions gains power within a distributed computer network that is being used to assign abstract property rights.
The stakes of this contest would be higher if countries followed a related proposal from the thesis: to use Bitcoin as a cyber-security tool.
That idea hearkens back to the pre-Bitcoin development of proof-of-work, when, in 1997, computer scientist Adam Back proposed 'hashcash.' The idea was to thwart spammers by requiring email senders to solve a guessing problem that required a moderate amount of computer power — like an easier form of Bitcoin mining — to make it prohibitively costly to blast thousands of people with junk mail.
Following Back, Lowery suggests that software systems can thwart certain kinds of attacks, like denial of service attacks — which overwhelm servers by flooding them with incoming requests — with Bitcoin. The idea is to design programs that only respond to external signals that are accompanied by sufficiently large transactions recorded on the Bitcoin network.
If the network doubled as a cyber-security system, that would be all the more reason to compete for a share of control and to prevent adversaries from gaining special influence over it.
Lowery, who does not lack for imaginative metaphors, also suggests that the Bitcoin network amounts to a cyber-equivalent to maritime trade routes — in other words, as a vector for economic exchange — and that there is a military imperative to protect freedom of navigation on the network.
The thesis calls for the U.S. to stockpile Bitcoin, cultivate a domestic Bitcoin mining industry, and extend 2nd Amendment protections to the technology on the theory that it's a weapon of self-defense.
The proposal is certainly creative, but is it plausible?
Military thinkers entertain all sorts of out-there ideas. Some, like splitting the nucleus of an atom, pan out. Others 
don't
.
An Air Force spokesperson confirmed only Lowery's rank, that he was a U.S. Air Force fellow at MIT, and that he is stationed at Patrick Space Force Base in Florida. Joan Rubin, executive director of MIT's System Design and Management program, confirmed the thesis was submitted as part of Lowery's graduate studies.
Lowery himself did not respond to several interview requests.
Beyond the imaginative and technical hurdles to this vision, there are political ones. Even if the Pentagon embraces Lowery's view of the military value of Bitcoin, the U.S. faces countervailing national imperatives to curb carbon emissions and maintain the ability to impose sanctions through the dollar banking systems.
On Twitter, Lowery has been outspoken, but vague, about impending government threats to Bitcoin.
'Soon, powerful people within the US government will try to assert that supporting 
#Bitcoin
 is a threat to US National Security,' he said in one recent tweet, that appears to have been deleted.
'I don't know how else I can be more explicitly clear with the public without getting in trouble,' he began 
a tweet
 on Tuesday that offered a similar warning.
So, it seems that anyone who wants the U.S. government to grow a pair of cyber-antlers will first need to master other forms of non-lethal resource competition: argumentation and bureaucratic jockeying.

Don't throw a ‘law book' at the metaverse, Clegg says: 
Meta's no. 2 Nick Clegg called for European regulators to tread lightly when setting rules of the road for the metaverse. During an interview with Rebecca Kern and other journalists on the metaverse Wednesday via Meta's Horizon Workroom, the former U.K. deputy prime minister discussed his views on the 
European Commission's 'virtual worlds'
 initiative that's setting guidelines for the new technology.
'As an ex-regulator legislator myself, I would caution against regulators seeking to regulate something which hasn't yet taken shape because you end up regulating the wrong thing,' said Clegg's avatar — which bore a striking resemblance, down to his thick-rimmed glasses and navy blue suit jacket with pocket square.
'You do need to go through quite a profound phase of understanding first, rather than immediately throwing a heavy kind of law book at something which hasn't yet been fully invented,' Clegg added, who as Meta's president of global affairs oversees the company's policy and regulatory decisions.
He said some of the biggest players building the hardware and operating systems for the metaverse are from the U.S. and China — and notably not from Europe. 'So it'd be a shame if Europe were to rush to legislate something which is actually being invented elsewhere, and it hasn't remotely yet taken full form.' —

The seemingly world-breaking potential of generative AI 
has some major voices calling for a pause.
Following the high-profile 
open letter published this week
 that featured more than 1,000 signatories asking for a six-month pause on AI development, the research nonprofit Center for AI and Digital Policy has 
filed a consumer complaint
 with the Federal Trade Commission asking them to investigate OpenAI, as POLITICO's Mohar Chatterjee reported in today's Morning Tech newsletter for Pro subscribers.
The calls for more caution, and even explicit regulatory guardrails, around AI are growing fast. As Mohar also points out, CAIDP's chair Merve Hickok appeared before a House committee this month and 
pleaded for more regulatory action
.
And 
Dario Gil
, senior VP and director of IBM Research, told Morning Tech that 'Uncontrolled, broad experiments, especially on the public, are the wrong way to advance any category of innovation and particularly one as powerful as artificial intelligence… For AI, that means careful implementations focused on specific use cases with proper controls and governance in place, and ethical considerations addressed from the outset. All of us stand to benefit more from AI done responsibly than from reckless experimentation.' —

Becoming available on a private beta starting today, USDB, a...","HONG KONG, March 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stabolut, a startup that is building a completely new worldwide payments ecosystem and the issuer of the USDB, today announced that it has just launched a fully decentralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin called USDB. Available as of today, March 29th, 2023, USDB is a stablecoin issued under a groundbreaking model that's built on decentralized pillars of trustless infrastructure and security that have made Bitcoin the world's most trusted and reliable cryptocurrency.
 
 
USDB enters a very hot market, as stablecoins total 140 billion in capitalization, which is currently expected to grow to at least 1 trillion. Simultaneously, opinion leaders in crypto have been asking for a truly decentralized and privacy preserving stablecoin that everyone in the industry can trust, set up with verified and audited assets and invulnerable to shut downs. 
 
'Stabolut is setting the new industry leading standards for moving financial value across the internet and crypto markets with USDB,' said Eneko Knorr, co-founder and CEO of Stabolut. 'There's clear market demand from users for a reliable stablecoin choice, given the collapse of UST -Terra Luna's stablecoin-, as well as witnessing the recent instability caused by the de-pegging of USDC following the recent bank failures we've seen this year. With USDB, Stabolut is helping to unlock a new era of transparent privacy-preserving, fast, inexpensive, secure and interoperable exchange across the globe.' said Julian Beltran, co-founder and CTO of Stabolut. 
 
For a truly decentralized economy, a decentralized currency is essential. In May 2022, Stabolut embarked on the development of USDB, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed to reflect the value of the US Dollar through an innovative method: shorting Bitcoin via a Bitcoin inverse perpetual swap. Asset-backed USDB eliminates the need for bank accounts, ensuring immunity from crackdowns or frozen funds, and bolstering complete privacy and resilience. Fiat-backed stablecoins face centralization and regulatory hurdles, limiting access and innovation while increasing counterparty risk and reducing user privacy. USDB's approach aligns with Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes' Nakadollar (NUSD) concept. 
 
'Our solution addresses the limitations of fiat-backed stablecoins, which suffer from centralization and regulatory challenges. By mitigating counterparty risks and enhancing user privacy, we aim to expand accessibility and foster innovation in the stablecoin market.' said Eneko Knorr. 
 
USDB will power cross chain transactions and inter-chain exports across all the ecosystems and beyond, providing users and exchanges with a global stablecoin where they can take their power back from the western financial system and interact with their money on their own terms no matter where or who they are. USDB will work broadly with Bitcoin compatible wallets, protocols, and other blockchain services.

Game Variety: 5/5
This casino offers players a grand total of 4,200+ crypto slots, table games, and unique specialty titles. You can also play 150+ live dealer variants of blackjack, baccarat, roulette, Super 6, and poker (not available in some countries).
Even though some players won't have access to live casino games, there's plenty to do in between spins.
Our experts found 100+ virtual table games, a dice jackpot game, and other unique specialties that range from Crash to Limbo.

Notably, high rollers can score up to 4 BTC in reload bonuses with their next 3 Bitcoin deposits.
In total, you can 
get up to 5 BTC in welcome deposit promos and 180 free spins

Crypto Compatibility: 4.9/5
You can use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, or DOGE to initiate deposits and withdrawals at Bitstarz.
Although you can deposit just 0.0002 BTC to start playing games with the site, you'd need to fund your account with 0.0008 BTC or more to claim their welcome bonus.
If you decide to spring for their reload bonuses, you'll have to deposit at least 0.002 BTC to qualify.

Ignition
 – Best Crypto Casino for Poker
Pros
24/7 online poker room
250+ crypto casino games
Get bonuses up to $3,000
Accepts 5 forms of crypto
Chat, email + Forum support
Cons
No phone support available
Ignition hosts a solid collection of 250+ crypto casino games, but most players stick around for their online poker experience. You can play BTC poker tournaments - and the sharks don't bite here because their poker room is very beginner-friendly.
Game Variety: 4.8/5
Ignition's 24/7 online poker room is accessible to every player. New sign-ups will compete against thousands of real people for real money. You can bet the small blind for just $5, but high rollers won't want to miss out on their collection of high-limit rooms.
No matter your budget, you're guaranteed to have a blast! In addition, Ignition's tables are 5-10% softer than other crypto poker sites.
Finally, their 'Monthly Milly' tournament is always ongoing – work your way up their leaderboards for a chance to win $1 million every month.
Welcome Bonus: 4.4/5
Ignition's double-ended welcome package offers 
up to $3,000 to new players
. Just use the promo code 'IGWPCB150″ with your first and second BTC transactions of $20 or more to qualify.
They'll match your first transaction by 150% up to $1,500, so you can explore 250+ casino games with fair 25x wagering requirements standing between you and your next win.
Poker players might be disappointed to learn that Ignition's reload bonus isn't given upfront. Instead, you'll have 30 days to 'unlock' your 150% poker bonus up to $1,500. As you play cash games in their 24/7 poker room, you'll get BTC back in rake.
Crypto Compatibility: 4.8/5
In addition to debit and credit card deposits, Ignition accepts 5 forms of crypto. You can use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, ETH, and USDT to initiate deposits and withdrawals here.
New players must deposit at least $20 in crypto or $25 in cash to start playing crypto poker and claim bonuses with the site.
However, you can withdraw as little as $10 or as much as $9,500 per BTC transaction. As you might expect, all crypto withdrawals are free of charge at Ignition.
Still, they're not quite instant – you'll wait up to 24 hours before receiving your BTC winnings.
Customer Support: 5/5
Ignition keeps its players satisfied with 24/7 chat, email, and forum-based support.
Our experts would suggest using Ignition's live chat feature if you require immediate assistance, but we have no complaints about their 6-hour email response times.
Finally, if you have any lingering questions or concerns, feel free to check out Ignition's Player Forum. This free community offers boatloads of helpful information from A-Z, and it's easy to post your own inquiries.

Contrary to their name, Super Slots offers more than just crypto reels - but it's certainly what they do best.
That said, we found 20+ live dealer tables here, and their jackpot blackjack prizes linger in six-figure territory.
Game Variety: 4.5/5
As you might expect, Super Slots hosts 350+ crypto reels and counting. From classic games to high-limit progressives, they have it all!
What you might not expect to find is their collection of 20+ live dealer tables. You can play blackjack, baccarat and roulette with a real dealer and enjoy flexible betting limits.
Opt into their $1 side bet whenever you play live blackjack – if you get three seven of diamonds in your hand, you'll take home a six-figure grand prize.
Welcome Bonus: 4.6/5
Use the promo code 'CRYPTO400″ with your first-ever deposit at Super Slots.
They'll 
match your initial transaction by 400% up to $4,000
, essentially quadrupling your bankroll to get started! Even if you deposit the minimum of $20, you won't start playing casino games with less than $80 in your betting account.
Crypto Compatibility:5/5
Beyond just Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Super Slots accepts a staggering 18 forms of cryptocurrency. From ADA and Binance Coin to ETH and USDT, they're up-to-date with all the latest altcoins. Notably, you can deposit or withdraw between $20 and $100,000 per transaction!
Their $20 deposit minimum also unlocks that 400% bonus up to $4,000 we mentioned earlier.
Of course, all crypto payouts are free of charge, but you may have to wait up to 48 hours before seeing your winnings delivered. In most cases, though, payouts reach your wallet on the same day.
Customer Support: 4.7/5
Super Slots offers 24/7 chat and email support, but they're not active on social media and we didn't find a phone number for players to call.
As such, we'd recommend using their 24/7 chat feature if you need to reach out – our experts got a reply from a real person within seconds.
On the bright side, their dedicated 'Help Center' is filled with useful information. Read through gameplay rules, learn about deposits and withdrawals, and more!

Average sports betting odds
MyStake challenges the assumption that you can have too much of a good thing. They host 6,000+ casino games, 30+ sports betting categories, and 17+ ongoing promotions.
Game Variety: 4.7/5
MyStake is a great choice for casino traditionalists and sports bettors alike.
We found 6,000+ casino games in total, but some of them may be restricted depending on your country of residence. With so many options at your fingertips, we highly doubt that you'll notice the difference.
Even still, their online sportsbook is fully available to every player. You'll explore hundreds of betting markets across 30+ popular categories.
If you want our advice, we'd recommend waiting for MyStake's 'Boosted' Odds.
Welcome Bonus: 5/5
It can be hard to choose from MyStake's 
endless library of bonuses and promotions
, but we've got you covered.
Casino gamers should check out their 170% initial match up to $1,000, while sports bettors might prefer their 100% first deposit match up to $500.

Additionally, every time you deposit with crypto, you'll qualify for 10% cashback. MyStake's ongoing social media giveaway is the cherry on top of this ice cream sundae.
Crypto Compatibility: 4.8/5
In addition to multiple fiat currencies, MyStake accepts 10 forms of crypto.
You can use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LTC, XRP, USDT, ETH, and more to initiate deposits and withdrawals here. As it stands, you must deposit $20 or more to 'unlock' their library of bonuses and promotions.
Should you get lucky enough to win, you can request as little as $20 per transaction. New players are limited to cashing out $7,500 per week and $15,000 per month. It goes without saying that all crypto transactions are free, and most payouts are delivered within minutes!
Customer Support: 4.8/5
Like many BTC casinos, MyStake offers 24/7 chat and email support for every new player. Our team enjoyed immediate and helpful feedback from real people across the board. However, we'd like to see them implement a phone number for 'old-school' players to call.
In the meantime, we'd recommend joining MyStake's Discord server for the latest updates!
You'll be connected with thousands of players and support agents in real time.

Bovada is among the only BTC casinos with a dedicated 24/7 phone line, so we have to give them credit where it's due! If you require immediate assistance, you can also use their 24/7 live chat feature to get in touch. Finally, their 24/7 email hotline is best used for complex inquiries.

'That's the old playbook when central banks would rush to rescue the economy as recession hit. Now they're causing the recession to fight sticky inflation – and that makes rate cuts unlikely, in our view,' said the firm's strategists.


Blackrock's Interest Rate Prediction


Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, published weekly commentary Monday explaining the state of the U.S. economy and why it does not see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year.


While noting that 'Markets have been quick to price in rate cuts as a result of the banking sector turmoil and the Fed signaling a coming pause,' Blackrock's strategists wrote:


We don't see rate cuts this year – that's the old playbook when central banks would rush to rescue the economy as recession hit. Now they're causing the recession to fight sticky inflation – and that makes rate cuts unlikely, in our view.


'Stocks have held up due to hopes for rate cuts that we don't see coming. We think the Fed could only deliver the rate cuts priced in by markets if a more serious credit crunch took hold and caused an even deeper recession than we expect,' the strategists explained.


'Inflation is likely to prove even stickier than the Fed expects without a deep recession, in our view. The February U.S. CPI data confirmed our view that inflation is still not on track to settle at the Fed's target,' they added.
 
The Blackrock strategists continued: 'Recession is foretold as central banks try to bring inflation back down to policy targets. It's the opposite of past recessions: Rate cuts are not on the way to help support risk assets, in our view.' They noted:


In the U.S., it's now evident in the financial cracks emerging from higher interest rates on top of rate-sensitive sectors. Higher mortgage rates have hurt sales of new homes. We also see other warning signs, such as deteriorating CEO confidence, delayed capital spending plans and consumers depleting savings.


Do you think the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year? Let us know in the comments section below.

 /PRNewswire/ --
 LM Funding America, Inc. (NASDAQ: LMFA) (""LM Funding"" or the ""Company""),
 a 
cryptocurrency
 mining and technology-based specialty finance company, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the year ended 
December 31
, 2022.
(PRNewswire)
Operational Highlights
Approximately 2,800 
Bitcoin
 mining machines in operation as of 
December 31, 2022
.
Placed approximately 700 machines in operation in the first quarter 2023.
Anticipate an additional approximately 2,300 machines installed by 
June 30, 2023
, to bring total installed capacity to approximately 600 PH/s.
Bruce Rodgers
, Chairman and CEO of LM Funding, commented, ""In 2021, we made the strategic decision to transform LM Funding into a 
Bitcoin
 mining company, and subsequently took measures to reposition the Company. Late in 2021, we placed an order for approximately 5,000 
Bitcoin
 mining machines. As we progressed through 2022, we experienced a period of transition, locating and electrifying some of our mining machines, and initiating our 
Bitcoin
 mining operations. We also opportunistically capitalized on lower hardware pricing to order an additional 665 machines in the second half of 2022, bringing the total number of assets on hand to approximately 5,660 
Bitcoin
 mining machines at year-end 2022. The Company subsequently purchased additional XP mining machines in early January 2023.  When all 5,850 machines are fully operational, the Company anticipates total mining capacity of approximately 600 PH/s. We believe the decision to transform the Company into a 
Bitcoin
 mining company was the right one and that the results we demonstrated in the fourth quarter will accelerate as we continue to acquire, locate, electrify, and commence mining of 
Bitcoin
 on additional machines.""
Richard Russell
, Chief Financial Officer of LM Funding commented, ""In addition to our revenue growth, our balance sheet remains solid. As of 
December 31, 2022
, we had 
$4.2 million
 in cash, approximately 55 Bitcoins valued at 
$0.8 million
, working capital of 
$8.3 million
, and LMFA stockholders' equity of 
$49.2 million
, or 
$3.76
 per share.  As a result, we believe we are well capitalized to execute on our growth strategy, which we believe will drive significant value for our shareholders in the years to come.""
Financial Highlights
Total revenue for the twelve months ended 
December 31, 2022
, was approximately 
$1.7 million
, an increase of 
$0.8 million
, or 93% from 
$0.9 million
 for the full-year 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in 
Bitcoin
 mining revenue of 
$0.9 million
 that was predominately generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 in connection with the commencement of our 
Bitcoin
 mining operations in late 2022.
Cash of approximately 
$4.2 million
, digital assets of 
$0.9 million
, and working capital of 
$8.3 million
 as of 
December 31, 2022
.
Total LMFA stockholders' equity of 
$49.2 million
 and net equity per share of 
$3.76
 as of 
December 31, 2022
. (Calculated as LMFA stockholders' equity divided by 13,091,883 shares outstanding as of 
December 31, 2022
)

We present an analysis on variability Bitcoin characteristics that help to quantitatively differentiate Bitcoin from the state-owned traditional currencies and the asset Gold. We provide a detailed study on returns of exchange rates—against the Swiss Franc—of several traditional currencies together with Bitcoin and Gold; for that purpose, we define a distance between currencies by means of the spectral densities of the ARMA models of the returns of the exchange rates, and we present the computed matrix of the distances between the chosen currencies. A statistical analysis of these matrix distances is further proposed, which shows that the distance between Bitcoin and any other currency or Gold is not comparable to any of the distances between currencies or between currencies and Gold and not involving Bitcoin. This result shows that Bitcoin is essentially different from the traditional currencies and from Gold, at least in what concerns the structure of its variance and auto-covariances.

Our investigation strives to unearth the best portfolio hedging strategy for the G7 stock indices through Bitcoin and gold using daily data relevant to the period 2 January 2016 to 5 January 2023. This study uses the DVECH-GARCH model to model dynamic correlation and then compute optimal hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness. The empirical findings show that Bitcoin and gold were rather effective hedge assets before COVID-19 and diversifiers during the pandemic and Russia–Ukraine war. From hedging effectiveness perspectives, gold and Bitcoin are safe-haven assets, and the investment risk of G7 stock indices could be hedged by taking a short position during thepandemic period and war except for the pair Nikkei/Gold. Additionally, gold beats Bitcoin in terms of hedging efficiency. We thus demonstrate the central role of Bitcoin and gold as financial market participants, particularly during market turmoil and downward movements. Our findings can be of interest to investors, regulators, and governments to take into consideration the role of Bitcoin in financial markets.


 










 


The Russia–Ukraine war is an ongoing confrontation between Russia and Ukraine that started in February 2014, following the Ukrainian Dignity Revolution, and was initially centered on the status of Crimea and sections of the Donbas, both of which are recognized internationally as being part of Ukraine. Following a Russian military deployment on the Russia–Ukraine border beginning in late 2021, the war escalated substantially on 24 February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine signaling the start of the armed confrontation between the two countries.
Responding to Russia's attack on Ukraine, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western nations attacked Russia's economy in several ways. Among the worst sanctions were those imposed by the United States and the European Union on Russia's central bank by freezing its assets in order to prevent Russia from utilizing its substantial foreign reserves to help support its currency, the ruble, and to impair Russia's capacity to pay for the Ukraine conflict. These sanctions are broad. Other nations, alongside Europe, have stepped in, including South Korea and Japan, and the sanctions have been enforced even by neutral nations such as Switzerland. The consequences do not have a severe impact on Russia's economy but they threaten the global economy, causing financial markets to tremble and making life more hazardous for everyone (
Wiseman 2022
).
While the whole world still tries to recover from the current COVID-19 health crisis, the Russia–Ukraine war emerged, causing turmoil in global financial markets. This will probably question the safe haven property of certain assets. Several analyses on the consequences of previous Ukraine–Russia wars prior to the most current crisis in 2022 have been released. For instance, 
Korovkin and Makarin
 (
2019
) investigated the economic consequences of the 2014 Russia–Ukraine war, noting that commercial interchange continued between the two countries despite the start of the conflict. Given that the 2022 Russia–Ukraine conflict is an ongoing issue with continually updated material streaming via various news channels, very little academic study compilation has been produced. In this respect, our study adds to the literature by assessing the hedging and safe haven properties of gold and Bitcoin for G7 investors during the 2022 Ukraine crisis. Our results indicate that both gold and Bitcoin could serve as hedge assets during stable periods. We thus join

 (

), for MSCI indices of the world, Europe and Pacific, S&P 500, FTSE 100, DAX 30, Nikkei 225, and Shanghai A-share. We prove the safe-haven property of Bitcoin for investors in G7 stock indices, expanding on the findings of (

. Additionally, gold is an effective safe haven during crisis, as proved by (

). In terms of hedging strategies, gold beats Bitcoin during crisis, whereas the hedging efficiency of Bitcoin was better during COVID-19 compared to the war period.
This study tries to provide contributions to the literature on cross-market co-movements in many aspects. First, we study the association structure among gold, Bitcoin, and developed stock markets. Such analysis enables the determination of new time-varying patterns which might govern the connectedness among commodity, cryptocurrency, and stock markets. Second, our analysis of the cross-broader asset holdings could provide interesting information for setting up stock-pricing models. Second, it helps us to better understand the intra- and inter-country (dis)similarities in terms of information spillovers. Third, this analysis investigates how cross-market linkages react to unprecedented events such as the Russia–Ukraine war. The remainder of our paper provides a literature review in 
Section 2
, methodology in 
Section 3
, data and different empirical results in 
Section 4
, and finally, 
Section 5
 concludes. 
Recently, the world witnessed two major black swan events, namely the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Russia–Ukraine war. The COVID-19 health crisis was first reported in Wuhan, China, and quickly escalated into a global sanitary problem driving the WHO to announce this health issue as a new global health crisis on 11 March 2020. The Russian–Ukrainian battle began on 24 February 2022 and has resulted in a vast number of deaths as well as Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Both disasters maintained serious financial ramifications for the stock markets and the global economy.
Academic background in assessing the significant financial consequences of the unprecedented COVID-19 health crisis has been widely investigated (
Albulescu 2021
; 
Baig et al. 2020
; 
Conlon and McGee 2020
; 
Corbet et al. 2020
; 
Jeribi et al. 2020
; 
Jeribi and Snene-Manzli 2021
; 
Mazur et al. 2021
; 
Zaremba et al. 2020
; 
Zhang et al. 2020
). However, research on the impact of Russian military actions on financial markets is quite scarce. Obviously, this crisis will result in higher inflation, lower household consumption due to higher prices (oil, gas, wheat, and minerals), supply chain interruptions, volatility, economic growth obstacles, investment reductions, and stock swings globally and in Europe in particular, given that both countries are substantial exporters to Europe. In this case, portfolio diversification through hedges and safe havens is becoming increasingly important.
According to 
Baur and Lucey
 (
2010
) and 
Baur and McDermott
 (
2010
, 
2016
), a safe-haven asset is a commodity in which an investor seeks refuge during periods of market collapse. It is non-correlated or negatively correlated with another asset or portfolio during times of turbulence. Because of its numerous characteristics, gold is considered a multi-dimensional asset. These characteristics include money, commodity, and risk avoidance (
Wu et al. 2019
). Gold is a hedging commodity in portfolio diversification and a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty and market volatility; therefore, studies have concentrated more on the risk avoidance feature. More significantly, gold has been shown to hold its value throughout market upheavals (
Ji et al. 2020
; 
Salisu et al. 2020
; 
Salisu and Adediran 2020
; 
Shahzad et al. 2020
).
A substantial amount of studies have been conducted to determine if gold can be used as a safe haven (
Bouri et al. 2020c
; 
Shahzad et al. 2020
), but the findings have been mixed. For instance, 
Baur and Lucey
 (
2010
) found that gold, on average, is a hedge against equities and a safe haven in times of excessive stock market volatility. 
Hood and Malik
 (
2013
) agreed that gold might be used as a hedge against the stock market in the United States. 
Gürgün and Ünalmış
 (
2014
) investigated gold's safe haven and hedging features for stock prices from the viewpoints of both local and international investors, and they concluded that gold could be a hedge and a safe haven in the majority of the nations surveyed. More importantly, they discovered that the yellow metal is a safe haven in more nations as stock prices severely deteriorate.
Salisu et al.
 (
2021a
) confirmed the safe haven property of gold during the COVID-19 pandemic with greater effectiveness before the pandemic. 
Tanin et al.
 (
2022
) argued that investors are more attracted to gold due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 
Salisu et al.
 (
2021b
) investigated gold's role as a safe haven or hedging tool against crude oil price uncertainties during the early COVID-19 pandemic, concluding that gold has a substantial safe-haven characteristic against oil price risks. More recently, 
Ghorbel et al.
 (
2022
) discovered a negative asymmetric association between the yellow metal and the different stock prices using the NARDL model for the COVID-19 timeframe, implying that gold can function as a suitable hedging tool or a safe-haven against stock prices in the short and long term.
However, research suggests that gold's potential to act as a hedge or safe haven against the stock market varies regarding the markets (
Beckmann and Czudaj 2015
; 
Gürgün and Ünalmış 2014
) and the different market conditions. 
Bredin et al.
 (
2015
) demonstrated that gold works as a safe haven for US stock market prices during financial crises but not throughout the 1980s economic recessions. When studying the role of gold as a hedge and safe haven from the viewpoint of Chinese investors, 
Ming et al.
 (
2020
) discovered that gold is not a hedge against the Chinese stock market on average. On the other hand, they stated that gold operates as a safe haven when market returns are below their 1%, 5%, and 10% quantiles, as well as during the two crisis periods.
Baur and McDermott
 (
2010
) produced worldwide evidence that gold may operate as a hedge and a safe haven asset in major European stock markets and the United States but not in Australia, Canada, Japan, or significant developing markets such as those of the BRIC nations. Likewise, 
Iqbal
 (
2017
) demonstrated that gold does not serve as a hedge against the Pakistani and Indian stock markets. Similarly, 
Smiech and Papiez
 (
2016
) demonstrated that gold is a weak hedge against the US stock market by generalizing the 
Baur and Lucey
 (
2010
) model. According to 
Shahzad et al.
 (
2019
), gold is a poor safe refuge, but this behavior varies over time, and gold cannot protect investors' valuables during the COVID-19 spread (
Cheema et al. 2020
). In addition, when researching the influence of the coronavirus on the Tunisian stock market, 
Jeribi and Snene-Manzli
 (
2021
) discovered that the yellow metal did not perform as a hedge or a safe haven for Tunisian investors during the outbreak.
On the other hand, cryptocurrency is another well-known safe-haven asset choice. As many analysts questioned gold's safe-haven capacity during the Global Financial Crisis period (
Baur and Glover 2012
; 
Bekiros et al. 2017
; 
Klein 2017
), Bitcoin was launched around that time as a remedy to the fragile global financial system. Despite its significant price volatility, the tradability of Bitcoin units on specific trading platforms has rendered it an investment asset (
Polasik et al. 2015
).
Interestingly, Bitcoin provides a safe haven against sovereign risk and the instability of the global financial system (
Bouri et al. 2017b
). Since Bitcoin is immune to economic and financial factors (
Corbet et al. 2018
), it is considered a significant diversifier (
Bouri et al. 2017a
, 
2017b
; 
Brière et al. 2015
; 
Dyhrberg 2016b
), particularly during financial market downturns (
Bouri et al. 2017b
). 
Ji et al.
 (
2018
) investigated the network structure that exists between Bitcoin and a variety of asset classes (including equities indices). They demonstrated that Bitcoin has a relatively weak association with equities, but the link is not consistent over time and is influenced by structural fractures.

 This paper contributes to the literature dedicated to the interlinkages between cryptocurrencies and currencies by investigating whether Bitcoin price movements affect the exchange rates of a sample of nine European countries with non-euro currencies. By resorting to the novel unconditional quantile regression, we show that there is a statistically significant link between Bitcoin price movements and changes in nominal exchange rates. In normal market conditions, an increase in the price of Bitcoin can be associated with an appreciation of the currencies from our sample, while during the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship inversed. In addition, we find heterogeneities in this relationship, depending on the level of change in the nominal exchange rate. The results emphasize the relevance of Bitcoin price movements to the conduct of monetary policy through the exchange rate channel and that investors in cryptocurrencies and various financial assets denominated in the currencies from our sample can benefit from diversification by including both types of assets in their portfolios.

143,Is It Illegal To Purchase Or Trade Bitcoin?,Minh,2023-04-14 00:00:00,date,https://www.mondaq.com/fin-tech/1304200/is-it-illegal-to-purchase-or-trade-bitcoin,mondaq.com,"Currently, in the current legal documents of Vietnamese law, there is no specific regulation on what Bitcoin is.","Currently, in the current legal documents of Vietnamese law, there is no specific regulation on what Bitcoin is.
 
In reality, Bitcoin is a type of virtual currency. Virtual currency refers to a digital currency that is not regulated and is typically created and controlled by developers. It is used as a form of payment among members of a virtual community who accept it.
 
This is a currency that can only be used in a certain community or organization. The legal value of the virtual currency (Bitcoin) is not recognized under current Vietnamese legislation.
 
Blockchain technology is the foundation of Bitcoin. Blockchain will offer a record of all network transactions but will keep the identity of those who make the transactions private.
 
A number of articles of Decree No. 101/2012/ND-CP have been amended and supplemented in accordance with the terms of Clause 1, Article 1 of Decree 80/2016/ND-CP, the following non-cash payment methods are permitted under Vietnamese legislation in payment transactions: Cheques, payment orders, collection orders, bank cards, and other payment instruments as prescribed by the State Bank.
 
Thereby, based on the aforementioned regulation, Bitcoin does not belong in the non-cash payment methods approved. As a result, it is illegal to use virtual currency, such as bitcoin, to conduct financial transactions in Vietnam.
 
However, there are no specific legal provisions in the Vietnamese legal system that address Bitcoin trading activity. According to Decision No. 27/2018/QD-TTg, the bitcoin industry is neither currently included in Vietnam's system of economic sectors, nor is it included among the business areas in which foreign investment is restricted under the Investment Law 2020.
 
As a result, it is understandable that Vietnamese legislation does not explicitly allow the trading of bitcoin, but there is also no specific regulation prohibiting these activities.
 
The consequences of using Bitcoin for transactions
 
According to Decree 88/2019/ND-CP at point d, Clause 6, Article 26, as amended and supplemented by Decree 143/2021/ND-CP, using Bitcoin to conduct financial transactions would result in the following penalties:
 
 
Acts of issuing, supplying, and using illegal means of payment that are not yet subject to criminal prosecution will be subject to a fine of between VND 50 million and VND 100 million.
 
In addition, any individual or organization that opens a payment account for a customer, or allows a customer to use a payment account in contravention of the law in the process of providing payment services will also be fined from 50 million VND to 100 million VND.
 
 
If there are clear signs that someone is using Bitcoin for payment in transactions, they could be prosecuted for criminal liability in accordance with Article 206 of the 2015 Criminal Code No. 100/2015/QH13, as amended and supplemented in Clause 48, Article 1 of the Law amending the Criminal Code 2017, specifically as follows:
 
A fine of between VND 50 million and VND 300 million or imprisonment from 06 months to 03 years:
 
This case applies when someone commits an act that causes property damage to others from VND 100 million to under VND 300 million, acts including:
 
 
In case of not being granted credit but granting credit (except for the case of granting in the form of credit card issuance).
 
Granting unsecured credit or granting credit with preferential conditions to subjects who are restricted from granting credit as prescribed by law.
 
Violating regulations on safety ratios for operations of credit institutions, and foreign bank branches as prescribed by the Law on Credit Institutions.
 
For the purpose of granting credit to the case where a security asset is required and the act intentionally inflates the value of the security asset.
 
For subjects restricted from credit extension, they commit acts of violating the law on total outstanding loans.
 
Granting credit beyond the limit compared to owning capital to a customer and related person (except for cases with the approval of a competent person as prescribed by law).
 
Violation of the law on capital contribution, capital contribution limit, share purchase, and credit granting conditions.
 
Illegally issuing, supplying, or using payment means.
 
Acts of forging payment vouchers and illegal payment mean.
 
Illegal gold trading or illegal foreign exchange business.
 
Carrying out banking activities without the permission of a competent state agency according to the provisions of the Law on the State Bank of Vietnam and the Law on Credit Institutions.
 
 
Imprisonment from 03 to 07 years:
 
 
If any subject commits a crime the consequences cause property damage from 300 million VND to less than 1 billion VND.
 
Subjects commit crimes with consequences causing property damage from 1 billion VND to less than 3 billion VND.
 
 
Imprisonment from 12 to 20 years:
 
Subjects commit crimes with the consequences of causing property damage of 3 billion VND or more. During a period of one to five years, the violators are also prohibited from holding certain positions, engaging in certain professions, or working in specific occupations.
 
Therefore, in accordance with the aforementioned laws, using Bitcoin will result in criminal liability if it comes under the category of illegal use of a payment method or illegal issuance or supply of a payment method if the consequences exceed 100 million VND.

He claimed that the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency is coming to an end.

Additionally, the BTC non-believer also cautioned investors to be prepared for the next BTC crash.

The #Bitcoin pumpers on @CNBC throwing nothing but softballs to @novogratz, who basically admitted the entire Bitcoin rally was driven by existing #HODLers buying more. Institutional adoption is over. The #blockchain letter has run out of chain. Get ready for the next crash.

— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 11, 2023

Schiff also chastised CNBC for failing to ask Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz probing questions. He alleged that members of the news staff are 'Bitcoin pumpers.'

What went down? The financial commentator claimed that Novogratz himself stated that BTC's recent rally was driven solely by existing holders buying more. He further stated that it wasn't due to institutional adoption.

Schiff claimed that the excitement surrounding BTC's underlying technology subsided and warned investors of an impending crypto crash. Schiff was also skeptical of the cryptocurrency's long-term viability.

Furthermore, a vocal critic of the cryptocurrency for years­, he shares his views with several Congress members in the U.S. He once compared crypto to a Ponzi scheme.

However, Peter Schiff's pro-crypto investor son, Spencer Schiff, reminded him that he once predicted BTC would be well below $10,000 by 2023. Spencer, on the other hand, remained a little too bullish about the token's future.

You thought bitcoin would be below 10K by now

— Spencer Schiff (@SpencerKSchiff) April 11, 2023

In an interview with Mike Adams last month, Schiff stated that digital gold is one option likely to be adopted by global economies. However, he was skeptical of BTC's ability to become one of the digital currencies in the future.

He also stated that people will begin to transact in digital gold via blockchain technology or private companies tokenizing the metal. Furthermore, a rapid deprecation of the dollar would cause the shift to digital currencies. However, Schiff didn't see BTC as a viable option.

Does bearish sentiment make sense amidst a bullish market? Whether Schiff's prediction of the next BTC crash is true or not remains a matter of debate. Nonetheless, his remarks reflect a broader debate about the future of BTC and other cryptocurrencies, with some investors optimistic about their prospects and others skeptical.

However, predicting the future course of Bitcoin remains a tricky terrain as it has defied market expectations consistently. Only a day ago, BTC crossed the $30,000-price mark and at press time, it was trading at $30,001.98.",investing.com,1372,finance,ES,en,AMBCrypto,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/0fe6daef9237a37c4f14d95dfed1746a_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,8.597617,7855375e6b7c9ce92f9278de7f8e5dcf

Additionally, the price of bitcoin rose above the $30,000 range for the first time in ten months, or since June 2022.


Bitcoin Search Interest Rises as Leading Crypto Asset Taps $30K


On Tuesday, April 11, 2023, bitcoin's price rose above the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 8, 2022. According to statistics from coinmarketcap.com, 
BTC's dominance
 is currently over 47%, the highest it's been in two years. Presently, the hashtags #bitcoin, #
ETH
, and #cryptocurrency are trending on Twitter, and there are currently more than 88,000 tweets with the #cryptocurrency hashtag. At 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, the search term bitcoin 
reached
 a score of 93 out of 100 on Google Trends (GT).




A GT score of 100 denotes the zenith of a search term's popularity in the selected region and time period. It also means that more people are searching for the term than at any other time in the past. On the other hand, a score of zero conveys insufficient data to measure the search term's prevalence. Google Trends data, in terms of search history, dates back to 2004 and the search term bitcoin scored a 2 in June 2011 for the first time.


Furthermore, the search volume for bitcoin has increased in the last 24 hours. Over the last 30 days, the search term has a score of 
64 out of 100
. On Tuesday, the score for bitcoin-related searches for news was 
54 out of 100
. However, on April 10, 2023, the score for bitcoin news jumped to 100. On Tuesday, a significant amount of worldwide interest in bitcoin search queries was related to El Salvador.




El Salvador is followed by regions such as Nigeria, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Switzerland in terms of bitcoin search interest. On Tuesday, some of the vertical trends or related queries included Bitfinex being 
granted a license
 in El Salvador to issue bitcoin bonds. Other stories related to bitcoin that pushed it to the top of searches included the recent discovery of the 
Bitcoin white paper on macOS devices
. Related topics associated with the search term bitcoin include the 
white paper
, Microstrategy, and the name 
Nakamoto
.


Although bitcoin has risen in popularity this week, according to GT data, the search term has not yet reached the all-time high of 100 that it reached in December 2017. During the 2021 bull run, when bitcoin surpassed its 2017 price high, the search term for bitcoin reached a score of 65. As of March 2023, 
GT data shows
 that the score for bitcoin search interest is 23 out of 100. This score is higher than the low of 17 out of 100 that the search term bitcoin received in December 2022.

Airport authorities, who stepped up security, said the threat was a hoax. A probe has been launched.
 
The email, sent from a secure, end-to-end encrypted Proton email service, threatened to execute a suicide bomb attack near the airport's entrance if the ransom was not paid by midnight on April 9. The Nedumbassery police filed a case under Section 66F of the IT Act for cyber terrorism and Section 384 of the IPC for extortion based on the complaint of Kochi airport terminal manager Deepu A S.

The investigation was handed over to the District Crime Branch unit of the Ernakulam Rural Police on Monday. The police suspect the e-mail was sent using the internet facility at the airport. Since Proton Mail is an encrypted facility and does not share e-mail details due to privacy policies, the police are searching for people who accessed the internet facility at the airport to identify the sender.
 
'We are looking for people who accessed the internet facility based on the suspicion that the e-mail was sent from a place near the airport. Even if it is a hoax, we are trying to nab the sender,' a police official said.
 
The spokesperson of the airport confirmed that a hoax e-mail was received but the airport's operation remained unaffected. 'There is a protocol to be followed if the airport receives such a threat.
 
A meeting with the airport's bomb threat assessment committee was convened and a complaint lodged with the police. The probe is on,' said the spokesperson. Two days ago, the official website of Kochi airport was hacked by a hacker group ‘Anonymous Sudan'. But officials said the site experienced unprecedented traffic for three to four hours. It returned to normal by 10pm, they said.

Earle says de-dollarization has begun, citing U.S. dollar weaponization and error-fraught monetary policies.","Economist Peter C. Earle says de-dollarization has begun, emphasizing that 'It's not just the conscription of the dollar in economic warfare, but increasingly error-fraught monetary policy regimes that are driving various interests away from the greenback.' He described: 'By weaponizing dollar dominance and permitting expanding mandates to disorient U.S. monetary policy, the dollar's fate as the lingua franca of world commerce over the long haul may already be sealed.'


Rising De-Dollarization Trend


Economist Peter C. Earle wrote an 
opinion
 piece, titled 'De-dollarization Has Begun,' published by the American Institute of Economic Research last week.


He explained that 'The profound economic disruption experienced by Iran, and more recently Russia, after being evicted from dollar-based trading systems like SWIFT … have led many nations to consider imminent contingency plans,' elaborating:


It's not just the conscription of the dollar in economic warfare, but increasingly error-fraught monetary policy regimes that are driving various interests away from the greenback.


The monetary policy response to the 2008 crisis and the Covid outbreak caused unpredictable fluctuations in the dollar's value, the economist detailed. The pandemic triggered a massive expansionary response in 2020, followed by an initial disregard for the inflation outbreak that subsequently hit four-decade highs 'before an aggressive contractionary shift in policy that destabilized precarious financial institutions was implemented,' he noted.


Earle referenced efforts by several countries in attempting to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar, including the agreement between 
China and Brazil
 to settle trades in local currencies. In addition, the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are reportedly working to 
create a new currency
.


According to the economist, cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and baskets of commodities representative of a given nation are among the U.S. dollar alternatives being discussed. However, he cautioned that 'Moving away from the dollar brings substantial barriers to exit as well as network effects to overcome, owing to historical, technological, financial, and habitual obstacles.'
 
While stating that 'The dollar, in some shape or form, will likely be around for a long time. Perhaps very long,' Earle warned:


By weaponizing dollar dominance and permitting expanding mandates to disorient U.S. monetary policy, the dollar's fate as the lingua franca of world commerce over the long haul may already be sealed.


'So long as the political will to moor US fiscal and monetary policies to those consistent with the constitution of sound money remain an inconversable matter, de-dollarization will proceed. And slower or more quickly, the dollar will lose ground abroad,' he concluded.


A number of economists have made predictions about the future of the U.S. dollar. Nouriel Roubini, aka Dr. Doom, anticipates that the 
global reserve currency system
 will shift from being unipolar to bipolar. Investment manager Larry Lepard said the USD could 
lose most of its value in five years
. Meanwhile, gold bug Peter Schiff recently advised people to 
get rid of their dollars now
 and Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki reiterated his prediction that the 
U.S. dollar is dying
.

While some analysts may argue the move","Share:
 
 
 
Bitcoin price rallied over 10% between April 9 and April 14, marking the highest daily close in over 10 months. While some analysts may argue the move justifies a degree of decoupling from traditional markets, both the S&P 500 and gold are near their highest levels in over six months.
 
Bitcoin's gains and rally above $30,000 also happened while the U.S. Dollar Index (DYX), which measures the currency against a basket of foreign exchanges, reached its lowest level in 12 months.
 
The indicator fell to 100.8 on April 14 from 104.7 one month prior as investors priced in higher odds of further liquidity injections by the United States Federal Reserve.
 
The latest Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting minutes, released on April 12, made explicit reference to the anticipation of a 'mild recession' later in 2023 due to the banking crisis. Even if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.
 
Even if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest 
rates
 further without escalating an economic crisis.
 
While the global economy may deteriorate in the coming months, recent macroeconomic data has been mostly positive. For example, the European Union's statistics office reported that industrial production in the 20 member countries increased 1.5% month on month in February, whereas economists polled by Reuters expected a 1% increase.
 
Furthermore, China's latest macroeconomic data showed an encouraging trend, with exports increasing 14.8% year on year in March, snapping a five-month decline and surprising economists who expected a 7% decline. As a result, China's trade balance for March was $89.2 billion, far exceeding the $39.2 billion market consensus.
 
The contrast between the current economic momentum and the forthcoming recession triggered by higher financing costs and a reduced appetite for risk among lenders causes Bitcoin investors to question the sustainability of the $30,000 support.
 
Let's look at 
Bitcoin derivatives
 metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market environment.
 
Margin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.
 
OKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency's price.
 
 
OKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX
 
The above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio decreased between April 9 and April 11. That is extremely healthy as it shows no leverage has been used to support Bitcoin's price gains, at least not using margin markets. Moreover, given the general bullishness of crypto traders, the current margin lending ratio of 15 is relatively neutral.
 
The long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. In addition, it gathers data from exchange clients' positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.
 
There are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.
 
 
Exchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass
 
Interestingly, despite Bitcoin breaking $30,000 for the first time in 10 months, pro traders have kept their leverage long positions unchanged, according to the long-to-short indicator.
 
For instance, the ratio for Huobi traders stood firm near 0.98 from April 9 until April 14. Meanwhile, at crypto exchange 
Binance
, the long-to-short slightly increased, favoring longs, moving from 1.12 on April 9 to the current 1.14. Lastly, at 
crypto exchange
 OKX, the long-to-short ratio slightly declined, from 1.00 on April 9 to the current 0.91.
 
Moreover, Bitcoin futures traders were not confident enough to add leveraged bullish positions. Thus, even if Bitcoin's price retests $29,000 in terms of derivatives, bulls should be unconcerned because there has been little demand from short-sellers and no excessive leverage from buyers.
 
In other words, Bitcoin's market structure is bullish, where BTC's price can quickly rally another 10% to $33,000, given sellers are currently reluctant to short it.",fxstreet.com,7502,economics,ES,en,,https://editorial.fxstreet.com/miscelaneous/47cfd749-5af9-4b3c-9a18-4b173465-638172874430899653.jpg,False,@FXStreetUpdate,13.655817,c225f7a85d067c7f67f61081a1a9a746

In the picturesque city of Split, Croatia, The Bitcoin Store is leading the charge in transforming the cryptocurrency landscape with their groundbreaking in-person trading platform. Established by cryptocurrency pioneers, the platform aims to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds of cryptocurrency, democratizing the industry and making it accessible to everyone - regardless of their background or experience. With their game-changing approach, The Bitcoin Store is set to revolutionize personal finance and create a trustworthy space for secure transactions.
 
 
The Birth of a Vision: A World Where Crypto Is Accessible to All
 
In 2013, a pair of long-time friends Tomislav V. and Sime B. identified the enormous promise of cryptocurrencies. Observing the challenges many individuals faced when it came to handling or liquidating their digital assets, they established Bitkonan.com, one of the earliest European cryptocurrency exchanges.
 
Later in 2018 after the bull run, when crypto became more ""mainstream,"" they were surprised that the space still appeared daunting and out of reach for many potential users, especially non-tech individuals.
 
In response, they started working on a new idea called ""Bitcoin Store"" - a unique concept that merges the convenience of online exchanges with the accessibility of walk-in stores.
 
""Our goal was to create an environment where even the least tech-savvy individuals could manage cryptocurrencies with just a few clicks,""
 says Tomislav, CEO of Bitcoin Store. 
 
""By introducing a chain of walk-in cryptocurency exchanges in major cities alongside an online platform, we make it possible for anyone to buy, sell, and top up their accounts with cash or crypto instantly. Most importantly, we wanted to become a trustworthy crypto companion for non-tech users in a space that still lacks constructive customer support.""
 
A Platform Built on Accessibility, Convenience, and Education
 
The 
Bitcoin Store
 is more than just a trading platform. It's a movement designed to empower individuals to easily navigate the complex world of digital currencies. 
 
By developing an approachable and friendly brand personality, the company seeks to foster a strong community and establish trust among its users. Ultimately, The Bitcoin Store aims to make the world of cryptocurrency and fintech accessible to all.
 
Brick and mortar cryptocurrency exchange: A Safe Haven in a Landscape Seeking Enhanced Customer Experiences
 
A non-tech user who is unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies may have experienced a sense of confusion or overwhelm, not knowing where to begin when entering the world of crypto.
 
Even with advancements in user experience and abundant knowledge resources, blockchain technology's technical and economic aspects can still be overwhelming.
 
Furthermore, despite all these improvements, majority of users report cases of bad customer support with cold or non-existing communication efforts from exchanges.
 
Physical cryptocurrency exchanges
 serve as an ideal starting point for those new to blockchain technology. These exchanges not only facilitate trading but also function as educational centers.
 
Rather than navigating the complexities of an online exchange, a user can receive guidance from an exchange agent who can help set up a digital wallet and explain the various types of cryptocurrency storage and their differences.
 
Regular users can also benefit from the convenience of visiting a nearby branch for direct support and prompt resolution of potential issues, which is a rarity in the online realm.
 
For instance, when encountering a problem on an online exchange, the only available option is usually contacting customer service and potentially waiting hours for a response.
 
Furthermore, Bitcoin Store walk-in cryptocurrency exchanges instill trust and security in their users. Before committing to any transactions, a simple internet search can confirm that the exchange is a regulated company adhering to the highest security standards.
 
The Future of Personal Finance: Expanding Services and the Store Finance (SEF) Token
 
The Bitcoin Store plans to introduce new features such as unique IBAN accounts, physical/virtual credit cards, staking, lending, and loans to further its mission. 
 
At the heart of this evolving ecosystem will be their new project - Store Finance (SEF), a new feature designed to be the dedicated utility token within the Bitcoin Store network.
 
By holding and using SEF tokens, users will enjoy numerous benefits, including:
 
Fee reduction
SEF staking rewards
Cashback on a physical VISA credit card
Early access to new crypto projects via the Bitcoin Store launchpad
Recommendation program benefits
Crypto lending and loan program benefits
 
Join the Revolution: The Store Finance (SEF) Presale
 
The second round of the Store Finance (SEF) presale is set to commence on April 18, 2023, and will run until April 25, 2023.
The pre-sale price of tokens will be a fixed 0.2€ per token.
Bitcoin Store guarantees a redemption price of 0.1€ per token in the next 2 years!
The token will be available for purchase exclusively on the 
Bitcoin Store launchpad site
.
 
Don't miss out on the opportunity to join this groundbreaking ecosystem and help shape the future of personal finance.

The center 'will enable law enforcement to tackle crime that takes place using blockchain technology,' Chainalysis described.


Canada's Cryptocurrency Investigations Centre


The police service of Calgary, the largest city in the western Canadian province of Alberta and the largest metro area within the three Prairie Provinces region, announced last week that it is creating a 'Cryptocurrency Investigations Centre.' The announcement explains:


The Calgary Police Service is entering into a unique partnership with Chainalysis, a global blockchain data platform, to help combat crypto-crime.


'The creation and implementation of the Western Canada Cryptocurrency Investigations Centre will strengthen our ability to ensure the public safety of citizens, allow for proactive policing, enhance technical investigative skills and provide expert training resources for law enforcement,' the police noted.


According to the announcement, Calgarians reported losses totaling $13.9 million due to cryptocurrency-related crimes to the police last year, and an additional $3.2 million has been reported so far this year.


'Cybercrimes, particularly cryptocurrency scams, can be difficult for law enforcement to fully investigate due to a variety of complex factors, including various international locations and jurisdictions, sophisticated criminal techniques and quickly advancing technology,' the police stressed.
 
Furthermore, the announcement details:


Together, with Chainalysis, the Calgary Police Service Cyber Forensics Unit has created the CPS Blockchain Investigation Team (BIT), dedicated to support cryptocurrency and blockchain-related investigations.


Chainalysis described the new center as 'an innovative regional center that will enable law enforcement to tackle crime that takes place using blockchain technology.'


The blockchain firm's research indicates that there has been a significant surge in the usage and adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets in Canada since 2019. In 2022, Canada ranked 22nd on the firm's 
Global Crypto Adoption Index
, which is an improvement from 26th in 2021 and 24th in 2020.

In this paper, the generalised extreme value distribution (GEVD) model is employed to estimate financial risk in the form of return levels and the value at risk (VaR) for the two exchange rates, BitCoin/US dollar (BTC/USD) and the South African rand/US dollar (ZAR/USD). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) responsible for developing supervisory guidelines for banks and financial trading desks recommended that VaR be computed and reported. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method is used to estimate the parameters of the GEVD. The estimated risk values are used to compare the riskiness of the two exchange rates and help both traders and investors to define their position in forex trading. This is to helping understanding the risk they are taking when they convert their savings/investments to BitCoin instead of the South African currency, the rand. The high extreme value index associated with the BTC/USD compared to the ZAR/USD implies that BitCoin is riskier than the rand. The BTC/USD has higher values of expected extreme/tail losses of 13.44%, 18.02%, and 23.41% at short (6 months), medium (12 months), and long (24 months) terms, compared to the ZAR/USD expected extreme/tail losses of 2.40%, 2.84%, and 3.28%, respectively. The computed VaR estimates for losses of USD 0.17, USD 0.22, and USD 0.38 per dollar invested in BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99%, compared to ZAR/USD's USD 0.03, USD 0.03, and USD 0.04 at the respective confidence levels, confirm the high risk associated with BitCoin. The conclusion drawn from this study is that BTC/USD is riskier than ZAR/USD, despite the rand being a developing country's currency, hence perceived as being risky. The perception is that the rand is riskier than BitCoin and perceptions do influence exchange rates. Kupiec's backtest results confirmed the model's adequacy. These findings are helpful to investors, traders, and risk managers when deciding on trading positions for the two currencies.


 










 


Cryptocurrencies are decentralised currencies that are transacted without the regulations of a reserve bank or financial intermediaries. Blockchain technology is used to process transactions. BitCoin is on top of the list of traded cryptocurrencies in terms of traded volume with a market capitalisation of USD 452.1 billion (
https://www.forbes.com
, accessed on 7 March 2023). Like most technical products, the uptake may be initially slow, but the above literature suggests more significant use of cryptocurrency going into the future. According to Deloitte, 'more than 2300 US businesses accepted and used BitCoin, and other digital assets for a host of investment, operational, and transactional purposes in 2020' (
https://www2.deloitte.com
, accessed on 7 March 2023). 
With the collapse of the Bretton Woods gold backed currency system (
Garber 1993
), the current currencies in use are viewed as fiat currencies. Fiat money is a government issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Fiat currencies have lost some of their lustre in times of war, showing that they are not as good as gold. 
Indeed, cryptocurrencies such as BitCoin are exchangeable with fiat currencies and are a faster way to exchange currency, even though some economic researchers argue that the BitCoin fails the three traditional requirements of a currency (store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account (
Yermack 2015
). 
Lu
 (
2023
) noted that if BitCoin is accepted as a kind of new currency, it is likely that it will improve lives and help to avoid the problem of fetishism that always excludes the majority from its games.
Since BitCoin is not backed by any central bank or government, its users and traders are vulnerable to higher risk (volatility). 
BitCoin is a relatively new investment asset and evidence of its use as a currency is available on the given surveys below. As with the global trend, cryptocurrency trading, particularly BitCoin, is gaining a lot of momentum in South Africa 
Arı
 (
2022
), (
https://www.altcointrader.co.za/
, accessed on 7 March 2021).Thus, according to a survey by triple A, a blockchain technology company, there is a steady increase in movements of people's savings and investments between the rand and BitCoin (
https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-south-africa-2022/
, accessed on 5 April 2023). 
Risk sentiment is how financial market participants (traders and investors) feel and behave, e.g., towards emerging countries' currencies. The behaviour is particularly important when the economic outlook of one or some emerging countries is poor or deteriorating, economic data is disappointing or downright negative, and markets are exhibiting high levels of price volatility. Those emerging countries that maybe doing well economically may still have their currencies weakened or affected through contagion. Investors move their currencies from emerging countries to 'safe haven assets' which are not affected by this negative sentiment around emerging countries.
While the rand is a government backed currency, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) adopted a flexible exchange rate post independence in 1994 (
Van Der Merwe 1996
). This approach is the market driven pricing of currency, mainly based on the supply and demand of money in the market. The rand is then affected by speculation (hence perceived as being risky), foreign investor sentiment and contagion emanating from association with similar economies (
Pretorius and De Beer 2002
). 
Joale
 (
2011, p. 4
) sums it up as follows: 'The reduction in controls relating to the exchange rate market and capital flows have resulted in South Africa experiencing a significant increase in the volatility of both securities (stock and bond) prices and the exchange rate of the rand against major world currencies, especially the U.S. Dollar', and hence the perception of a very risky rand is not without merit.
Financial time series (including BitCoin and rand) are leptokurtic in nature, that is, they tend to exhibit fat tails and excess peaks from the mean (
Danielsson 2011
). Fat tails are responsible for extreme return; hence the use of extreme value theory (EVT) models is recommended in efforts to correctly capture the financial risk of these financial assets.EVT is the theory of measuring and modelling extreme events (large fluctuations). The field of EVT was pioneered by 
Fisher and Tippett
 (
1928
) and 
Pickands
 (
1975
). The purpose of this study is to fit the extreme value theory (EVT)-based generalised extreme value distribution (GEVD) to compare the riskiness of the two currencies by estimating return levels and the value at risk (VaR). The GEVD is preferred as it analyses extreme risk. 
Edem and Ndengo
 (
2021
) showed that GEVD adequately captures tail-related features for financial indices in developing economies such as Rwanda.
In the modelling of financial extreme tail-related risk using the EVT, the extreme value index (EVI), also known as the shape parameter of the distribution, dictates the tail behaviour of the returns' distribution, according to 
Rached and Larsson
 (
2019
). This parameter is so important and is an indicator of how the tail of a distribution decays, according to 
Beirlant et al.
 (
2005
). A lot of studies have been carried out to refine the methods of estimating EVI. Work includes 
Dekkers et al.
 (
1989
), 
Beirlant et al.
 (
1996
, 
2005
), 
Caeiro et al.
 (
2005
), and 
Cai et al.
 (
2013
). The parameter itself is a measure of risk when working with the EVT as loss distributions, and it also influences the estimation of risk measures such as return levels, value at risk (VaR), and expected shortfall (ES) (
Penalva et al. 2016
).
The return level is defined as, say, the maximum loss (exceedance) over an average period of, say, one year. It measures the highest (extreme quantile) to occur within a certain period. Therefore, the return value is the level that is expected to be equalled or exceeded on average once every interval of time with a probability of 
p
 (
McNeil et al. 2015
). 
Jakata and Chikobvu
 (
2022
) defined the waiting time as 'the waiting period before observing a maximum loss of the same magnitude'. 
Gilli and Këllezi
 (
2006
) suggested that the maximum loss of an investment portfolio can be better estimated by the return value (level), rather than the more conservative measure of the VaR.
The VaR is a statistic that quantifies the riskiness of a financial portfolio of assets. It is the largest value or amount expected to be lost over a specified time horizon, i.e., daily, weekly, or ten days, at a pre-defined statistical confidence level. 
Hull
 (
2006, p. 198
) defined VaR as the value that 'compresses all Greek letters for all the market variables underlying a portfolio into a single number'. Investors and practitioners rely heavily on VaR as a risk measure, even though it is not globally sub-additive. The VaR metric is popular because its practical advantages outweigh its theoretical disadvantages. According to 
Danielsson et al.
 (
2013
), VaR is sub-additive in most practical situations, which is in line with the diversification concept of modern portfolio theory.
This paper compares the riskiness of the BitCoin returns with the South African rand returns using GEVD-based return levels and VaR. The theory of extremes is backed by mathematical theory and governs the behaviour of extremes (outliers). Just as the central limit theorem governs the normal distribution behaviour of data when a large data set is available, 
Fisher and Tippett
 (
1928
) and 
Pickands
 (
1975
) proved a similar theorem for those extremes (outliers).The theorem applies to a population that may exhibit extremes. The normal distribution-based models have been discredited, as they are largely blamed for the global financial crisis of 2008/9. The originality of the work in this paper should be viewed within the context of applying already established statistical distributions to compare extreme risk in BitCoin and rand returns. Similarities and hence conclusions to other developing countries can be inferred, but each developing country's currency warrants a separate study and hence a separate conclusion.
The paper provides scarce empirical evidence when comparing a risky developing country's currency, the rand, to BitCoin. The normal distribution-based model empirical evidence is discredited in favour of extreme value theory (EVT) distributions through empirical evidence, such as that provided using the GEVD model.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: 
Section 2
 presents the literature review. The methodology is in 
Section 3
. Results and discussions are in 
Section 4
 and 
Section 5
 concludes.
Dasman
 (
2021
) used a statistical test approach in comparing the average returns and volatility of BitCoin against the Indonesian Composite Index, and gold. The BitCoin average returns were significantly higher than the financial assets studied. This would be consistent with mean-variance portfolio theory, which suggests a higher yield for riskier assets (
Markowitz 1959
).
Other studies confirmed the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency, including 
Zhang et al.
 (
2018
), 
Katsiampa et al.
 (
2019
), and 
Hu et al.
 (
2019
). This feature has been suggested to be caused by speculation (perceived as being risky), insufficient regulatory measures, and spurious issues, amongst other reasons given by 
Dowd
 (
2014
), and 
Cheah and Fry
 (
2015
). However, 
Blau
 (
2017
), found no evidence of speculation as the reason for the high volatility amongst cryptocurrencies.
While the issue of fat tails has been raised long before the global financial crisis of 2008, such as in the work of 
Mandelbrot
 (
1963
) and 
Fama
 (
1963
, 
1965
), the widespread implementation in practice has lagged behind till post the global financial crisis (
Danielsson 2011
), (
Makhwiting et al. 2014
) and (
Makatjane and Moroke 2021
). 
Cirillo and Taleb
 (
2020
) emphasised the importance of fat-tailed models in extremes driven by disasters such as pandemics, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic. An extreme asset price change can significantly affect the performance of an investment over a long time period (e.g., a year) or even threaten the stability of the whole financial market system, and hence should not be downplayed in any serious policy discussion, according to 
Taleb
 (
2020
).
While the value at risk (VaR) is one of the most commonly used risk measures in finance because of its ability to compress all Greeks to a single value, it has shortcomings according to 
Chou and Wang
 (
2014
) and, 
Hull
 (
2006
). 
Rockafellar and Uryasev
 (
2002
) showed that the traditional normal distribution-based VaR is not only incoherent, but also fails to precisely estimate the risk of loss when the loss distributions have ‘fat tails' unless EVT distributions are used. 'This significantly discredits the accuracy of the traditional normal distribution based VaR risk measure' according to 
Chen
 (
2018
). To address the normal distribution-based VaR weaknesses highlighted above, the EVT theory-based GEVD is suggested in this study.

162,What is the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?,josiahmakori,2023-04-24 00:00:00,date,https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-rainbow-chart,coingecko.com,What is the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart and what do the different colors mean?,"The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a technical analysis tool that visualizes the historical price trends of BTC and predict its future price movements. It is a multi-colored chart that plots bitcoin's price movements over time against a logarithmic scale, with each color representing a different price range, where blue is the lowest and dark red is the highest. 
 
Key Takeaways






The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a helpful tool for visualizing the price performance of bitcoin over time. 






By utilizing a color-coded spectrum, this tool displays various price ranges and offers a quick, easy-to-read visual of bitcoin's current position compared to past trends.






The chart consists of seven distinct color bands, with the lowest price range denoted by blue and the highest price range symbolized by dark red.






You can use the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart to recognize potential entry and exit points based on the current bitcoin price within the color bands. 




 
Though short-term speculators generate most of the trading volume in the crypto markets, many individuals prefer to 
HODL
 cryptocurrencies for the long term. These investors often strive to purchase 
bitcoin (BTC)
 at the end of a bear market and hold it for extended periods, ideally selling towards the end of a bull market. 


Predicting the optimal timing for entry and exit can be challenging but traders are always keen to take on the challenge. To make things easier, analysts have created various indicators and models to forecast future prices and provide perspective on bitcoin's price behavior. One such tool is the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, designed to help investors understand bitcoin's price in relation to its past market cycles.





BTC, and 
cryptocurrencies
 in general, often experience high volatility, and you can easily be scared by its fast highs and lows. However, if you consider bitcoin's logarithmic chart, you can see its evolution since inception against the dollar and a high valuation tendency throughout the years. If the projection continues, it suggests your BTC holdings would have a higher chance of increasing if you hold for long periods. 




Nevertheless, bitcoin's ascending curve hides many secrets, which we can uncover by dividing it using rainbow colors, as seen in the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart.

Blockchaincenter.net


The Rainbow, with the color segments, shows when the asset is oversold – blue and green segments, or overbought – orange, red, and purple segments. As such, you can use the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart to identify the potentially ideal moment to purchase or sell BTC. Generally, when BTC is in the blue/green segment, it can be the right moment to buy. It can be the right moment to sell when it's in the orange, red, and purple zones. 


Beyond recognizing entry and exit points, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart also illustrates the time value of money and the dollar, where what used to be considered expensive in the past can be seen as cheap today. For instance, in November 2013, to purchase 1 BTC at $1 seemed expensive – red zone. However, in 2017, BTC at $1 was considered a bargain – blue zone. 




Although the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is not a foolproof indicator for predicting BTC's future price movements, it provides a historical context and a visual representation of the different market phases. You can use it in conjunction with other indicators and analysis methods as a reference point to make informed investment decisions. 





The BTC Rainbow Chart consists of 9 color bands. Together, these bands make up a rainbow. Let's analyze each color band and how you can apply them in trading. That said, this article is not meant as financial advice, so do your own research before buying and trading digital assets.


Blue = Basically a Fire Sale


When the price of BTC is in the blue zone, the market experiences a significant dip or correction, and prices are relatively low compared to historical values. The color signals a potential buying opportunity, as it may be an excellent time to invest in BTC at a discounted price. However, it's essential for investors to research the dip's exact causes before entering and committing their capital.  


Blue-Green = Buy! 


The blue-green zone on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart represents a slight recovery from a dip or correction. The market is showing signs of strength, and it may present an opportunity for investors to buy as the price rises. This color represents a good buying opportunity for investors looking to accumulate more coins.


Green = Accumulate


The green zone indicates BTC is trading at a fair value, and investors can consider accumulating more coins. It signifies that BTC is in a stable phase, and its price is expected to increase gradually over time. For investors that are bullish on BTC, they can consider buying and holding in this phase.


Light Green = Still Cheap


The light green zone indicates that BTC is still undervalued relative to its historical price trend. This color signals a further opportunity to buy more BTC as its price is expected to increase significantly. However, investors should always remember that crypto market conditions can be unpredictable; hence, you should never invest more than you are comfortable losing. 


Yellow = HODL! 


The yellow zone on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart represents a market phase where the focus changes from accumulating to holding onto BTC as an investment. The color signals that the asset is trading at a fair value and is expected to remain stable in the near future. Investors who are confident in Bitcoin's long-term potential may choose to hold onto their coins at this stage.


Light Orange = Is This a Bubble? 


The light orange zone indicates that the market may enter a speculative phase. It signals that bitcoin's price is increasing at an accelerated rate, where critics are labeling it a bubble. Investors should be cautious in this phase and may consider taking profits, especially in the case of active traders.


Orange = FOMO Intensifies


The orange zone on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart represents a phase of the market where investors should maintain caution. It signifies that bitcoin's price is rising at an unsustainable rate, and more investors may be tempted to buy due to FOMO (fear of missing out) as the price rises. 


Red = Sell! 


The red zone on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart represents a market phase where investors may consider selling their bitcoin investments. The band signals that bitcoin's price has reached an unsustainable level, and a market correction is expected. There is an opportunity here for investors to consider taking profits in this phase, especially if they have a significant amount of bitcoin. 


Dark Red = Maximum Bubble Territory


The dark red zone indicates that the market is in a bubble and the price of bitcoin is significantly overvalued. The band suggests that investors should be extremely cautious and may consider selling their bitcoin investments if they have invested for short-term gains. The market may experience a significant correction or crash, and investors who hold bitcoin in this phase may experience considerable losses.





As mentioned, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart visually represents bitcoin's historical price trends. It is intended to provide information that can help investors decide when to buy, hold, or sell bitcoin. While the chart can be a helpful tool for investors, it's essential to understand that it's not a perfect predictor of future market conditions. It's based on historical price trends and doesn't account for unforeseen events or market conditions that could affect bitcoin's price in the future.


Additionally, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is just one of many tools available when making investment decisions. It's essential to research and analyze multiple sources, including market trends, news articles, and also taking a look at 
on-chain data
, before making any investment decisions.


That being said, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart can be a helpful tool as it provides a quick snapshot of bitcoin's price relative to historical price trends, and can help investors make informed decisions about when to enter and exit the market.


Overall, the accuracy of the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart depends on various factors, including market conditions, investor sentiment, and unforeseen events that could affect bitcoin's price. While the chart can be a helpful tool in trading, you should combine it with technical and 
fundamental analysis
 to make better-informed investment decisions.





While the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart can be a helpful tool in informing investment decisions, it's important to note that it has its limitations. First, it's based solely on historical price trends and doesn't account for unforeseen events or market conditions that could affect bitcoin's price in the future.


Second, the chart's color zones are subjective and open to interpretation. The definitions of the colors may vary among different chart providers; for example, when the price was hovering at around $27.5K on April 22nd, lookintobitcoin's Rainbow chart indicated that the price was within the lowest zone (blue), while blockchaincenter's placed it near the top of the next lowest zone (blue-green).


Thirdly, it doesn't provide any fundamental analysis of Bitcoin's underlying technology or the broader cryptocurrency market. While price trends can provide some insight into market sentiment, they don't necessarily reflect the long-term potential of a particular cryptocurrency or technology.


Finally, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is just one of many tools investors should use to make investment decisions. It's important to consider multiple sources of information, including market trends, news articles, and expert opinions, before making any investment decisions.





The original Bitcoin Rainbow Chart was created by a Reddit user named Azop as a humorous way to display bitcoin's price history. Later, a BitcoinTalk user named Trolololo developed version 2.0 by pairing the rainbow chart with logarithmic regression. 


Logarithmic regression is the opposite of exponential growth and is commonly used to track change in various fields, including asset prices. The pairing made sense in the BTC context, as it takes more and more capital to push BTC higher, resulting in diminishing returns. 


Combining the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart with logarithmic growth makes the model applicable in the present and future. Additionally, it continuously adjusts based on new price data, increasing accuracy over time. Thus, its usefulness and precision will only improve with ongoing recalibration.





The Ethereum Rainbow Chart


The Ethereum Rainbow Chart visually represents 
Ethereum's historical price trends
, similar to the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart. Like the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart is designed to help users make informed decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell Ethereum based on historical price trends.


Like the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart uses a color-coded system to indicate different price levels. The chart typically features nine colors, each corresponding to a specific price range and investment strategy.

The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a visual tool for making informed decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell bitcoin. The chart provides a quick snapshot of bitcoin's price relative to historical price trends and can help investors identify potential buying or selling opportunities. When using the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, beyond understanding each color band, investors should also should determine their investment goals and risk tolerance. 


However, it's important to note that the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is not a perfect predictor of future market conditions. It should be used with technical and fundamental analysis tools to make better-informed investment decisions. The chart also comes with limitations, such as its reliance on historical price trends and subjective color coding, and investors should do their own research before investing in any digital assets.

'This requires a thorough analysis and delicate internal work by the five countries to reach a consensus,' according to Russia's Foreign Ministry.


Member Countries Discuss BRICS Expansion


Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated during a news briefing on Thursday that Russia has been holding regular negotiations with its BRICS partners regarding the group's possible expansion, local news outlet Tass reported. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.


Zakharova explained:


The entire range of issues associated with this is being discussed at BRICS sherpas and sous-sherpas meetings, and, of course, this requires a thorough analysis and delicate internal work by the five countries to reach a consensus.


The Foreign Ministry's spokesperson added that while the discussions occur regularly, it is premature to reveal any specifics about the approval procedure at this time.


Emphasizing that the BRICS nations are focusing their attention on the group's expansion as the topic is highly relevant at present, Zakharova noted that these issues 'are discussed by the five heads of state and foreign ministers,' noting that 'Specifically, the declaration adopted at the 14th BRICS summit in Beijing issued instructions to work out appropriate guiding principles, standards, criteria, and procedures.'
 
Earlier this week, South Africa's ambassador to the BRICS group, Anil Sooklal, revealed that 
19 countries
 have expressed an interest in joining the BRICS economic bloc. 'What will be discussed is the expansion of BRICS and the modalities of how this will happen,' he said, elaborating:


Thirteen countries have formally asked to join and another six have asked informally. We are getting applications to join every day.


The BRICS nations have been pushing to gain 
global influence
 and shifting away from U.S. dollar reliance. In addition, the economic group is working on creating a 
common currency
 for member countries. Some economists have warned that a BRICS currency could 
erode the USD's dominance
.

Commenting on de-dollarization on a 'massive scale,' he stressed: 'It's a weaponization of our U.S. dollar against the world … It's all coming down fast right now.'


Robert Kiyosaki on De-Dollarization on ‘Massive Scale'


The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, is back with more dire predictions about the U.S. economy, the dollar, and global economic chaos. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. Over 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.


During his Rich Dad radio show, which aired last week, Kiyosaki discussed de-dollarization with Andy Schectman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals Investments.


Schectman began by highlighting recent events that led to what he described as 'de-dollarization on a massive scale,' including the 
meeting
 between French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 'When our allies are breaking rank, it is going to speed things up, I believe, tremendously,' he emphasized.


Kiyosaki concurred, stating:


It's a weaponization of our U.S. dollar against the world and the world's pissed off about it right now … It's all coming down fast right now. It's going faster and faster.


The two proceeded to discuss the catalysts for the rising de-dollarization trend across the globe. They include Saudi Arabia entering trade alliances with China, Russia, India, and Pakistan to step further away from U.S. dollar reliance and China 
settling
 trades with Brazil in local currencies. They also mentioned the 
BRICS nations' de-dollarization efforts
 and the economic bloc potentially launching a 
new currency
. Several countries, such as 
Indonesia
, are also following the BRICS' lead and shifting away from the U.S. dollar for trade settlements. The BRICS countries are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.


Gresham's Law and Triffin's Dilemma ‘Violated'


'There are two basic laws that are violated,' the Rich Dad Poor Dad author explained. 'When Nixon, in ‘71, took the dollar off the gold standard, what happened was that he violated Gresham's Law, and Gresham's Law says when bad money enters a system, good money goes into hiding.'


Kiyosaki continued: 'The second law is Triffin's Dilemma and that happened in 1944. What happened in 1944 at the Bretton Woods agreement in New Hampshire was the world said that we agree that the world will trade in U.S. dollars … but now the Bretton Woods agreement is falling apart.'


The famous author added: 'Triffin's Dilemma meant the U.S. had to supply dollars to every central bank throughout the world, so we had to print probably quadrillions of dollars.' However, he stressed that when the BRICS nations gang up against 'the playground bully, the U.S.,' they say: 'Take your dollars back.' Kiyosaki then warned:


When those dollars come roaring back into America, we have a thing called hyperinflation, and every time there's hyperinflation, guess what happens, dictators arise and when dictators arise, the murder starts.
 
Schectman shared: 'You will wake up Monday morning and it'll be: ‘Oh my God, what just happened.' Because in the middle of the night, while we were all sleeping, all of the OPEC members who are all on the 
Belt and Road Initiative
, they'll stand arm-in-arm and say: ‘We've decided … we're going to take the yuan until the new BRICS currency is out.' Whatever they say, those dollars will start flooding home before we can even wake up and we'll wake up to interest rates spiking … and the whole system in chaos.'


Citing a video by Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio explaining 'the changing of world order,' Kiyosaki stressed:


Out of all this chaos … the dollar is going to come back in trillions — hyperinflation, war breaks out, starvation increases … I hate to say this, and I hope I'm wrong, it's the end of the American Empire. It happens all the time and it doesn't happen peacefully.


Meanwhile, Kiyosaki is planning to buy more gold. He tweeted Monday: 'Gold to crash. Steve Van Meter, whom I respect, predicts gold to crash to $1,000. He states markets are tired of waiting for gold to go higher. If gold drops to $1,000 I will buy more. I am an investor, not a trader. To me, gold, silver, and bitcoin are real money. To me cash is trash.'

'Both the current sanctions that have been imposed against our country and the new additional steps that Brussels and Washington are probably thinking about now will hit the global economy hard,' the spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin said.


Sanctions Will Lead to Global Economic Crisis, Says Russian Official


Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday that anti-Russia sanctions will have a detrimental impact on the global economy, with the potential to spark a global economic crisis.


'We proceed from the fact that in any case, both the current sanctions that have been imposed against our country and the new additional steps that Brussels and Washington are probably thinking about now will hit the global economy hard,' Putin's spokesperson was quoted by Tass publication as saying. He added:


This can only lead us down a path towards a global economic crisis.


The Group of Seven (G7) countries are reportedly considering a near-total ban on exports to Russia. Despite already halting exports of various items, such as military-related products and luxury goods, the new measures being considered may widen the trade embargo to include used cars, tires, cosmetics, and apparel.
 
Responding to a question about the G7 countries considering new anti-Russia sanctions, Peskov said: 'Of course, we are monitoring this very carefully, of course, we are aware that the United States and EU countries are actively considering new additional sanctions. We must not forget that no country in the world has ever faced sanctions to such an extent as we have. Therefore, we adapt, develop, engage in long-term development plans and take into account the dangers that lie behind such thoughts of our opponents.'


Meanwhile, the BRICS nations — which comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are working on 
creating a common currency
 that would reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday that Russia is ready to take part in the discussions on the creation of a BRICS currency.

He further stressed: 'All the bad stuff that they're saying is going to happen if we don't raise the debt ceiling is guaranteed to happen because we do raise the debt ceiling.'


Peter Schiff on U.S. Debt Default


Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff warned Monday on the Peter Schiff Show podcast that the United States will default on its debt obligations and that raising the debt ceiling will have devastating consequences.


Commenting on politicians claiming that the U.S. debt ceiling must be raised 'because we pay our bills,' the economist argued: 'We never pay our bills … We have $31.7 trillion in debt. That's $31.7 trillion of bills that we have not paid. We didn't pay them. We borrowed the money. And we want to keep on borrowing the money. Nobody wants to pay any of these bills.' Schiff cautioned:


It's only a question of time. It's not a question of if. It's just a question of when. We will default on our debt. All the bad stuff that they're saying is going to happen if we don't raise the debt ceiling is guaranteed to happen because we do raise the debt ceiling.


He explained that eventually, the borrowing and money printing by the Federal Reserve will precipitate a financial and currency crisis. 'It's not about America not wanting to borrow. It's about the rest of the world not wanting to lend because they know we're not going to pay them back. And one of the reasons they know that is because we've already told them. We are telling them that repeatedly in the debt ceiling battle,' he opined.


The economist detailed that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations in two forms. The first is 'an honest default where the government just doesn't pay back bondholders' and the second is 'a dishonest default where we pay with inflation.' In the latter case, he stressed that the Federal Reserve will just 'print money and pay people back with worthless or near-worthless paper.'
 
Regarding commentary in the media framing the debt ceiling as the problem, Schiff argued that the problem is actually the debt. He cautioned:


The problem is that Congress and the president keep running up more and more debt and every time we get to the ceiling, we either raise it or suspend it … The problem is that we keep raising the ceiling, not that we won't raise it. In fact, the threat is that we raise it again.


Do you agree with Peter Schiff that the U.S. will default on its debt and raising the debt ceiling will make the problem worse? Let us know in the comments section below.

170,A very theatrical Bitcoin bet collapses,DEREK ROBERTSON,2023-05-03 00:00:00,date,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2023/05/03/a-very-theatrical-bitcoin-bet-collapses-00095112,politico.com,,"A crypto-world gentleman's wager was resolved 
this week — and not in favor of the Bitcoin booster who sparked it.
Back in March, my colleague Ben Schreckinger 
reported on a bet
 between gadfly venture capitalist Balaji Srinivisan and pseudonymous economics blogger James Medlock. The terms: Srinivasan bet Medlock that 1 Bitcoin, then (and still) hovering just below $30,000, would be worth more than $1 million in 90 days as a result of catastrophic 'hyperinflation.'
It's possible Srinivasan truly believed it would happen in the immediate aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse. And it's possible he simply wanted to pump up the value of Bitcoin and overtake a theoretical loss on the bet with gains in its overall value. (Read Ben for more on that.)
However, it's also possible he was just 
shitposting
 in the brash, consequence-disregarding manner that's almost a requirement to participate in the Bitcoin community — an act that has subtly turned the gears of history in the modern internet era.
But hold that thought. Whatever Srinivasan's motivation, on Monday he lost the bet. (Inflation 
modestly decreased
 in March.) Or rather, he surrendered, 45 days ahead of its date of expiry — 'The million dollar bet is now closed out by mutual agreement,' 
he tweeted
, adding that he donated $1 million to charity and paid out $500,000 to Medlock. (Nice work, if you can get it.)
But why did Balaji surrender so readily? Isn't there still a chance the U.S. economy will teeter over the edge in the shadow of the debt ceiling and ongoing bank collapses, driving Bitcoin at long last to the moon?
His explanation is almost depressingly predictable. In 
an essay
 emblazoned with the photo caption 'I burned a MILLION to tell you they're printing TRILLIONS,' Srinivasan reframes the bet as a familiar exercise in libertarian consciousness-raising about 'the next Fed-precipitated global meltdown,' sparked by a combination of the U.S. government's (allegedly) reckless spending and the Federal Reserve continuing to 
hike interest rates
.
Doomsaying about the fate of fiat currency and the global economy is probably the only requirement more stringent for being a Bitcoiner in good standing than the aforementioned shitposting. In that light, Srinivasan's explanation strains credulity, if it doesn't insult the reader's intelligence. Srinivasan is an almost recreationally wealthy man to whom $1.5 million is a relatively paltry sum. But he didn't get that way by lighting money on fire just to prove a point he's already made, many times over.
Jeremiah Johnson, co-founder of the center-left Center For New Liberalism and a staunch believer in old-fashioned fiat currency, proposed another explanation in a 
blog post
 published this morning. Johnson suggests that another power inspired the doomed quixotic bet — a power strong enough to propel 
presidents into office
, to sidetrack 
Mars-minded moguls
 and to end 
era-defining artists' careers
.
The power of posting.
'Remember – posting is the most powerful force in the universe. Posting is seductive and makes you believe all your ideas are brilliant. It always feels like a good idea to hit the Send button,' Johnson writes.
'This is ultimately why Balaji engaged in an absurd bet of one million dollars against one bitcoin, when he could have just bought 40 bitcoin for that money. He could have just logged off and bought more bitcoin, but that would mean logging off. It would mean NOT hitting the send button, and letting a joke at his expense go unanswered, and that cannot be. The power of posting is undefeated.'
It's a difficult argument to refute. Posting has brought the mighty low, and it made Medlock a cool half-million dollars for doing basically nothing. The resolution of this bet tells us less about the health of the economy, Bitcoin's power as an inflation hedge, or American trust in institutions, and more about how the compulsion to 
post
, to be 
correct
, and to win social media's competition for status and influence remains mostly undefeated.
This is not to say that the impulse is necessarily wasted, or unproductive. It's driven real-world innovation, wealth creation, and intellectual discourse: The crypto ecosystem, which flat-out would not exist without posting, has a trillion-plus global market cap; Tesla built its market valuation largely by Reddit word-of-mouth and then used it to innovate in battery technology; even the fiery debate over an entirely theoretical existential AI risk is an ongoing exercise in posting, dating back to the 
era of the BBS
.
Srinivasan might have posted his way out of $1.5 million, but the act remains his rock, his sacrament, his safe harbor. Last year he published 
an entire book
 about how communities built around posting will eventually supplant, or at least compete with, the nation-state. I was skeptical of the idea when I wrote about the book in September, and I remain that way. But ironically, after considering his bet and our entire modern era of tech innovation in light of the sheer will to post, I'm now far more sympathetic to it than I otherwise might have been.
 






Meta is throwing up a bright red flag 
to warn internet users about scams playing off the ChatGPT hype.
In the company's 
Q1 security report
 released this morning, its chief information security officer Guy Rosen noted they've blocked more than 1,000 malicious links since March that use ChatGPT as a pretense to get users' sensitive information.
As it turns out, the novel, 
potentially security-breaking imitative capabilities
 of ChatGPT are 
not 
the danger at play with these links — it's the hype around AI itself. Scammers are simply leveraging the novelty of, and extreme levels of interest in, ChatGPT to get users to think they're accessing it when they're really just installing malicious spyware.
'This is not unique to the generative AI space,' Rosen writes. 'As an industry we've seen this across other topics popular in their time, such as crypto scams fueled by the interest in digital currency. The generative AI space is rapidly evolving and bad actors know it, so we should all be vigilant.'






































The outspoken FTC chair Lina Khan 
has an op-ed in the New York Times today laying out her vision for how AI should be regulated.
Khan, who's made a firm regulatory hand with the tech industry a key part of her 
neo-Brandesian approach
 to competition law, argues that the rise of AI risks locking in the dominance of already-existing tech giants like Google and Microsoft. Therefore, she writes, the FTC should use any tool in its arsenal to prevent said companies from 'picking winners or losers' in the AI boom.
'Enforcers have the dual responsibility of watching out for the dangers posed by new A.I. technologies while promoting the fair competition needed to ensure the market for these technologies develops lawfully,' Khan writes.
She also warns about the opacity with which AI models are trained, saying that 'Because they may be fed information riddled with errors and bias, these technologies risk automating discrimination.' Given how active Khan's FTC has been investigating 
other emerging technologies
, the op-ed feels decidedly like a shot across the bow for the AI era.

The court has also ordered Steynberg to pay a civil monetary penalty of a similar amount. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) conceded that orders requiring payment of funds 'may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.'


‘Largest Fraudulent Scheme Involving Bitcoin' in the History of the CFTC


A United States Federal Court recently handed down a default judgment and permanent injunction against Johann Steynberg, the CEO of the now-defunct bitcoin ponzi Mirror Trading International (MTI). According to a 
statement
 released by the U.S. derivatives regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on April 27, Steynberg is required to pay $1,733,838,372 in restitution to defrauded victims and a $1,733,838,372 civil monetary penalty.


The derivatives regulator's statement also revealed that the penalty handed down by the court 'is [the] highest civil monetary penalty ordered in any CFTC case.' The court action itself is reported to be the 'largest fraudulent scheme involving Bitcoin charged in any CFTC case.'


As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, Steynberg, who was based in South Africa at the time, had 
repeatedly
 faced allegations of operating a bitcoin Ponzi scheme before he 
fled
 to Brazil in December 2020. Shortly after his disappearance, liquidation proceedings against MTI were instituted by victims based in South Africa.


Almost a year after he disappeared, Steinberg was 
captured
 by Brazilian law enforcement and is awaiting his 
extradition
 to either the U.S. or his native home of South Africa.


Steynberg and MTI Failed to Comply With CPO Regulations


As per the CFTC statement, the U.S. court order outlines Steynberg's alleged fraudulent activities as well as his failure to comply with regulations.


'The order finds that Steynberg, the founder and CEO of Mirror Trading International Proprietary Limited (MTI), a company currently in liquidation in the Republic of South Africa, is liable for fraud in connection with retail foreign currency (forex) transactions, fraud by an associated person of a commodity pool operator (CPO), registration violations, and failure to comply with CPO regulations,' reads the CFTC statement.


Although MTI was primarily operating and targeting victims based in South Africa, the CFTC statement claimed that Steynberg and his company had accepted bitcoin from 'some 23,000 individuals in the U.S.' without being 'registered as a CPO as required.' The regulator also alleged that Steynberg and MTI had 'misappropriated all of the Bitcoin they accepted from pool participants.'


Meanwhile, the CFTC also acknowledged in the statement that the penalty handed down by the court may 'not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.'

Bitcoin Pricing Kernels (PKs) are estimated using a novel data set from Deribit, the leading Bitcoin options exchange. The PKs, as the ratio between risk-neutral and physical density, dynamically reflect the change in investor preferences. Thus, the PKs improve the understanding of investor expectations and risk premiums in a new asset class. Bootstrap-based confidence bands are estimated in order to validate the results. Investors are heterogeneous in their risk profiles and preferences with respect to volatility and investment horizon. The empirical PKs turn out to be U-shaped for short-dated instruments and W-shaped for long-dated instruments. We find that investors are willing to pay a substantial risk premium to insure themselves against short-term price movements. The risk premium is smaller for longer-dated instruments and their traders are risk averse. The shape of the empirical PKs reveals the existence of a time-varying risk premium. The similarity between the shape of empirical PKs for Bitcoin and other markets that represent aggregate wealth shows that Bitcoin is becoming an established asset class.

Bitcoin Well Inc.
 ('
Bitcoin Well
' or the '
Company
') (
TSXV:BTCW; OTCQB:BCNWF
), the non-custodial fintech business which future-proofs money by making bitcoin useful to everyday people, today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. The company also announced new Online Portal features, including the ability to pay credit cards, taxes and other household bills directly with bitcoin, as well as purchase gift cards from hundreds of popular retailers with bitcoin.
 
Key highlights
 
Gross profit of $1.1 million (Q1 2022 - $1 million) with a gross margin improvement to 9%. 
The increased gross margin is a result of a changing product mix, with more higher-margin ATM sales in Q1 2023 relative to prior periods. Bitcoin Well continued to see strong ATMs volumes throughout the quarter, with a company record number of ATM transactions in the month of March 2023.
 
Bitcoin Well recorded Adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.22 million (Q1 2022 - negative $1.5 million). 
Changes in the unrealized value of our cryptocurrency loans and digital assets may result in significant swings in net income which are not indicative of the underlying operational performance of the business. We present Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the variability caused by the revaluations and other items not expected to recur in normal operations.
 
Approximately 3,800 unique users in the Online Portal (Q4 2022 - 2,500) an improvement of 52%. 
Associated Online monthly revenues exceeded $369,000 (Q4 2022 - $190,000), maintaining continued growth in the product since launched in Q4 2022.
 
Canadians can now also buy gift cards and pay credit cards, taxes and household bills with bitcoin through the Online Portal at bitcoinwell.com/app

The Company's Q1 2023 revenue decreased to $12.4 million compared to $13.5 million in Q1 2022. Despite the decrease in revenue, gross profit increased to $1.1 million in Q1 2023, compared to $0.9 million in the same time period in the prior year, an improvement of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA improved to negative $0.2 million in Q1 2023 compared to negative $1.5 million in the prior year, an improvement of 71%.
 
Notably, the Company achieved a 9% Gross Margin in Q1 2023 compared to a 7% Gross Margin in Q1 2022, resulting from a relative increase in higher-margin ATM sales in the quarter.
 
'We have been working hard to maintain consistency across our existing cash flow generating business units, being ATMs and OTC (Bitcoin Well Infinite), despite the volatile crypto markets, all while still achieving strong growth in the Online Portal in terms of users and revenue. This is displayed in our Q1 2023 results, and we are staying committed to continuing this positive trend. We are also excited to see the impact of the planned expansion to the USA, 
announced March 28, 2023
, to our existing cash flowing units in the coming periods,' said Luke Thibodeau, CFO.
 
Product advancements
 
 
Bitcoin Well has successfully incorporated the ability for users in Canada, USA, India, the EU and other countries around the world to purchase gift cards to popular retailers including Amazon, Uber, Air Canada and more using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies into the Online Portal. This is done through a partnership where Bitcoin Well will receive a portion of the margin earned on each transaction.
 
'The ability to use bitcoin to buy gift cards is an important part of bitcoin usability. We are a long ways away from merchants accepting bitcoin natively, and this helps bridge the gap and make bitcoin more usable in the meantime,' said Adam O'Brien, CEO of the Company. 'This additional functionality cements us as a leader in giving people the convenience of modern banking (easy ways to use money) with the benefits of bitcoin (self custody).'
 
Also released this month, Canadian users at bitcoinwell.com/app can now pay their household bills, taxes and credit cards with bitcoin.
 
Effective immediately, any payee that accepts payment through the Canadian bill payment network can be paid with bitcoin through the Bitcoin Well Online Portal.
 
'The Bitcoin Well Online Portal has the most functionality in the country!' Adam O'Brien continued. 'With our bill payments and gift card functionality, bitcoin just got a whole lot more useful.'
 
Other updates
 
Lastly, on May 1, 2023, the Company agreed to amendments to the Convertible Debenture issued on February 23, 2022. Amendments include an adjustment to the conversion price, which is now $0.25 (from $0.30), an amended interest rate of Prime + 6.2% (formerly 10% per annum), and an amendment to the term of the loan, which now extends to five (5) years from the issue date (formerly three (3) years from the issue date). These amendments are subject to regulatory approval.

Produced 702 BTC in April 2023 and 2,896 BTC Year-To-Date

Reported Unrestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents of $123.5 Million, and Increased Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 11,568 BTC (c. $319.2 Million) as of April 30, 2023



FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., May 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin ('BTC') production and miner installation updates for April 2023.

Management Commentary

'In April, we increased our operational hash rate to 14.0 exahashes, achieving 61% of our 23 exahashes goal, and we increased our installed hash rate to 17.9 exahashes, reaching 78% of the same goal,' said Fred Thiel Marathon's chairman and CEO. 'We produced 702 bitcoin in April, which is a 134% increase year-over-year, but a decrease from the prior month due to upward adjustments in the network's difficulty rate and to a lesser extent, curtailment activity, April having one less day than March, and the impact of the ‘luck factor' (see reference). In addition to increasing our hash rate, we also witnessed our first domestic deployment of immersion mining come online in Jamestown, ND. This immersion deployment is representative of our broader strategy to utilize technological innovations to optimize the performance of our miners and improve the efficiency of our operations. With 17.9 of our targeted 23 exahashes already installed and our operational hash rate consistently increasing, we remain confident that we are on track to achieve our primary target of 23 exahashes near the middle of 2023. We look forward to continuing to establish Marathon as one of the largest and most energy efficient Bitcoin miners globally.'

Operational Highlights and Updates

Figure 1: Operational Highlights

In April, approximately 10,600 of Marathon's Bitcoin miners (c. 1.6 EH/s) were newly energized at Applied Digital's facilities in North Dakota. Approximately 10,400 S19 XPs (c. 1.5 EH/s) were newly energized in Ellendale, ND. The remaining units were energized at the Jamestown, ND, facility, where Marathon initiated its first-ever domestic deployment of immersion mining.

As a result, the Company's operating fleet increased to approximately 122,900 Bitcoin miners, theoretically capable of producing approximately 14.0 EH/s, according to the manufacturer's specifications, as of May 1, 2023.

Once all of Marathon's previously purchased miners are installed, approximately 66% of the Company's hash rate is expected to be generated by S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation of mining rigs.

Financial Highlights and Updates

Figure 3: Financial Highlights

As of May 1, Marathon holds a total of 11,568 BTC, all of which are unrestricted. The Company opted to sell 600 BTC during the month of April and intends to sell a portion of its bitcoin holdings in future periods to support monthly operations, manage its treasury, and for general corporate purposes. The Company ended the month with $123.5 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.

Investor Notice

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2022. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future. Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or Bitcoin hash rate may also materially affect the future performance of Marathon's production of bitcoin. Additionally, all discussions of financial metrics assume mining difficulty rates as of May 2023. See ""Forward-Looking Statements"" below.

Forward-Looking Statements

Statements made in this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as 'may,' 'will,' 'plan,' 'should,' 'expect,' 'anticipate,' 'estimate,' 'continue,' or comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties, many of which the Company cannot predict with accuracy and some of which the Company might not even anticipate and involve factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and are advised to consider the factors listed above together with the additional factors under the heading 'Risk Factors' in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, as may be supplemented or amended by the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events, new information or otherwise.

Definition of Luck

'The Luck of crypto mining is probabilistic in nature. Imagine that each miner is given a lottery ticket for a certain amount of hashing power they provide. For illustrative purposes imagine that you provide 1 EH/s of hashing power and the overall hashing power in the network was 100 EH/s then you would receive 1 of 100 total lottery tickets. The probability of you winning the lottery (finding the block reward) would be 1%. So for every 100 blocks found you should statistically find 1 of them.

'Now imagine that you found 2 out of the 100 blocks, this means that you found a block earlier than you statistically should. You are lucky! Now imagine you found 0 out of 100. This would make you unlucky. Over the long run, statistically you should find on average 1 out of 100 (1%) blocks, but there is short term variance.'

175,Robert Kiyosaki Says Regional Banks Are Being Wiped Out — Calls Fed 'Criminal' – Economics Bitcoin News,Kevin Helms,2023-05-01 00:00:33,date,https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/,bitcoin.com,"Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki says the Fed is wiping out regional banks by supporting only big banks, like JPMorgan Chase.","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki says the Fed is wiping out regional banks by supporting only big banks, like JPMorgan Chase. Stating that the Fed 'is criminal,' he warned that its actions 'will bring down' the United States.


Robert Kiyosaki Says the Fed Is Criminal


The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, warned in a series of tweets this week that the Fed is wiping out regional banks by supporting only the big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.


Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday: 'WTF. What The Fed? Why is Fed destroying regional banks across America? Regional banks are [the] heart and soul of [the] economy. Fed via the Repo Market [is] killing regional banks. Is this intentional? Is a depression intentional? WTF is Fed up to? Get $ out of regionals.'


The renowned author followed up with a tweet Thursday, stating that even online retail giant Amazon is affected by the Fed's actions. 'Without credit flowing, Amazon is cutting 18,000 jobs,' he stressed, adding:


The ripple effect from WTFed will bring down USA … WTFed wiping out regional banks.


In a separate tweet, Kiyosaki cautioned that by 
supporting only the big banks
, such as JPMorgan Chase, the Fed is wiping out regional banks. Calling the Fed's action 'Cruel,' Kiyosaki reiterated his previous statement that regional banks are the heart and soul of America. Calling the Fed 'criminal,' he then urged his 2.4 million Twitter followers to support small banks and small businesses.


 
On Friday, Kiyosaki warned in another tweet about President Joe Biden's central bank digital currency (CBDC) and went on to recommend his customary choices of investing in additional gold, silver, and bitcoin. He wrote:


In his book 1984, George Orwell warned ‘Big Brother is watching.' Biden's CBDC is ‘Big Brother.' Buy more gold, silver, and bitcoin.


In a recent episode of his Rich Dad Show, Kiyosaki discussed 
economic chaos
, war breaking out, and rising starvation. Earlier this month, he said, 'America is dying,' 
warning
 about hyperinflation and the death of the U.S. dollar.


Do you think the Fed is criminal like Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki said? Do you think regional banks are being wiped out? Let us know in the comments section below.

The billionaire added that their relations 'are getting so bad' that U.S.-China trade could collapse. He cautioned that the next 18 months 'will be a very risky period.'


U.S. and China on the Brink of War, Says Dalio


Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's largest asset manager, Bridgewater Associates, warned in a Linkedin post, published Wednesday, that the U.S. and China are on the brink of war. The billionaire, who has visited China for almost 40 years and has built close friendships there, shared his perspectives from his recent 13-day trips to China, as well as from meetings with Chinese citizens, experts on China residing outside the country, and policymakers in other countries, including the U.S.


Regarding U.S.-China relations, Dalio stressed:


The United States and China are on the brink of war and are beyond the ability to talk.


He noted that the two nations appear to be 'close to having a sanctions war and/or military war that neither side wants.'


Dalio clarified: 'I want to emphasize that by saying that they are on the brink, I don't mean to say that they will necessarily go over the brink. I mean to say that they are very close to crossing red lines that, if crossed, will irrevocably push them over the brink into some type of war that damages these two countries and causes damage to the world order in severe and irrevocable ways — like Russia's invasion of Ukraine did for Russia and the world, just much bigger.'


Next 18 Months ‘Very Risky' for China and U.S.


The Bridgewater Associates founder cautioned that the next 18 months will be very risky for China and the U.S. Noting that 'The hawkish political influences in the United States will exert more pressure on the relationship over the next 18 months because of the emergence of the 2024 election season,' Dalio opined:


That will be a very risky period because China and the U.S. are now already on the brink of war.


'The political timetable of the election cycle between now and the 2024 elections in the United States and Taiwan will likely lead to more push-the-limit anti-Chinese brinksmanship from the U.S.,' he continued.
 
The billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates added:


U.S.-China relations are getting so bad that there is reason to worry that anti-China sentiment could make doing business with China like doing business with Russia, which would lead U.S.-China trade to collapse.


'This would have similarly damaging economic consequences, though many times larger, severely hurting supply chains and trade. That would at a minimum cause severe economic consequences for the U.S., China, and the world and at a maximum could lead to military war,' he cautioned. 'These conflicts are affecting most countries' and multinational companies' relations and how the world is operating in innumerable ways that are intensifying.'


Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Defense revealed this week that it is focused on potential conflict with China. 'We have a clear strategy that's focused on China,' the deputy secretary of defense told Bloomberg. 'Our focus is making sure that the PRC [People's Republic of China] leadership wakes up every day and says, ‘Today is not the day to undertake aggression that threatens U.S. interests' … That's our focus today, in 2027, and in 2035 and 2045.'


What do you think about billionaire Ray Dalio's warning? Do you think the U.S. and China will go to war? Let us know in the comments section below.

 today announced that it has entered into a new two-year hosting agreement with Cantaloupe Digital LLC, a subsidiary of Canaan, Inc. ('Canaan').
 
Canaan Bitcoin Mining Agreement
 
On April 27, 2023, the Company signed a two-year hosting agreement with Cantaloupe Digital LLC, a subsidiary of Canaan, whereby Stronghold will operate 2,000 A1346 (110 TH/s per miner) and 2,000 A1246 (90 TH/s per miner) Bitcoin miners supplied by Canaan (the 'Canaan Miners'), with total hash rate capacity of 400 PH/s (the 'Canaan Bitcoin Mining Agreement').
 
The Canaan Bitcoin Mining Agreement has the following key terms:
 
Two-year term, with no unilateral early termination option.
Stronghold will receive 50% of the Bitcoin mined by the Canaan Miners and receive payments from Canaan equal to 55% of the net cost of power at the Company's Panther Creek plant, in dollar-per-megawatt-hour terms, calculated on a monthly basis.
Stronghold will retain all upside associated with selling power to the grid, and, if Stronghold elects to curtail the Canaan Miners to sell power to the grid, Canaan will receive a true-up payment that represent estimates of the Bitcoin mining revenue would have been generated had the miners not been curtailed.
The A1246 Bitcoin miners are to be installed by May 15, 2023, and the A1346 Bitcoin miners are to be installed by June 15, 2023. All 2,000 A1246 Bitcoin miners are currently on site and ready to be deployed.
 
'While we have emphasized our necessary deleveraging efforts over the last ten months, we think that the most meaningful measure of our work is the capital efficiency of our mining fleet today,' said Greg Beard, chairman and chief executive officer of Stronghold. 'Since August, we have received or procured approximately 22,000 incremental miners, with hash rate capacity of approximately 2.2 EH/s, while investing approximately $15 million of incremental capital, which is approximately $7 per TH/s. We achieved this through opportunistic purchases of Bitcoin miners in a distressed market and through unique hosting agreements where we retain exposure to Bitcoin mining economics and power upside, consistent with our vertically integrated business model.
 
'Our previously announced consensual return of approximately 19,000 delivered and approximately 26,000 total miners, with hash rate capacity of approximately 1.8 EH/s and 2.5 EH/s, respectively, to our lender in August, in exchange for the extinguishment of $67 million of debt, understandably caused investors to question our growth prospects. Our recent actions should help to alleviate those concerns. We shed approximately 2.5 EH/s of hash rate capacity—that cost approximately $90 million and was financed with approximately $67 million of debt—and nearly replaced that capacity with more efficient miners, amounting to hash rate capacity of 2.2 EH/s, with only $15 million of incremental capital. Replacing $90 million of miners with $15 million of miners, while ending up with similar hash rate, dramatically improves capital efficiency and return on equity, all else equal. This Canaan agreement will bring us to approximately 3.6 EH/s of delivered hash rate capacity and leaves us with only a few thousand unutilized miner slots at our wholly owned data centers left to fill.'
 
William Spence Retirement
 
As previously disclosed, on March 29, 2023, the Company's co-founder and former co-chairman, William 'Bill' Spence, announced his retirement and resignation from the Company's board. Bill will continue to work with the Company in a reduced capacity via a recently agreed to consulting arrangement focused primarily on supporting the Company's efforts related to reclamation, beneficial use ash, and carbon sequestration. Bill intends to spend his retirement with his family, including one grandchild and two more on the way.
 
'A native of Pennsylvania who grew up surrounded by the waste coal piles, Bill is a pioneer in the coal refuse-to-power and beneficial use ash markets and has spent decades trying to clean up one of the most environmentally neglected regions in the United States,' commented Mr. Beard. 'We are extremely grateful for Bill's vision, service, and leadership. We wish Bill all the best in his deserved retirement as he focuses on his family and health, but we are grateful that he will continue to work with Stronghold in areas that are passions for Bill and that represent significant opportunities for the Company.'

In this paper we predict Bitcoin movements by utilizing a machine-learning framework. We compile a dataset of 24 potential explanatory variables that are often employed in the finance literature. Using daily data from 2nd of December 2014 to July 8th 2019, we build forecasting models that utilize past Bitcoin values, other cryptocurrencies, exchange rates and other macroeconomic variables. Our empirical results suggest that the traditional logistic regression model outperforms the linear support vector machine and the random forest algorithm, reaching an accuracy of 66%. Moreover, based on the results, we provide evidence that points to the rejection of weak form efficiency in the Bitcoin market.


 










 


Does Bitcoin respond to financial, cryptocurrency, and macroeconomic shocks? Should Bitcoin follow the efficient market hypothesis? Do the other cryptocurrencies affect the volatility of Bitcoin prices? Bitcoin emerged in 2009 as the world's first cryptocurrency, attracting new investors due to high returns. This is reflected by the returns of Bitcoin, as quoted on Coinbase, increasing by more than 120% from 2016 to 2017, reaching USD20.000 from USD900 for the purchase of a single Bitcoin token. In early 2017, the market capitalization of Bitcoin grew significantly from around USD18 billion to nearly USD600 billion at the end of that year. As an investment asset, Bitcoin was originally in the retail sector but has now become the benchmark for all other digital currencies that have emerged, such as Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin, among others.
Prior research has compared Bitcoin to gold due to its low correlation with other financial assets [
1
]. In a similar vein to gold, Bitcoin can be used to hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty, using futures contracts (Bakkt) and unregulated cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, such as BitMex, Huobi and OKex [
2
,
3
]. The motivation behind this is that Bitcoin has a fixed supply, so it does not suffer from the devaluation problem of paper money that occurs through quantitative easing.
Although there are also some studies that focus on predicting stock market price movements, it is important to consider the cryptocurrency market, which, according to Ferreira et al. [
4
], is characterized by high volatility, no closed trading periods, relatively smaller capitalization, and high market data availability. However, in an efficient market [
5
], prices of securities in financial markets fully reflect all variable information. Given that the future is unknown, prices should follow a random walk; that is, future changes in stock (security) prices should, for all practical purposes, be unpredictable. In the weak-form efficiency case, future returns cannot be predicted based on past price changes. Therefore, in the long run, one cannot outperform the market by using publicly available information.
However, Bitcoin and other digital assets are not backed by any tangible assets. In general, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known to react to certain public market announcements [
6
,
7
]. In this regard, the cryptocurrencies market is highly efficient, with prices reflecting accessible real-world information almost instantly.
Various types of modeling methodologies have been applied in an attempt to forecast Bitcoin prices. Among the most prominent techniques are: random forest [
8
], artificial neural networks [
9
,
10
], bayesian neural networks [
11
], and deep learning chaotic neural networks [
12
]. However, irrational and unexpected factors such as sentiment have been favored more in empirical research on the Bitcoin market [
13
,
14
,
15
]. Kraaijeveld and de Smedt [
14
] study to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Nevertheless, some researchers have examined unexpected US monetary policy announcements, considering that these exercize a significant impact on Bitcoin [
16
], while others establish that there is a connection between cryptocurrencies and news, more broadly through macroeconomics news announcements. Corbet et al. [
16
] report that positive news after employment and durable good announcements results in a decrease in Bitcoin returns. However, an increase in the percentage of negative news surrounding these announcements is linked with an increase in Bitcoin returns.
Akyildirim et al. [
17
] focus on the prediction of cryptocurrency returns by collecting the twelve most liquid daily cryptocurrencies using machine-learning classification algorithms, including the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression models, artificial neutral networks, and random forest. They find an average classification accuracy close to 50% for all these techniques. Finally, they observe that the SVM gives superior and more consistent results compared to those of logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest classification algorithms. Jaquart et al. [
18
] also apply machine-learning techniques to predict high-frequency (one minute to 60 min) Bitcoin prices over the period 4 March 2019 to 10 December 2019. They discover that all tested models make statistically viable predictions, forecasting the binary market movement with accuracies ranging from 50.9% to 56.0%. Chen et al. [
19
] apply several machine-learning methods to forecast high-frequency (5-min intervals) Bitcoin prices. The authors collected daily data between 17 July 2017 and 17 January 2018. For daily forecasting, they observe that statistical methods and machine learning achieve 66% and 65% accuracy, respectively, which outperforms benchmark methods.
In our study, we attempt to uncover the potential relationship between cryptocurrencies and other financial variables using a machine-learning framework on weekly data. To accomplish this, we compile a pool of 24 potential regressors based on economic theory and prior research. Using three different techniques, an SVM model with a linear kernel and a random forest algorithm, we examine the directional forecasting performance of our models in comparison to the commonly used logistic regression model. The innovation of our work stems from the application of state-of-art machine-learning methodology and the empirical identification of a relationship between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and macroeconomic variables. We also specifically test the relationship between Bitcoin prices, exchange rates, and interest rates as a possible empirical validation of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) under a machine-learning framework.
The results of the empirical investigation provide evidence that the returns on Bitcoin are independent of returns on other cryptocurrencies or macroeconomic determinants. This reveals that Bitcoin is a special asset independent of monetary policy or other digital currencies. According to this, investors could be able to utilize Bitcoin as a hedge against regulatory frameworks affecting interest rates and inflation. Given its ability to act as a hedge and its resistance to quantitative easing due to its limited supply, Bitcoin has the potential to flourish and strongly influence alternative investments for several years to come.
The remainder of the paper is organized in the following way: In the next section, we describe the data. 
Section 3
 outlines the methodology that we use in our research. 
Section 4
 reports our empirical findings. 
Section 5
 summarizes and concludes.
We developed a binary classifier based on SVM to predict the stock price movements of Bitcoin. The data was collected daily from Coinlore.com, a website providing high-frequency cryptocurrency data. The macroeconomic variables and interest rates were obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), and the collection of selected exchange rates were acquired from Yahoo finance. The data spans from the 2nd of December 2014 to 8th July 2019. We compiled a dataset of 24 variables, which included the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index as a factor, given that an increase in the EPU will change investors' sentiments for the worse, according to Yen and Cheng [
20
] (Panel A). We included various exchange rates, such as EUR, GBP, JPY, and AUD, against the domestic country's USD exchange rate to check whether these currencies affect Bitcoin movements (Panel B). We also assembled the main interest rates that were used as benchmarks for the US and the European economy (Panel C). Moreover, following the literature review that attributes Bitcoin's movements, we considered that other cryptocurrencies [
21
] could influence Bitcoin's volatility (Panel D). Finally, in Panel E, we created three different variables: the momentum for each 5, 10 and 15 days from the start of the dataset, giving more information to the model.
Overall, more than 700 observations were collected, but because the stock exchange is closed on weekends and there were many missing values, we applied a filtering process to the data. After we filtered the data, the final sample consisted of 239 observations. Financial returns (

 were calculated with P denoting the closing prices of each variable in our sample. All the variables in our data, along with summary statistics, are displayed in 
Table 1
. The JPY/USD exchange rate and the cryptocurrency Deutsche eMark (DEM), with values of 0.000436 and 0.000019 respectively, appear to have the smallest positive standard deviations that are close to zero. This indicates that these two factors have the lowest volatility. For the target (output), we modeled the return of Bitcoin, using a binary-dependent variable coded as 0 or 1, where 0 indicates that the return of the Bitcoin value is negative (the value decreased from the previous day) and the 1 indicates that the return of the BTC is positive (the value increased from the previous day).
Undertaking directional forecasting requires that the dependent variable be binary and take two states: 0 or 1, expressing the next negative and positive Bitcoin return values, respectively. The basic drawback of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methodology is that the nature of the dependent variable makes OLS regression results irrelevant due to the heteroskedasticity of the estimated errors and the hypothesis violations in the asymptotic efficiency of the estimated coefficients. To solve this issue, we estimated the probability

 that the dependent variable is equal to 1. Given the conversion of the dependent variable to binary, the logarithm of the probability of being in state 1 to state 0 is obtained from the following equation, which is called the 'logit,' where

If the estimated

Data classification and regression tasks usually include the use of the SVM, a supervised machine-learning methodology. It has gained great popularity due to its ability to provide highly accurate prediction results without making a priori assumptions concerning the phenomenon under investigation. Finding the ideal hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the two classes and the highest level of accuracy enables the SVM to classify the data into two classes [
22
]. A tiny minority of data points known as support vectors (SV) that were found using a minimization technique define the hyperplane. This process is shown visually in 
Figure 1
. In our study, the initial dataset is split into two subsamples: the training set and the testing set. The training step, when the hyperplane is established, receives 80% of the data. The remaining 20% of the total sample is used in the testing set, where the generalization ability of the model is tested on the small part of the dataset that was set aside during the training set.
The hyperplane is defined as:
where V = {i:0 < 








y






i








 < C} is the set of support vector indices.
The SVM with a linear kernel has become widespread, given that it possesses faster training and classification speeds with significantly fewer memory requirements than nonlinear cores due to the SBM's compact representation of the decision function. In our research, we also examine the linear kernel where it detects the separating hyperplane in the original dimensional space of the dataset. The mathematical representation of the Radian Basis Function (RBF) kernel is the following:
Over-fitting is a common issue that appears in the training set, where the model 'learns' to accurately describe the training data, while giving worse performance to the test set. This concern is described in the literature as the 'low bias–high variance' [
23
,
24
]. To avoid over-fitting, we use a cross-validation framework, displayed in 
Figure 2
. The initial training set is split into n equal-sized parts. The training step is performed n times, using a different sample for testing, and the rest of the model is repeated in n − 1 parts, each time holding one part for test purposes. This process is reiterated n times with the same set of parameters until all parts of the test process have passed, evaluating the average accuracy of the model performance for that set of hyperparameters in all n parts of the test. Based on our study, we use a 5-fold cross-validation procedure 5 times, applying and evaluating its accuracy on the sample of 20% of the data.
Random forest is an ensemble technique that combines the idea of decision trees with the bootstrapping and aggregating procedure to create a diversified pool of individual regression systems [
25
]. The random forest algorithm is referred to in the literature by many researchers as a method commonly used to avoid overfitting issues that may arise in decision trees by combining multiple decision trees into a setup called random forest [
26
,
27
]. Each tree is constructed from a random set of features where there is a replacement subsample of size n, the same as in the initial dataset. The observations that were not selected in the bootstrapping process form the out-of-bag (OOB) set used for the testing generalization ability of the trained model. To reduce the dependence of the models on the training set, each tree uses a randomly selected subset of the explanatory variables (features). Normally, we use the square root of the total number of features. The system aggregates the classification of each tree and retains the most popular class.
Our study uses four separate performance indicators to illustrate how effectively the machine-learning categorization models execute detailed forecasting. The confusion matrix is created as shown in 
Table 2
, where the predictive scores are binary and just one single confusion matrix can analyze it. Each category of the confusion matrix (TN, FN, FP, TP) is evaluated separately. Specifically, the TN expresses the number of predictions that were correctly classified in the negative category, while the FP implies the number of predictions that were incorrectly classified in the positive category. Also, the FN expresses the number of predictions that were incorrectly classified in the negative category, while the TP declares the number of predict",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Andros Gregoriou,Athanasia Dimitriadou,Dimitriadou,Gregoriou",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/entropy/entropy-25-00777/article_deploy/html/images/entropy-25-00777-g001-550.jpg?1683704210,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,8.622828,d19528f34487dfe686bccb1bc981de7a

All Eyes on Ether as Bitcoin Pushes Down?
Good Morning Asia,
Crypto is starting the trading day in Asia fairly flat after a promising U.S. Consumer Price Index pushed bitcoin above $28,000.
Bitcoin is now trading at $27,618, according to CoinDesk market data, which makes it effectively flat. Ether is down 0.4% to $1,838.
Katie Stockton, Founder and Managing Partner of Fairlead Strategies, said during a recent appearance on  that overall the crypto market likes the lower CPI numbers but don't expect price appreciation yet.
'From a technical perspective, the market does seem to like it, we're seeing a positive reaction. But really, the action is somewhat insignificant in terms of where both bitcoin and Ether have traded up late,' she said. 'They recently broke down below their 50-day moving averages.""
Stockton expects Bitcoin to pull back to its base breakout point of about $25,200. However, she still sees an upward trend in the intermediate term.
This lower price point should serve as a nice entry point for new investors, she argues.
Stockton also sees a short-term setback for Ether as it too, has moved out its 50-day moving average. However, she predicts Ether might outperform bitcoin in the short term.
""We anticipate a downside for Ether, regardless of today's activity, with a support level around $1,755,' she said. 'This could provide a natural point for stabilization as oversold conditions may yield a rebound.""

Bitcoin has yet to find a new foundation that drives the price from its weeks-long range roughly between $25,000 and $30,000, Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, said on 's 'All About Bitcoin' program.
'Bitcoin is trying to find its next narrative,' Xu said.
Bitcoin's price seesawing on Wednesday encapsulated its vulnerability to events in recent weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose on a mildly favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) that showed inflation rising a less-than-expected 4.9% in April. But BTC sank around midday on internet rumors of a $320 million U.S. government bitcoin sell-off before rebounding as markets shrugged off the hearsay.
Xu noted that the price run-ups tied to a mini-run of U.S. bank failures in April and earlier this month had failed to spur long-lasting price momentum.
'We saw a bunch of banks get destroyed, and there's this narrative building that bitcoin will be a new banking system,' he said. 'Unfortunately, that narrative is still not fully substantiated.Bitcoin is oscillating during the existing market cycles, and we haven't reached that bullish momentum cycle yet.
He added: That is likely to happen next year. For the rest of this year, we're gonna see some more price oscillation.'
Xu believes that the steady decline in inflation from a peak of 9.1% last June will allow the U.S. central bank to reconsider the steady diet of hawkish interest rate increases that Federal Reserve critics blame for the near banking meltdown and other economic ills. 'There's a likelihood that we're going to see some potential cuts,' Xu said, adding that some analysts foresee interest rate cuts totaling 75 basis points (bps) in the months ahead.
'They need to take a long hard look at what all these interest rates hikes have been doing, and just the possibility of a deeper recession into the near future,' he said.
Xu said that liquidity would be important for crypto markets to thrive. Market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto recently abandoned crypto trading in the U.S. and other firms focused or with at least a deep interest in crypto have also been scaling back their activities or threatening to move them overseas.
But Xu said that 'these markets will find a way to exist, if not within U.S. borders,' and added that 'there will be institutional liquidity that comes in.'
'It's just building the right narrative. The next narrative needs to be a major innovation, like the Shanghai Shapella upgrade, or some sort of new L-2 (layer 2), or some major improvement to the bitcoin blockchain. And when we see those, we'll see more liquidity and action coming (into markets).'

Here's what's happening:
Prices: 
Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton anticipates a pullback to around $25,200 for bitcoin and a short-term setback for Ether, but sees potential for Ether to outperform Bitcoin in the short term.
Insights: 
Bitcoin needs a good story before it can push higher, says Brent Xu, CEO of  bond-market platform Umee. What will that narrative be?
 
All Eyes on Ether as Bitcoin Pushes Down?
Crypto is starting the trading day in Asia fairly flat after a 
promising U.S. Consumer Price Index 
 pushed bitcoin above $28,000.
Bitcoin is now trading at $27,618, according to CoinDesk market data, which makes it effectively flat. Ether is down 0.4% to $1,838.
Katie Stockton, Founder and Managing Partner of Fairlead Strategies, said during a recent appearance on  that overall the crypto market likes the lower CPI numbers but don't expect price appreciation yet.
'From a technical perspective, the market does seem to like it, we're seeing a positive reaction. But really, the action is somewhat insignificant in terms of where both bitcoin and Ether have traded up late,' she said. 'They recently broke down below their 50-day moving averages.""
Stockton expects Bitcoin to pull back to its base breakout point of about $25,200. However, she still sees an upward trend in the intermediate term.
This lower price point should serve as a nice entry point for new investors, she argues.
Stockton also sees a short-term setback for Ether as it too, has moved out its 50-day moving average. However, she predicts Ether might outperform bitcoin in the short term.
""We anticipate a downside for Ether, regardless of today's activity, with a support level around $1,755,' she said. 'This could provide a natural point for stabilization as oversold conditions may yield a rebound.""

183,Governor Ron DeSantis Signs Bill Prohibiting Use of Central Bank Digital Currencies in Florida – Bitcoin News,Jamie Redman,2023-05-13 00:00:49,date,https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/,bitcoin.com,"'They're going to be able to have the window into what you're doing with the money,' DeSantis said in Fort Myers.","On Friday Florida's governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation that bans the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the state. Following the bill SB 7054 being signed into law, Florida's Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) now explicitly forbids the use of a federally adopted CBDC as money.


Florida Puts the Brakes on CBDCs


The Sunshine State has officially outlawed the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) following the 
approval
 of SB 7054 or HB 7049 by the Florida House of Representatives and Senate. Governor Ron DeSantis put pen to paper and 
signed the bill
, cementing the ban on Friday. The signing ceremony, which took place in Fort Myers, was attended by Wilton Simpson, the state's 13th commissioner of agriculture, and Kathleen Passidomo, president of the Southwest Florida Public Service Academy at Fort Myers Technical College.


The new anti-CBDC law will come into effect on July 1, 2023. 'They're going to be able to have the window into what you're doing with the money and the ability to control where that money is going,' DeSantis 
said
 during the signing ceremony. 'They could block, if you filled up your gas tank too much, hey, they're fighting global warming, ‘You can't do any more.' Maybe you bought a firearm last week. They don't want you to buy another one this week.'


Several GOP lawmakers, including 
Tom Emmer
 and 
Ted Cruz
, have introduced bills opposing the use of CBDCs. Governor DeSantis is urging other politicians and states to follow Florida's example and take a stand against CBDCs. However, not everyone is on board with this decision. Nobel laureate and Keynesian economist Paul Krugman 
criticized
 DeSantis, stating that it's 'highly unlikely that a state government would have the right to prohibit' the use of a CBDC.


While some Republican state leaders are opposed to CBDCs, others are more welcoming. Surprisingly, Democratic senator 
Elizabeth Warren
 of Massachusetts, who is known for her strong stance against corruption in the banking industry, is in favor of CBDCs. In a recent interview with NBC's Chuck Todd, Warren expressed her support for CBDCs, 
stating
 that 'it's time for us to move in that direction.'
 
Governor DeSantis, on the other hand, remains resolute in his belief that CBDCs pose a threat to Florida's financial stability and is determined to lead the charge against them. 'I'm just glad we are thinking ahead here in the state of Florida because once this genie is out of the bottle, I think it will be very hard to put back in,' DeSantis 
said
 in Fort Myers. There is a widespread belief that DeSantis has his sights set on the White House and will be running for president of the United States in the 2024 election.

: Some high profile Twitter users landed in a soup. Hackers gained control of accounts belonging to famous people and big companies like Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Apple. Twitter said it was a ""coordinated social engineering attack"" where hackers tricked Twitter employees to access ""internal systems and tools."" Twitter confirmed that they were looking into what other things the hackers did and what information they accessed, in addition to sending tweets from the compromised accounts, as per the Guardian.
Twitter stopped all verified accounts from tweeting at all, an unprecedented move to halt the hack. Twitter restored most accounts by Wednesday evening but warned that they ""may take further actions."" The company locked the compromised accounts and limited access to internal systems and tools while they continue their investigation.
As per the report, the hacker identified as Joseph James O'Connor admitted he did something wrong in a New York court. He had been brought to the court from Spain on April 26. Almost two years ago, he was caught in Spain for breaking into more than 130 Twitter accounts in July 2020. Some of the accounts belonged to famous people like Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Elon Musk who now owns Twitter.
The hacker and others in his group sent tweets proposing a classic bitcoin scam. They told followers that if they transferred cryptocurrency to a specific bitcoin wallet, they would receive double the money in return. 
'O'Connor's criminal activities were flagrant and malicious, and his conduct impacted multiple people's lives. He harassed, threatened, and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm,' said Kenneth A Polite Jr, an assistant attorney general in the US justice department's criminal division told the publication.'Like many criminal actors, O'Connor tried to stay anonymous by using a computer to hide behind stealth accounts and aliases from outside the United States.'
It's not the first time Twitter has faced an insider threat. In 2017, a customer support employee briefly deleted Donald Trump's account. And in 2019, two former employees were charged with spying after they allegedly accessed thousands of users' account information and provided it to the government of Saudi Arabia.

Bitcoin has been embraced by many individuals with strong right-leaning views on freedom, property rights, and self-sovereignty. Among left-leaning progressives, Bitcoin is often quickly dismissed as irrelevant or a major source of carbon emissions. Bitcoin seems, however, to be full of surprises. A rapidly advancing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that its adoption may affect causes important to progressives, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating electrification of economies, alleviating poverty, and supporting human rights for people living under political repression, even though scientific confirmation is lagging. In this paper, I highlight how a Pragmatist perspective can be applied to Bitcoin, a technological and financial innovation that may well reshape how humans perceive and use money, preserve wealth, and structure governance. I first cover Bitcoin's technological and financial fundamentals and some core concepts of Pragmatism, before outlining how Bitcoin might surprise progressives. Pragmatism offers a philosophical and political grounding for left-leaning 'progressive Bitcoiners' who prioritize environmental and social well-being and view inclusive deliberative democracy as the preferred form of governance.


 










 


Bitcoin, a groundbreaking technological and financial innovation, is full of surprises. It is at the center of a complex, multifaceted discourse; among left-leaning 'progressives', Bitcoin has a notorious reputation for high energy consumption and carbon emissions. Advocates, on the other hand, posit that it holds transformative potential across economic, social, and environmental domains [
1
]. Bitcoin appears to have the ability to help mitigate methane emissions, accelerate electrification of the economy, alleviate poverty, and bolster human rights. Such claims, however, are largely based on only a burgeoning body of anecdotal evidence, not on settled scientific evidence.
In this era of accelerating technological advance, it is imperative to explore potential intersections of differing ideological perspectives. Surprisingly, left-leaning progressives and right-leaning libertarians might find common ground in the multifaceted impacts of Bitcoin. With its counterintuitive potential to help reshape economies, improve environmental outcomes, and help protect human rights, Bitcoin may offer a rare opportunity for individuals with diverse political viewpoints to recognize shared interests, foster a balanced discourse, and drive collaborative in efforts to control climate change and improve the lives of people living in poverty or under political repression.
One surprise often triggers more surprises, prompting individuals to critically evaluate their current understanding of the world. When new, justified beliefs emerge, they may catalyze a further cascade of behavioral, technological, and institutional innovations. As individuals and societies familiarize themselves with previously unforeseen possibilities, their aspirations for the future adapt to the newly identified opportunities and potential threats. This dynamic cycle of surprise, inquiry, innovation, and evolving aspirations underpins Pragmatism, a philosophy with its roots embedded in the work of late 19th and early 20th century American philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Pragmatism does not simply mean being 'practical', nor is it the opposite of 'idealism'. Pragmatism is a philosophy that emphasizes the core role of experience in creating knowledge, producing belief, and spurring action.
My focus in this paper is to highlight how a Pragmatist perspective can be applied to Bitcoin, a technological and financial innovation that may well reshape how humans perceive and use money, preserve wealth, and structure governance. I start with a review of Bitcoin's technological and financial fundamentals, including how energy-intensive computing is used to produce bitcoin (throughout the paper I refer to capital B Bitcoin, the protocol, and lowercase b bitcoin, the currency).
The second section of the paper then outlines some core concepts of Pragmatism before, in the third section, reviewing three of Bitcoin's potentially surprising impacts: (1) Bitcoin may, despite its high level of energy consumption, be an important climate change mitigation tool, helping to reduce net global greenhouse gas emissions arising from methane venting and flaring; (2) Bitcoin production may increase the financial viability of new renewable energy infrastructure, helping to accelerate electrification of the economy; and (3) Bitcoin may help alleviate poverty and enhance human rights, empowering vulnerable individuals, households, and organizations facing government repression.
In the final section, I examine Bitcoin's potential implications for governance. Bitcoin has frequently been adopted by right-leaning individuals who often identify with conservative or libertarian politics. Pragmatism, however, offers a philosophical and political grounding for left-leaning 'progressive Bitcoiners' who prioritize environmental and social well-being and view inclusive deliberative democracy as the preferred form of governance. This implies an imperative for intelligent inquiry, forgoing superficial narratives based on caricatures of peoples' lived experience, because of the potential opportunity costs to society of getting policy decisions regarding Bitcoin wrong.
Drawing on a number of prior independent computing and cryptographic innovations [
2
], the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto [
3
] created the Bitcoin protocol, which became operational in January 2009. After successfully implementing the protocol, Nakamoto stopped posting online in December 2010 and disappeared, leaving Bitcoin to operate ever since without a leader, marketing efforts, or centralized control. Public–private key cryptography is used to store and spend money (bitcoin) and block transactions are cryptographically validated by tens of thousands of node operators to ensure decentralized security. Bitcoin code allows people to interact financially via a secure global peer-to-peer network, without divulging their identity and having to trust third-party intermediaries.
The Bitcoin network consists of bitcoin producers ('miners') who produce the blocks of financial transactions that comprise Bitcoin's distributed ledger and node operators (>40,000 individuals from around the globe who validate transactions and maintain full copies of the Bitcoin ledger). The term blockchain is often used to describe the ledger but because the ordering of transactions over time is a primary protocol function, the term timechain [
3
] may be an apt descriptor (
https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/
, accessed on 17 May 2023). Additionally, core developers refine and add new features to the Bitcoin code (
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/
, accessed on 17 May 2023), and Layer 2 developers build applications that use Bitcoin as a base layer.
Bitcoin miners from around the globe compete to be the first to solve a cryptographic challenge, which gives one miner the right to create the next block and receive bitcoin rewards from the protocol. Combinations of industrial- and small-scale miners often band together in mining pools (not shown in the chart) that share rewards proportionally according to their computing effort. Besides a reward for block creation, the successful miner also receives any transaction fees paid by users whose transactions were contained within the block. The miners can either hold their bitcoin, speculating that it will increase in value over time, or they can sell it, generating revenue to cover their costs and profit.
The difficulty of solving the cryptographic challenge is adjusted every two weeks so that as computing power on the network fluctuates, blocks are still mined approximately every 10 min. There is a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin that are released on a declining supply schedule; the level of available bitcoin rewards per block halves about every four years, with the last bitcoin being issued in about 2140. All bitcoin traded in spot markets came from a miner at some time in the past.
Bitcoin node operators run a distributed global network of computers that each store the full Bitcoin ledger. These computers, which can be very simple, consume minimal energy and are used to verify each Bitcoin block mined.
Lighting Network and other emerging Layer 2 applications can record small transactions off chain and settle on chain only periodically. Each block mined now contains in the range of 2000 financial transactions (
https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transactions_per_block
, accessed on 17 May 2023). With scaling solutions, there is no way to know how many transactions are included in a block (Lightning is like a tab that can be kept open, potentially for long periods, and settled in a single transaction when the tab is closed); a single Bitcoin block could, in time, contain millions of transactions once Lightning is widely adopted.
With Lightning Network, bitcoin transactions can be settled virtually instantaneously anywhere on the globe and essentially for free, allowing Bitcoin to compete directly with existing 'payment rails' in the traditional financial sector [
4
] and serve as a platform for micropayment-based local economies.
Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to provide network security. The Bitcoin mining network currently calculates >300 exahash (3.0 × 10
20
 calculations) per second (
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html#3y
, accessed on 17 May 2023), accounting for approximately 0.22% of global energy production and 0.64% of global electricity use (
https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/comparisons
, accessed on 17 May 2023). Cheating—falsifying a transaction in Bitcoin's globally distributed ledger—would involve altering all previously linked transactions leading up to a targeted transaction. Essentially what Bitcoin does is embed physical power (electricity) into digital form, making the ledger immutable because of the prohibitive costs—physical and financial—required to manipulate it.
Bitcoin miners can use electricity from any energy source (e.g., fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, hydroelectric, etc.) to power their computers (the 'mining rigs'). Electricity costs dominate the cost of production, so access to cheap electricity is essential to the long-term success of any mining enterprise. Bitcoin mining operations can be set up behind the meter, prior to electricity from generating facilities being sold into the electricity grid, or after the meter, in which case miners are a customer who pays wholesale or retail prices to a utility company for their electricity. A recent industry analysis suggests that >50% of current bitcoin mining power comes from renewable energy sources (
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy

Note that carbon emissions come almost exclusively from energy production used to create electricity, not directly from the transformation of electricity into bitcoin. Bitcoin's carbon emissions profile thus depends on if and how Bitcoin mining affects energy use patterns in the presence or absence of bitcoin mining. Similarly, if mining is powered with fossil fuels (e.g., coal) that cause environmental damage or impact human health in the locale where the fuel was extracted, attribution of damages depends on how the level of damage varies in the presence or absence of Bitcoin mining.
Firms generating electricity from a variety of energy sources can use battery technologies to store electricity for short periods, allowing producers to time the market and increase the value of the electricity when it is sold to a grid operator. Behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining facilities can, however, act as 24 h per day customers, buying electricity that would otherwise be curtailed (blocked from entering the grid) during periods of low customer demand or wasted (e.g., nighttime wind energy, hydropower during wet season, etc.).
Bitcoin mining adds flexibility to production strategies for energy firms selling electricity to the grid and increases their revenue stream. As a result of mining having no storage constraints—bitcoin can be sold in the international market 24 h per day, 365 days per year—behind-the-meter Bitcoin miners provide flexibility to electricity producers beyond that which short-term battery storage can offer. Improving the financial performance of renewable energy producers allows them to accelerate and expand their electricity generation facilities. Mining is extremely competitive and there is, and will be, a constant push to use cheap waste and stranded energy that nobody else can monetize.

186,What Is a Bitcoin Worth?,Madeline Hume,2023-05-15 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1157995/what-is-a-bitcoin-worth,morningstar.com,"This article, first of a series, attempts to answer that question by valuing bitcoin under the total addressable market approach.","Those who are declaring crypto is dead might want to check the charts. Bitcoin has appreciated by more than 75% so far this year, climbing from a level of $16,540 as of Jan. 1 to $29,218 as of April 30. Over that period, it's beaten the Morningstar US Equity Index by a whopping 69 percentage points.
 
 
 
There are a few possible reasons for this. Bitcoin underwent a software upgrade late last year that opens its blockchain up to other use cases besides payments, which might have stirred up some interest. As the financial ecosystem around crypto has crumbled, it's possible that the faithful have returned to their mother ship and stashed their assets where they know they won't be touched. Gold has also rallied over that same stretch, leading some analysts to conclude that investors more broadly are looking for alternative stores of value as trust in financial institutions has ebbed after the regional bank failures that peppered the first few months of 2023.
 
Any of these reasons might be compelling, but only because other potential bitcoin investors find them meaningful. Right now, bitcoin is still a bit of a mirror: People will see what they want to see. Returns of 50% are possible because there are very few contrarians in crypto.
 
Unfortunately, this is equally as true on the way down as it is on the way up. Bitcoin will continue to cycle through boom after bust so long as there's no good way to value it. Only with cold hard numbers in hand can investors start to probe at the narratives that dominate crypto.
 
This article represents Morningstar's first attempt to do so. We will cover four common valuation exercises and evaluate the suitability of each as it relates to bitcoin.
 
4 Methods for Modeling
 
There are four popular models for proxying the value of bitcoin that hail from traditional stock valuation.
 
Two measure demand:
 
Total Addressable Market
Network Effects
 
Two measure supply:
 
Cost of Production
Stock-to-Flow
 
We will examine the other three models in future pieces; the balance of this article will focus on total addressable market.
 
Investors using the total addressable market method take an existing product or industry and estimate the size of that market. From there, they will estimate how much market share a new product could capture, giving them a rough idea of how much it could be worth to consumers.
 
Investors might recognize this approach from firms 
touting
 that bitcoin could someday displace gold as a store of value. Why all the focus on gold? Primarily it is because, like bitcoin, gold has a theoretical fixed supply. 
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and miners have already minted roughly 19 million as of May 2023
; 
roughly 209,000 tons of gold have ever been mined, leaving approximately 52,000 tons in the ground as of February 2023
.
 
There are 
practical
 reasons to discount this argument, which we have made before. But the narrative persists, with some analysts tempering their assumptions to reach more-reasonable valuations. Even if bitcoin captures just 10% of the market for gold, the thinking goes, it could reach prices as high as 
$154,000
.
 
For now, let's put aside the theory and focus on the math. One problem with that back-of-the-napkin estimate is that gold has another major application that gives it value and scarcity: jewelry. The World Gold Council estimates that jewelers have claimed about 
half
 of the world's aboveground supply of gold.
 
As an intangible asset, bitcoin cannot compete with gold on that front. So what we've done is scrape that stock from our estimate of the available supply to focus exclusively on financial use-cases. (We assume that no consumers are purchasing gold jewelry to use it as a store of value. We also assume that all nonjewelry storage can be classified as an investment. Both of these assumptions are likely not 100% true, but such are the risks of simple models.)
 
After adjusting for jewelry, our math suggests that bitcoin has attained much greater penetration of the 'store of value' market than other studies claim. At year-end 2022, bitcoin had a market capitalization of around $318 billion. The world's financial holdings of gold totaled about $6,528 billion, which means that bitcoin soaked up 4.9% of gold's market share as a store of value in 2022. Interestingly, bitcoin already passed the forecast 10% threshold back in 2021.
 
 
 
From here, an analyst would typically pick a terminal market share and multiply that by the size of the industry to forecast how much a product can grow.
 
 
 
So, how much bigger could bitcoin get? The unvarnished truth is that no one knows. If we ask Cathie Wood, bitcoin could eclipse 100% of gold's market cap. If bitcoin recouped its losses and nabbed back 10% of gold's market share, that would imply a price of $33,910. But market share could also fall back down to less than 2%, where bitcoin has floundered for most of the 2010s, if retail interest continues to dwindle after the slew of crypto blowups of 2022.
 
Rather than relying on guesswork, we will try to apply some rigor to the forecast by using history as a guide. The S-Curve was created by a rural sociologist named Everett Rogers in the 1960s to explain how innovation spreads. It has since become a cornerstone for modeling the rate of adoption for new technologies in a wide range of disciplines, from cancer prevention techniques to social networks.
 
The S-Curve models adoption along several distinct phases. Each phase is denoted by the audience it represents: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Rogers starts with a normal distribution of the entire market, segmenting it across each one of these categories. To build an S-Curve, the populations accumulate, so that the market share of a particular product equals some percentage of the audience it is currently expanding to, plus all of the groups that came before it.
 
 
 
By this metric, with a 4.9% market share, bitcoin is still in the throes of the early adopter phase. If it crossed over into the early majority phase, it would reach a price of $50,870. If it was to reach the late majority phase, it could surpass $169,000.
 
 
 
Given how simple they are, there are inherent flaws to relying on S-Curves for financial securities.
 
S-Curves assume that adoption is cumulative. Put another way, this would imply that users who adopted the technology in an earlier phase do not abandon it. We know from experience that that's not true: Bitcoin's market share declined to 4.9% from 13.7% in just a year.
Users are the unit of measurement for S-Curves, and the model assumes that the relationship between additional users and additional market share is 1:1. This relationship is intuitive for products. If you purchase a PC from Dell, for example, Dell's revenues will usually increase by the price of that computer. For financial assets, this assumption is a bit more of a reach. It implies that every additional bitcoin wallet opened pushes up bitcoin's price by a constant amount—a highly improbable condition.
 
Even once we plug in a forecast market share, using the total addressable market model to derive a price introduces additional wrinkles.
 
We assume that the suggested total addressable market, measured by gold's nonjewelry market capitalization, stays fixed over time.
We also assume that bitcoin's current circulating supply would also be its future circulating supply.
 
These two assumptions are clearly oversimplifications. We know that this is not how these assets work in practice: Gold's market capitalization grew by 3.7% annualized over the past 12 years, and bitcoin's circulating supply increases every day as miners approve new blocks.
 
While these assumptions may not be true, they can still be useful. That's because they point to something important about the design of a total addressable market model: Although there are certainly tweaks that investors can make, it's not inherently a time-varied approach. There is no end date unless the analyst defines one. That's a problem because it's not particularly informative to try to ascribe a future value to an asset when that future remains undefined.
 
Like all models, it's also at risk of misspecification. There may be critical tweaks that we missed that could hugely alter bitcoin's prospects. But by narrowing the scope from all gold to all gold ex-jewelry, we managed to cut the potential price appreciation of bitcoin in half—a pretty dramatic swing for a forecast.
 
These flaws demonstrate that there's still a long way to go before the total addressable market model contributes anything of value to valuation. After all, as Chicagoans know all too well, it's hard to set much stock in a sports forecaster who tells you the Cubs will win 
eventually

Crude oil, Bitcoin, and carbon dioxide emissions are major issues that are significantly impacting the global economy and environment. These three issues are complexly interlinked, with profound economic and environmental implications. In this study, we explore the correlation among these three issues and attempt to understand the influence of crude oil and Bitcoin on carbon dioxide emissions. We created a novel approach, named quantile mediation analysis, which blends mediation regression with quantile regression, enabling us to explore the influence of Brent crude oil on carbon dioxide emissions by considering the mediating impact of Bitcoin. According to the findings from using our new approach, the impact of Brent crude oil on carbon dioxide emissions is partly mediated by Bitcoin, and the association between Brent crude oil and carbon dioxide emissions involves both direct and indirect effects. Since the carbon dioxide generated by the extraction of crude oil and Bitcoin has a great impact on the environment, accelerating the use of clean energy technologies to reduce our reliance on crude oil should be the direction that the cryptocurrency industry ought to pursue in the future.


 










 


In recent years, with the sustained growth of the global economy, energy consumption has risen sharply. This phenomenon has led to exacerbated global air pollution, severe ecological damage, and an increasing threat to global sustainable development. For example, the rising demand for energy has resulted in the burning of large amounts of fossil fuels, which releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, accelerates the pace of climate change, and has a serious impact on the ecological environment, such as by causing increased extreme weather events and declining biodiversity. Therefore, it is necessary to propose solutions to address this issue in order to achieve global sustainable development goals. Governments have become increasingly concerned about the problem of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) enacted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 as the first global agreement aimed at comprehensively controlling greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account CO
2
 emissions. Subsequently, the global community established a series of international conventions, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Convention, in an effort to mitigate the disasters stemming from global warming.
Crude oil ranks among the primary energy sources on the global scale and its price movements have a significant impact on the global economy. It is an essential product for industrial production and a crucial raw material for gasoline, diesel, and lubricating oil used in transportation. Many daily necessities rely on the extraction and manufacture of crude oil because crude oil is connected to human economic conditions and the day-to-day lives of citizens countries around the world pay close attention to the economic impacts caused by oil crises and political factors [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
]. Due to the inseparable relationship between crude oil and the economy, many countries highly rely on it, resulting in increased CO
2
 emissions and making it a major contributor to global warming. In 2016, BP published a report on countries that are highly dependent on crude oil, ranking them in the following order: the United States, China, India, Japan, and Saudi Arabia [
6
]. Renewable energy is an alternative to reliance on crude oil, e.g., electric vehicles.
It is widely agreed that petroleum consumption is one of the major causes of CO
2
 emissions. The effects include land and ocean pollution caused by accidental leaks and pipeline ruptures, as well as upstream industry activities such as oil well drilling, production, transportation, and storage, and downstream activities such as refining, transportation, and sales [
7
,
8
]. In addition, the indiscriminate disposal of waste products from crude oil refining can also pollute the environment. The continued burning of fossil fuels has already caused the release of over 75% of CO
2
 emissions into the aerosphere, leading to depletion of the Earth's ozone layer and extreme weather phenomena such as El Niño, resulting in frequent global disasters [
9
,
10
].
As crude oil represents the largest proportion of primary energy sources, it inevitably contributes to major environmental damage through, e.g., CO
2
 emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that the ongoing surge in CO
2
 emissions resulting from crude oil is a substantial factor in the amplification of global warming and the regular occurrence of natural disasters, and the increasing use of renewable energy sources has yet to offset this trend [
11
]. However, the impact of CO
2
 emissions varies considerably among countries that export and import oil [
12
]. As an illustration, Alshehry and Belloumi [
13
] explored the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory [
14
] in Saudi Arabia between 1971 and 2011 and found no indication of an inverted U-shaped link between CO
2
 emissions from oil transportation and economic growth [
15
]. This indicates that crude oil exporting countries do not necessarily increase their CO
2
 emissions due to economic growth. However, taking Pakistan as an example, Rahman and Ahmad [
16
] identified that coal and crude oil consumption play a crucial role in CO
2
 emissions, and proved that there is an inverted U-shaped correlation in both the long run and the short run under the extended EKC theory [
17
]. This indicates that crude oil importing countries tend to experience a decrease in CO
2
 emissions after an initial increase due to economic growth. Similarly, in developing countries such as Bangladesh, which have no renewable energy sources, crude oil, natural gas, and refined oil are the major resources for the transportation sector, power production, and manufacturing plants, and there is a close correlation between the depletion of such energy inputs and CO
2
 emissions [
18
].
There are many reasons for the increase in CO
2
 emissions beyond petroleum consumption, including Bitcoin, which is based on blockchain technology. Given that Bitcoin has the largest market share in the cryptocurrency market as the top virtual currency, we suspected that there might be a connection between crude oil and Bitcoin, with Bitcoin representing a vital factor. Due to its decentralized nature, its price and trading volume are influenced by many factors. Some studies have shown that the price fluctuation of Bitcoin and crude oil have a two-way interrelation. For example, Jin et al. found a two-way spillover effect between oil and Bitcoin [
19
,
20
]. Bouri et al. found a significant connection between oil shocks and Bitcoin volatility, verifying the existence of a causal relationship over time at different time scales [
21
,
22
]. Jareño et al. confirmed that crude oil and cryptocurrency are more interdependent in times of economic turmoil [
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
]. Wang et al. found that the cryptocurrency environment attention index (ICEA) shows a significant positive correlation between Brent crude oil and Bitcoin [
28
]. Notably, a drastic reduction in the price of Bitcoin substantially affects the price of crude oil, with a noticeable impact on oil exporting countries [
29
]. Due to factors such as geopolitical events, production supply constraints in oil-producing countries, natural disasters, etc., the crude oil market can experience price volatility. Investors may seek decentralized and non-traditional markets, with factors influenced by Bitcoin as a hedge tool to mitigate the risks. However, Bitcoin's hedging properties do not just depend on market conditions, but also on various types of oil price trends. Selmi et al. used quantile regression to suggest that gold and Bitcoin can act as refuges in the crude oil market during turbulent times [
30
,
31
]. To our knowledge, there has not yet been any systematic investigation into the correlations among crude oil, Bitcoin, and CO
2
 emissions across time periods.
Bitcoin is strongly correlated with CO
2
 emissions. The process of mining Bitcoin requires a significant amount of electricity and computing power, which has a negative effect on the environment. As Bitcoin becomes more popular, its environmental damage is a worrying concern. Moreover, Bitcoin's high energy consumption and CO
2
 emissions also raise questions about the sustainability of cryptocurrency. The interrelation between Bitcoin and crude oil is reflected in the fact that Bitcoin mining uses a considerable amount of energy, and both require a lot of energy [
32
,
33
]. According to a 2017 report by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBSC), the crude oil refining sector accounts for 12.5% of the country's power consumption. The CO
2
 emissions from the crude oil refining industry involve the generation of electricity, steam, and heat [
11
]. Similarly, Bitcoin is a power-hungry entity, with annual power consumption for mining exceeding the electricity usage of Argentina, Austria, and Cyprus, and its CO
2
 emissions equivalent to the average level of Kansas City [
34
,
35
,
36
,
37
,
38
,
39
,
40
]. It is expected that in China, Bitcoin energy consumption will result in 130.5 million tons of CO
2
 emissions by 2024, exceeding the total annual carbon emissions of both Qatar and the Czech Republic [
41
]. In simpler terms, cryptocurrency mining contributes to the rise in energy consumption and the generation of CO
2
 emissions from mining-related pollution [
41
,
42
]. Studies have suggested that Bitcoin's energy consumption and carbon footprint are directly related to its transaction volume, with an increase in transaction volume causing a dynamic impact, leading to a 46.54% upsurge in its energy depletion and carbon footprint [
43
,
44
,
45
,
46
,
47
]. To address this issue, China banned cryptocurrency mining in 2021, leading to approximately half of the global miners migrating to neighboring countries such as Iran and Kazakhstan. While CO
2
 emissions immediately decreased in China, the problem shifted to those other regions and resulted in increased CO
2
 emissions there [
48
]. The CO
2
 emissions generated by cryptocurrency mining cause significant harm to the environment.
If CO
2
 emissions can be effectively reduced, the benefits to the global climate and the environment will be significant. This study argues that studying the relationship among crude oil, Bitcoin, and CO
2
 emissions can help to deepen our understanding of their complex interactions. While there has been considerable discussion on the interrelation between crude oil and CO
2
 emissions, crude oil and Bitcoin, or Bitcoin and CO
2
 emissions, there has been no research on the relationship among all three, with Bitcoin acting as the mediating variable.
The aim of this study was to analyze the direct or indirect relationship, or coexistence of both, between crude oil and CO
2
 emissions through Bitcoin. Quantile regression was employed to determine whether there is an inverted U-shaped nonlinear correlation between crude oil and CO
2
 emissions, and between Bitcoin and CO
2
 emissions. In addition, we also investigated whether Bitcoin has a moderating intermediate effect.
This study provides an innovative approach, adapting the mediation analysis approach proposed by Baron and Kenny [
49
] and Koenker and Bassett [
50
] with quantile regression. This approach can explore the dynamic causal effect of crude oil on CO
2
 emissions in the short term, regardless of its correlation with Bitcoin volatility. The objective is to achieve the goal of decreasing CO
2
 emissions based on exploring the relationships between them. Quantile regression models are highly advantageous due to their exceptional robustness, eliminating the need to make any presumptions about the distribution of error terms [
51
,
52
]. In addition, compared to traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which only explores the conditional expected value of the explanatory variable, quantile regression investigates the full range and conditional allocation of the response variable's median. Furthermore, the effect of the explanatory variable on the response variable fluctuates across quantiles, resulting in a more detailed and effective approach.

Previews Monday, June 5, 2023 at 7:00 p.m. Regular performances on Sunday, June 18 at 2:30 p.m. and Saturday, June 24 at 10:30 p.m.

This is the true story of a young woman whom the Wall Street Journal dubbed ""The Queen of Bitcoin,"" chronicling her spectacular rise....and sudden fall.

You don't have to know much about bitcoin before you see the show. Margaux will simply and concisely explain bitcoin and blockchain to you near the top of the proceedings, so that even those who profess to be mystified by cryptocurrency will be able to follow the narrative.

Margaux emerged from average beginnings and found as a young woman that she had an exceptional talent for entrepreneurship, co-creating and serving in executive positions in a number of web-based companies and enterprises. She continued to prosper as she headed into the worlds of cryptocurrency and high finance. But cryptocurrency is very much a boys' club, and she finds herself treated dismissively (at first) because of her gender, and experiences sexual harassment (she's attractive). A number of the executives with whom she comes in contact are also substance abusers, wildly partying and over-ingesting stuff from alcohol to LSD.

Nonetheless, she continues to soar as the Wall Street Journal proclaims her crypto-royalty. Also having a profile as a stand-up comedian, she's invited to MC the FTX Conference in the Bahamas. FTX, the exchange founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried, won't be around long (you'll know this if you read the news), and Margaux's fortunes will sink with it.

The Queen of Bitcoin: The Rise and Fall is the story of a daring woman, a feminist adventure, and a cautionary tale about money. Because Margaux is an experienced comedian, her tale is told with a significant degree of humor.

Margaux Avedisian's experience as an entrepreneur on the ground floor of innovative technology spans a decade. She is currently a standup comedian, host and CEO/Co-founder of a fashion technology startup, Beyond the Runway. In 2012 she relaunched the first American Bitcoin exchange and co-founded two others.. She has also served as Executive Vice President for the Transform Group from 2016-2018 during the ICO boom. She also MCed the FTX conference before its impending bust where Bill Clinton spoke. Margaux has connected hundreds of entrepreneurs with business leaders, technologists, policymakers, and creatives to promote tech startups and cryptocurrency. She has spoken at numerous conferences and had a podcast Burning Bridges with Margaux. She has a BA from Mount Holyoke College and an MFA in Fashion Merchandising from the Academy of Art University.

The CBO's projection is in line with the estimate by the Treasury Department that a U.S. default could occur on June 1.


CBO Sees ‘Significant Risk' of the U.S. Defaulting in June


The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an update to the Budget Outlook for 2023 to 2033 Friday. The report updates CBO's budget projections released in February.


'CBO's baseline projections are developed in accordance with procedures set in law. Those procedures require the agency to project spending, revenues, deficits, and debt without regard to the statutory limit on the issuance of new federal debt. That limit (now set at $31.4 trillion) was reached on January 19, 2023,' the report details, adding:


CBO estimates that if the limit is not raised or suspended, there is a significant risk that the Treasury will run out of funds at some point in the first two weeks of June.


The CBO's estimate aligns with that of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who 
said
 earlier this month that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government's bills as early as June 1 'if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.'
 
Many people have warned about the implications of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations. The 
International Monetary Fund
 (IMF) said there would be 'very serious repercussions.' Federal Reserve Chair 
Jerome Powell
 warned of 'uncertain and adverse' consequences. The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
Gary Gensler
, expects 'significant' and 'lasting effects' on investors, issuers, and markets. 
Goldman Sachs
 believes the consequences will be 'catastrophic.'


Meanwhile, former President and 2024 presidential candidate 
Donald Trump
 has urged Republican lawmakers to let the U.S. default on its debt if the Democrats do not agree to spending cuts. 'It's better than what we're doing right now because we're spending money like drunken sailors,' he said.


Do you think the U.S. will default on its debt obligations in June? Let us know in the comments section below.

191,What Is Bitcoin's Network Worth?,Madeline Hume,2023-05-22 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1159460/what-is-bitcoins-network-worth,morningstar.com,"This article, second in a series, attempts to answer that question by valuing bitcoin under the network effects approach.","Recently, we've been walking through common approaches to valuing bitcoin. 
Last week
 I wrote about estimating demand using the 'total addressable market' method, which gauges a new product's capacity for penetrating a market. This week, we're diving into the network effects model.
 
Whereas the total addressable market method is a 'top-down' approach to modeling bitcoin demand, the network effects model is 'bottom-up.' This method takes its name from a phenomenon known as a 
network effect
, which is when a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it.
 
Telephones are the classic example of a network effect. If there are only two telephone users in the world, each user only has one other person to call, and the telephone is probably not very useful. If each user has 50 other people whom they can call, a phone becomes more valuable.
 
Network effects can be powerful. Indeed, Morningstar's equity analysts identify network effects as one of five potential 'economic moat' sources that can grant a company durable competitive advantages over its peers.
 
While few would contest that network effects exist, there's much more debate over how much a network effect is worth. One approach, called Metcalfe's law, argues that a network's value is proportional to the possible number of connections that users could make with each other. Metcalfe's law further posits that the number of connections for a given user base follows a formula. For small networks, the formula looks like this ('N' stands for the number of users):
 
 
 
In practice, that relationship looks a little something like this:
 
 
 
As the network accumulates users, the growth in connections gradually approaches the square of the number of users in the system.
 
 
 
Today, stock-pickers still usually spot network effects empirically rather than using a theoretical approach. Using Metcalfe's law to estimate a network's value to a company is still relatively untested from an academic perspective.
 
Metcalfe's law is interesting, though, because it suggests that a company with a network effect won't generate revenues that are proportional to the 
number
 of users. Instead, it will generate revenues that are proportional to the number of connections between users—in other words, the number of users 
squared
.
 
What this means is a company enjoying network effects can generate exponential revenue growth even if their user base grows in a straight line. Meta, whose revenues grew exponentially compared with the number of users on its platform, is 
a case in point
.
 
 
 
Retooling the Formula for Bitcoin
 
Trying to model bitcoin with this approach is more complicated. A company can track the number of users on its platform; bitcoin does not. A company has annual revenues; bitcoin does not. Because we don't have access to this data, we have to make some substitutions.
 
We use the number of wallets on the blockchain as a proxy for users.
We also use the price of bitcoin as proxy for revenue.
 
These substituted variables, though useful, aren't perfect. That means we have to tweak the model in two ways.
 
We don't need to know how many shares of a stock a company has issued in order to estimate its revenue. For bitcoin, we do: The number of bitcoins that have been issued heavily influences the price. New bitcoins are minted every day, so we have to account for how the supply changes over time.
Valuations of bitcoin under Metcalfe's law commonly take 
the natural log
 of its input variables to calculate the price. This practice hails from foreign-exchange trading, where lognormal returns are commonly used to evaluate currency pairs.
 
Thus, with a few modifications, a simple formula like this:
 
 
 
Becomes this ('W' stands for wallets, and 'S' stands for supply of tokens):
 
 
 
This modified model does appear to have a decent ability to trace the arc of bitcoin's price history.
 
 
 
'Hang on,' you might be saying. 'I thought Metcalfe's law forecast exponential growth in value.' And you'd be right, but crucially, Metcalfe's law only promises exponential growth to those networks with a steadily growing user base.
 
Problem is, bitcoin's user base is anything but. Even with some smoothing, our data shows that the number of new wallets created in a single month peaked in late 2019. (In practice, it peaked about a year later amid the pandemic meme-stock frenzy.)
 
 
 
Putting It All Together
 
Now that we have our model, it's time to plug in some assumptions. We assume that the number of people opening wallets each month continues to taper off at its current rate, suggesting that the market will reach saturation at 87.5 million wallets. We expect that bitcoin will completely close that gap by 2027, four years from now.
 
 
 
Outside of our assumptions, we know two things for sure.
 
A mature population of wallets, plus a generous time horizon, implies a slow growth rate.
No matter what, bitcoin's algorithm will continue to issue tokens at a fairly predictable clip.
 
That implies that miners will mint new bitcoin faster than bitcoin can attract new users. If Metcalfe's law holds, this means that, as the token supply increases, then the price of bitcoin will drop.
 
How is that possible? Remember that the number of tokens issued is the denominator in our formula. That means that, as token issuance grows and user growth slows, our exponent shrinks, which causes the price to moderate relative to its current levels. Ultimately, this model projects a terminal price converging at around $32,500 in July 2027.
 
 
 
Limitations
 
Even though we end up with a seemingly clear price target, that doesn't mean it is time to run out to start shorting bitcoin. For one thing, remember that even in stock analysis, Metcalfe's law has only been studied a handful of times.
 
This could be at least partly because Metcalfe assumes a constant value per user, denoted VPU in our formulas. We know this doesn't hold empirically—companies are continually seeking to maximize how much money they can make off their users.
 
This limits the model's efficacy out-of-sample. Take a look at how the most famous Metcalfe's law model performed over the subsequent eight years after it was published.
 
 
 
Translating the model from stocks to crypto introduces additional wrinkles. Importantly, the number of wallets is a flawed proxy for users. In an ideal world, we would be able to measure the number of owners of bitcoin. In practice, many investors allow exchanges like Coinbase to hold custody of their bitcoin in Coinbase's proprietary wallets, which masks the total user base.
 
Finally, creating assumptions means that you're always at risk of being wrong. Our premise of declining growth in wallet creation could be a false one. We smoothed the original wallet growth data to get a symmetrical curve, but actual wallet creation data is slightly asymmetric because of the pandemic boom in crypto investment. Another regime change is always possible.
 
What's the Verdict?
 
It's a plain truth that neither the total addressable market approach nor the network effects approach is going to perfectly forecast demand for bitcoin. Because crypto is so new, these models are still very raw tools. But they do tell us something interesting about the practice of forecasting itself.
 
In general, the total addressable market approach struck an upbeat tone for bitcoin's future, while the network effects approach suggested a more dour outlook.
 
 
 
Even outside of crypto, this relationship is not unusual. A bottom-up approach like the network effects method will often sound a more cautionary note than a top-down approach like the total addressable market model. It's as true for stocks as it is for bitcoin—ask anyone who's compared a multiples-based valuation with a discounted cash flow valuation.
 
Neither method is necessarily more sound. Even so, as analysts, we tend to favor bottom-up forecasts. They're a healthy reminder that, in business, success is not destiny—it has to be earned. And just because an innovative product excites you does not mean that the rest of the world underestimates its worth. Sometimes, in investing, it pays to stay humble.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Madeline Hume",https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt60cc40ef3ea39649/5e8cae3b00dd7b79666d12d1/MadelineHume_3x2.jpg,False,@MorningstarInc,9.455785,881546ebd5a66b6e3e962d6ee5afba5e

This study aimed to uncover the impact of COVID-19 on the leading cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) and on sustainable finance with specific attention to their potential long memory properties. In this article, the application of the selected methodologies is based on a fractal and entropy analysis of the econometric model in the financial market. To detect the regularity/irregularity property of a time series, approximate entropy is introduced to measure deterministic chaos. Using daily data for Bitcoin and sustainable finance, namely DJSW, Green Bond, Carbon, and Clean Energy, we examine long memory behaviour by employing a rescaled range statistic (R/S) methodology. The results of the research present that the returns of Bitcoin, the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSW), Green Bond, Carbon, and Clean Energy have a significant long memory. Contrastingly, an interdisciplinary approach, namely wavelet analysis, is also used to obtain complementary results. Wavelet analysis can provide warning information about turmoil phenomena and offer insights into co-movements in the time–frequency space. Our findings reveal that approximate entropy shows crisis (turmoil) conditions in the Bitcoin market, despite the nature of the pandemic's origin. Crucially, compared to Bitcoin assets, sustainable financial assets may play a better safe haven role during a pandemic turmoil period. The policy implications of this study could improve trading strategies for the sake of portfolio managers and investors during crisis and non-crisis periods.


 










 


The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic shocked global financial markets, including cryptocurrency, commodities, and related crude oil energy markets. Numerous studies have studied the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially on cryptocurrency markets (e.g., [
1
,
2
,
3
]) and equity markets (e.g., [
4
,
5
]), commodity markets (e.g., [
6
]), crude oil markets ([
7
,
8
]), foreign exchange (FX) markets ([
9
,
10
]), and macroeconomic policy ([
11
,
12
]). Given the evidence, many mainstream studies have investigated the potential shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Elgin et al. [
13
] have documented the sustainable volatility driven by the turmoil of the pandemic and the subsequent increases in global markets. The recent literature has also investigated the performance of cryptocurrencies post-COVID-19 pandemic. Lahmiri et al. [
14
] have pointed out that the Bitcoin market showed irregularity, larger instability, and the characteristics of long memory and multifractality during the pandemic. Sarkodie et al. [
15
] have explored the implication of the COVID-19 pandemic on the price volatility of several major cryptocurrencies. However, the empirical relationships between cryptocurrency, global sustainable financial markets and the COVID-19 pandemic have been under-investigated. For the purpose of identifying research gaps, the major scope of this study provides fresh evidence that the persistence level in the Bitcoin and sustainable financial markets experienced adverse reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, few studies have taken wavelets into consideration to distinguish co-movements between Bitcoin and sustainable finance in the frequency and time dimensions. Notably, our work highlights the important matter of conducting long-range dependence and fractal analyses of the Bitcoin and sustainable financial markets during economic shocks and turmoil periods, such as the COVID-19 disturbance and climate extremes. In the relevant literature review, Jalan et al. [
16
] and Yarovaya et al. [
17
] found evidence that crashing cryptos do not recover or bounce back during times of crisis when there is much disturbance caused by an extreme external event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. It was found that cryptocurrencies have a volatile and unpredictable nature, and these cryptocurrencies are also highly risky in non-crises eras concerning the unpredictability of returns (e.g., [
18
]). Contrastingly, the evidence of long memory and fractal connectivity and their implications for market efficiency resembles that of [
19
,
20
,
21
]. The authors investigated the market efficiency or inefficiency of crypto-assets, employing long-rang dependence methods. Other studies, such as that of Keshari Jena et al. [
22
], provide evidence that Bitcoin is the third most inefficient cryptocurrency, while DASH and NEM have been found to be the most inefficient cryptocurrencies.
Loosely speaking, gold, in particular, is considered a dominant safe haven property for market participants and portfolio managers during crisis times [
18
,
23
,
24
]. On the other hand, there is a question as to whether Bitcoin and sustainable financial markets may play the role of a safe haven asset amid concerns due to pandemic turmoil. This study aims to answer this question.
Additionally, the rapidly growing literature on climate finance has identified that green bonds and ESG assets can be effective hedging tools against climate risk [
25
]. Moreover, both green bonds and clean energy equities can offer diversification benefits for market participants with energy equities [
26
,
27
]. As concern over the systemic risk of global warming and climate change continues, attention is being drawn to reducing the idiosyncratic risk of carbon assets. To achieve the objective of promoting ESG transparency, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC provides four carbon exposure metrics for world carbon-efficient indices to aid investors in measuring, recognizing, and administrating carbon risk.
According to the S&P Dow Jones Indices, the carbon exposure metrics are as follows:
(1)
Carbon footprint: The primary and operational supply chain carbon footprints of the index components per USD one million in investment are aggregated.
(2)
Weighted average carbon intensity: The intensity-weighted mean of the individual corporate intensities, weighted as proportions of each component of the index.
(3)
Carbon efficiency: The primary and operational supply chain carbon footprints of index components per USD one million in revenues are aggregated.
(4)
Fossil fuel reserves: The possible carbon footprint that may result from the feasible and proven fossil fuel reserves of the index components being burned, for every USD one million invested.
Additionally, this work ultimately builds upon previous studies in several important ways, and offers the following three major contributions.
First, the existing literature on nonlinear dependence and causality volatility in price behaviour only utilizes stationary time series. To fill this gap, an approximate entropy methodology is utilized, which does not require any stationary assumption. 
Second, unlike previous studies, we pay attention to providing insightful evidence regarding the safe haven capacity of risk exposures, and then observe the potential information of approximate entropy among Bitcoin, sustainable finance, and fears regarding the impact of COVID-19.
Third, we fill a significant research gap; scarce literature considers wavelet analysis for exploring Bitcoin and sustainable finance co-movements in frequency and time dimensions.
As far as we know, this is the first article to uncover information linkages between Bitcoin, sustainable finance, and the impact of COVID-19. Subsequently, we analyse whether Bitcoin and these sustainable financial assets can be regarded as safe haven assets amid fears regarding the COVID-19 crisis. From a practical viewpoint, and in the context of the fight against climate change, our findings suggest that sustainable financial assets may play a better safe haven role during periods of turmoil such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The paper is laid out in four sections. 
Section 2
 presents our empirical design and econometric model. 
Section 3
 presents the research data. 
Section 4
 presents the research methodology and analyses estimation results, and 
Section 5
 concludes the article.
Financial markets have a potentially fractal nature, especially regarding the relative tendency of a time series to revert strongly to the mean or cluster in a nonlinear characteristic; thus, the Hurst exponent is commonly introduced to capture fractality (e.g., [
28
]). In addition, the Hurst exponent (HE) and rescaled range (R/S) analyses are generally applied to measure the long memory of a time series (see [
29
,
30
] among others). 
Motivated by the above discussion, and to examine the long memory of these series, we use the HE as computed via rescaled range statistics. Then, HE is used to categorise a time series, and offers a statistical measure for the fractal geometry of the time series and long-term correlation memory. The memory is also called long-range dependence, implying the existence of interdependence between the observed periods of time series, even though these are separated periods.
The long-term memory statistics of a rescaled range (R/S) fractal analysis are described below. In this study, we consider the logarithmic returns of cryptocurrency to be sustainable financial assets denoted as the time series

, and the steps of the R/S analysis can be summarized as follows.
Step 1: Determine the profile of subsample means. The mean of the 
m
 value is computed as follows: 
Step 2: The demeaned return return (deviate) mean adjusted series 
Y
 is computed as the following Equation (2).

Step 3: Regarding the cumulative sum of diminished returns, the cumulative deviate series

 can be computed:
Alternatively, Equation (3) can be written as

Step 4: The subsample range is computed as the max minus min of the cumulative deviate, based on the following equation: 
Step 5: Compute the standard deviation of the S series as follows:
Step 6: Calculating the rescaled range (
R
/
S
) series, it is easy to infer the following definition:
where 








(


R

)






t








 denotes the mean across the districts, and can be described as the average over all the partial time series, until where 
m
 = floor(
n
/
t
), assuming that there is a time series with 
n
 observations for equal intervals of time. The observations are divided into 
m
 floor (sub-periods) with the same number of observations t, such as 
m
 × 
t
 = 
n
. Accordingly, 
m
 = floor(
n
/
t
).
Eventually, the Hurst exponent indicates that (R/S) scales are estimated by fitting the power law as the time grows, which can be shown as follows.

In this scenario, 
c
 refers to a constant, and t represents 
n
 observations in the sub-periods. 
H
 is termed the HE (Hurst exponent), and taking the logarithm for Equation (6), the HE can be expressed.

The HE is the Hurst exponent, and characterizes the long memory dependence. The different scenarios have been classified as follows: 
(1)
H
 = 0.50 shows the given time series that follows a random walk governed by standard Brownian motion. The recent time will not affect the upcoming future direction.
However, if 
H
 ≠ 0.5, the related time series shows evidence of long-term correlations.
(2)
0 ≤ 
H
 < 0.50, the time series have the properties of a state that is ergodic or anti-persistent.
(3)
0.50 ≤ 
H
 < 1.00 indicates that the time series exhibits persistent or trend-reinforcing behaviours, also called persistent memory.
Importantly, it should be noted that the R/S analysis does not require the underlying values to follow the normal distribution; this only applies to independent values. Therefore, the Hurst exponent 
H
 ranges between 0 and 1, whose value implies some features of the process, see [
28
,
31
].
To provide a focused analysis of the potential information transmission patterns of Bitcoin, sustainable finance, and the impact of COVID-19, we employ an approximate entropy approach to capture the unique features of these assets. The ApEn model acts as the joint behaviour of the series introduced by [
32
,
33
] during the turmoil of the pandemic. The ApEn is related to information theory, a useful measure that allows one to easily estimate the amount adequate entropy in order to classify finite, noisy, and chaotic systems [
34
]. To address the limitations of the information reduction carried by the signal, and uncover such signals containing random noise, approximate entropy can quantify regularity and complexity. The entropy is utilized to characterize persistent diversity patterns, and evaluates the level of irregularities (random fluctuations) through extraction of disturbances from a finite time series of length 
N
. An algorithm for computing the approximate entropy (briefly denoted as ApEn) of financial time series data is summarized as follows.
First of all, to compute the ApEn, a finite time series is considered, and a defined series of data with length 
N
 sampled at time intervals (Ts) can be described in the following form: where length 
N
 represents a respective time scale 




τ




 = 
NTs
 for a given stochastic variable (








r






i








). The ApEn algorithm is conducted, and it will contain the given two parameter values. Here, the embedding dimension (
m
) is the length of a pattern, and the tolerance level (
r
) represents the likelihood that resemblance exists between these patterns. Typically, we introduce parameter selection as 
m
 = 2 and 
m
 = 3 to estimate the values of ApEn, given the data length of 
N
 = 2110.
Then, we consider the two 
m
-vectors [i.e., 








X






i








,








X






j








], which can be obtained with the following step:
where 
i
 ≠ 
j,
 1 ≤ 
i
 and 
j
 ≤ 
N
 − 
m
+1, and 
m
 is the number of vectors.
In Step 2, using a tolerance factor 
r
, we compute the distance between the two sequences. The distance between these two sequences is described as the maximum difference between 








X






i








 and 








X






j








, as follows:
where 0 ≤ 
k
 ≤ 
m
−1.
In the same way, the scalar 








X






i








 corresponding to the distances in the respective scalar 








X






j








 is compared with a template match between 








X






i








 and 








X






j








. In case the distance between the corresponding scalar compositions (Equation (10)) is less than 
r
, the two embedded vectors maintain similarity. 
In the third step, we account for the probability of the data 








X






j






,




 which means there exists a degree of tolerance of

Cryptocurrencies are said to be very risky, and so are the currencies of emerging economies, including the South African rand. The steady rise in the movement of South Africans' investments between the rand and BitCoin warrants an investigation as to which of the two currencies is riskier. In this paper, the Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) model is employed to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) for the two exchange rates, BitCoin/US dollar (BitCoin) and the South African rand/US dollar (ZAR/USD). The estimated risk measures are used to compare the riskiness of the two exchange rates. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method is used to find the optimal parameters of the GPD model. The higher extreme value index estimate associated with the BTC/USD when compared with the ZAR/USD estimate, suggests that the BTC/USD is riskier than the ZAR/USD. The computed VaR estimates for losses of 
$
0.07, 
$
0.09, and 
$
0.16 per dollar invested in the BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99% compared to the ZAR/USD's 
$
0.02, 
$
0.02, and 
$
0.03 at the respective levels of significance, confirm that BitCoin is riskier than the rand. The ES (average losses) of 
$
0.11, 
$
0.13, and 
$
0.21 per dollar invested in the BTC/USD at 90%, 95%, and 99% compared to the ZAR/USD's 
$
0.02, 
$
0.02, and 
$
0.03 at the respective levels of significance further confirm the higher risk associated with BitCoin. Model adequacy is confirmed using the Kupiec test procedure. These findings are helpful to risk managers when making adequate risk-based capital requirements more rational between the two currencies. The argument is for more capital requirements for BitCoin than for the South African rand.


 










 


Investment in digital currencies, such as BitCoin, has been on a steady rise since the inception of cryptocurrencies globally and in South Africa. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised currencies that are traded on a blockchain technology platform without the regulations of a central bank. BitCoin tops the list of traded cryptoassets in terms of traded volume with a market capitalisation of 452.1 billion dollars (
Tretina 2023
).
Risk sentiment describes the risk appetite of market players (traders and investors), particularly their willingness (tolerance) to invest in a riskier asset or portfolio, e.g., risk sentiment towards emerging countries' currencies (
Grable 2000
). Risk sentiment is important when the economic forecasts of one or some emerging countries are unfavourable, economic indicators are negative, and the markets are indicating a higher level of price instability. Some of the emerging economies maybe doing well economically but will still nonetheless have their currencies weakened or affected through such negative sentiment or through contagion (
Fratzscher 2002
). Investors move their currencies from emerging countries to 'safe haven assets' which may not be affected by this negative sentiment around emerging countries (
Almeida and Gonçalves 2023
). South Africa is an emerging economy and is vulnerable to any negative sentiment around emerging economies (
Davies 2017
).
The South African rand is a central bank regulated currency; the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) moved towards a flexible exchange rate in 1994 (
Van Der Merwe 1996
). A flexible exchange rate allows market forces (supply and demand) to drive the pricing of currency, resulting in the rand experiencing a significant increase in volatility (
Joale 2011
). Thus, the rand is affected by speculation; hence, it is perceived as being risky (
Pretorius and De Beer 2002
).
Cryptocurrencies are said to be very risky (
Kaseke et al. 2021
). Emerging economies' currencies, including the South African rand, are equally risky (
Joale 2011
). The question arises as to which of the two is riskier?
Extreme Value Theory is a field in statistics that measures and models extreme events (large fluctuations) using fat-tailed statistical distribution models. Risky assets have fat tails (more extreme observations than normal distribution allows for). Therefore, the application of EVT models is considered more appropriate to capture the financial risk of the BitCoin and rand exchange rates. This branch of statistics was pioneered by 
Fisher and Tippett
 (
1928
) and 
Pickands
 (
1975
). The purpose of this study is to fit the Extreme Value Theory (EVT)-based Generalised Pareto Distribution (the GPD) to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). The two risk measures are used to compare the riskiness of the two assets. The GPD is preferred as it analyses extreme/tail-related risk.
Giving an analogy in a different field on the need to analyse extremes: '…why worry about the average rainfall, when it is extreme amounts of rainfall that cause a flood, or it is extreme low rainfall that causes a drought leading to untold suffering'. It makes sense to sometimes concentrate on analysing extremes as provided for in EVT. Classical statistical methodology often has an over-emphasis around the average or mean measure.
The VaR is a statistical risk measure of a financial portfolio of assets. It is the largest value or amount expected to be lost over a specified time horizon, i.e., daily, weekly, or ten days, at a pre-defined statistical confidence level, p, and it quantifies the riskiness of an asset. Although investors and practitioners rely heavily on the VaR as a risk measure because of its ability to compress all Greeks to a single value (
Hull 2006
), it has shortcomings (
Chou and Wang 2014
). It is incoherent and also fails to precisely estimate the risk of loss when the loss distributions have 'fat tails', unless EVT distributions are used (
Rockafellar and Uryasev 2002
). 'This significantly discredits the accuracy of the traditional Normal distribution based VaR risk measure' (
Chen 2018
). To address the normal model distributional-related VaR weaknesses highlighted above, the EVT theory-based GPD is suggested in this study. 
Artzner et al.
 (
1999
) introduced a risk measure called the Expected Shortfall and called it 'a perfect risk measure'. 
Pflug
 (
2000
) showed that the ES is a coherent risk measure.
However, it must be noted that the ES is not elicitable (
Gneiting 2011
), i.e., it does not minimise the expected loss function; thus, the measure may not be as accurate as estimates of the VaR (
Yamai and Yoshiba 2002
) and it is difficult to backtest (
Hull 2006
).
This paper uses the GPD model to compare the riskiness of BitCoin and South African rand returns using VaR and ES. Both currencies are measured against the US dollar. The steady rise in the movement of investments between the rand and BitCoin since the introduction of cryptocurrency influenced the selection of the two financial assets. The GPD model allows for the analysis of extreme gains and losses that may be associated with investing in BitCoin. The rand is also another developing country's currency which is considered to be very risky. When analysing the extreme gains and losses, which of the two currencies is riskier?
The research will help foreign currency traders and investors to understand the extreme/tail risk they are taking when they convert their savings/investments to BitCoin instead of the South African currency, the rand. Furthermore, the findings are helpful to risk managers when making adequate risk-based capital requirements more rational between the two currencies. The argument is for more capital requirements for the riskier currency between the two exchange rates.
Several statistical risk/loss models have been developed to better capture the fat-tail property of financial assets in recent times. 
Yousof et al.
 (
2023b
) proposed a new reciprocal Weibull extension for modelling extreme values, 
Ibrahim et al.
 (
2023
) proposed a novel compound reciprocal Rayleigh extension model. 
Yousof et al.
 (
2023a
) proposed a novel flexible extension of the Chen distribution called the generalised Rayleigh Chen (GRC) and compared the performance of this new model with other Chen extension distributions, namely Gamma-Chen, Kumaraswamy Chen, Beta-Chen, Marshall–Olkin Chen, Transmuted Chen, and the traditional two-parameter Chen. Most of the distributions mentioned in this literature concentrate their fit around where most of the data are concentrated, around the average. Sometimes there is a need to depart from the average thinking and concentrate on the tails of statistical distributions. The GPD concentrates the distribution fit exclusively on these tails, allowing it to explore and explain extreme returns better than the various Weibull distributions mentioned herein.
In measuring financial tail-related risk using the EVT models, the Extreme Value Index (EVI) parameter dictates the tail behaviour of the returns' distribution (
Rached and Larsson 2019
). This parameter is an indicator of how the tail of a distribution decays (
Beirlant et al. 2005
).The advantage of the GPD over the Weibull family models and related distributions, such as the exponential and Rayleigh models, lies in its ability to take a continuous range of possible shapes influenced by the EVI, which includes the exponential and Pareto distributions as special cases. The Generalised Pareto Distribution allows one to 'let the data decide' which of these distributions is appropriate, instead of having to select a particular form of the parent distribution.
Balkema and de Haan
 (
1974
) and 
Pickands
 (
1975
) showed that for large enough thresholds, 




u




's, data exceedance distributions above these thresholds can be estimated by a Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD). The Peak over Threshold (PoT) approach to the GPD involves selecting a threshold, 




u




, and extracting values from the data that are considered extreme (exceedances above this threshold). The new data set is then used to create a model (the GPD) for the extreme values. To compute the VaR and ES, the GPD model parameters, including the EVI, must be estimated.
Studies are ongoing to determine the similarities of cryptocurrency features to those of other financial assets. 
Kaseke et al.
 (
2021
) detected some distributional similarities between cryptocurrencies, Gold and the FTSE/JSE 40, though the cryptocurrencies are slightly more volatile. 
Takaishi
 (
2018
) noted a fat-tail feature in BitCoin data. 
Bouri et al.
 (
2017
) observed a high volatility in BitCoin in comparison to other stock returns.
Dyhrberg
 (
2016
) argued that BitCoin and gold returns can be used for hedging as they are not affected by financial market shocks. Conversely, 
Shanaev and Ghimire
 (
2021
) noted a relative stability in BitCoin and Ethereum using asymmetric power-law statistical distributions.
This paper uses the GPD model to compare the riskiness of BitCoin and South African rand returns using VaR and ES. The GPD is preferred because of its ability to analyse extremes in returns and to take a continuous range of possible shapes influenced by the EVI.
At times, there is a need to depart from the average and symmetrical thinking around losses and gains, and exploit information provided by the extreme returns. This helps to understand how extremes affect an investment. The survival of an investment company is not only influenced by the means of the distributions, but by the tails of distributions as well. Extreme losses can mean the investment company closes.
The Peak over Threshold (PoT) approach used in fitting the GPD is used to model extreme returns.
Balkema and de Haan
 (
1974
) and 
Pickands
 (
1975
) showed that for large enough thresholds,

(Nasdaq: BTCS) ('BTCS' or the 'Company'), a blockchain technology-focused company, today...","Silver Spring, MD, June 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) ('BTCS' or the 'Company'), a blockchain technology-focused company, today addresses the recent Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') action against Coinbase regarding its staking operations and clarifies the differences between BTCS's non-custodial staking model and the practices that the SEC has taken issue with.
 
Today, the SEC took action against Coinbase for its staking operations among other things. Similar to Coinbase, BTCS conducted a thorough analysis over two years ago, concluding in our view, that 'Core Staking' as defined by Coinbase, does not create a security. BTCS performs 'Core Staking' under the terminology of 'non-custodial staking' or 'staking-as-a-service'. While Coinbase's analysis under the Howey test is valuable (link: 
here
) and we commend their efforts, it is important to note that in a February 10, 2023 
blog post
, they state 
'At Coinbase, our core staking service is offered through our Coinbase Earn program, which allows users to stake certain assets for a recurring payment from the blockchain protocol.
'
 However, in the Coinbase Earn program, Coinbase takes your private keys, i.e. they hold your crypto, which is a material difference and not in line with their own analysis and assertion under the Howey test regarding an investment of money. By presenting an argument that doesn't apply to the SEC's concerns, Coinbase is muddying the waters and doing a disservice to companies like BTCS, the crypto industry, the general public, and regulators.
 
BTCS's CEO, Charles Allen, states, 'Following the FTX fiasco, industry leaders should be transparent, especially with respect to rules that are clearly black and white versus those that need further clarity. We should work to educate regulators, politicians, and the general public in a positive way to ensure any new regulations or the interpretation of current regulations allow the U.S. to become a leader in blockchain innovation.'
 
BTCS's non-custodial staking-as-a-service platform, StakeSeeker, significantly differs from other industry staking programs. StakeSeeker only operates a non-custodial model, which contrasts with the custodial models utilized by Kraken, Coinbase, and others. The differences between BTCS's StakeSeeker model and the custodial models under scrutiny have been outlined in our recent press release on 
February 10, 2023
, where we clarified how StakeSeeker operates within the parameters of the Howey test and does not in our view create securities. The following table summarizes the key differences between BTCS's, Coinbase's, and Kraken's business models which the SEC has taken issue with.

Allen continues 'We believe it is essential to differentiate between non-custodial staking models like ours and the practices that have been called into question by regulators. We have proactively analyzed our staking model and drawn conclusions that align with those presented by Coinbase regarding 'Core Staking' and while we believe our non-custodial staking does not create securities, we cannot provide assurances that either the SEC or other regulatory authorities will agree.'
 
'As the oldest public company in the crypto and blockchain sector, we have learned many lessons over the years. Our commitment to offering a transparent, secure, and compliant non-custodial staking model demonstrates our dedication to the best interests of the industry and the general public.' stated Allen.

(PRWEB) June 06, 2023 -- LINER (Lightning Network Rate), was created as a novel index to measure bitcoin returns on the Lightning Network, demonstrating its potential for low-risk…","By communicating real yield rates from bitcoin held on the LN, enterprises will recognize the strategic error in trusting CeFi yield platforms while capturing the benefits of payment network disruption that is decades overdue
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore. (PRWEB)
 
June 06, 2023
 
 
Amboss
, the leading data analytics provider for the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), announces the launch of LINER (Lightning Network Rate), a first-of-its-kind index that demonstrates low risk yield for enterprise bitcoin holders for the first time. LINER can be thought of as a benchmark interest rate for bitcoin free from credit risk. 
 
LINER is similar to the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) in traditional finance, which is a benchmark interest rate for short-term loans between global banks, except LINER is free from credit risk. In other words, LINER is well-positioned to be an alternative to enterprises seeking exposure to bitcoin without the credit risk that imploded CeFi yield platforms towards the end of 2022.
 
Jesse Shrader, Co-Founder and CEO of 
Amboss
, shared, ""By communicating real yield rates from bitcoin held on the LN, enterprises will recognize the strategic error in trusting CeFi yield platforms while capturing the benefits of payment network disruption that is decades overdue.'
 
Nik Bhatia, creator of 
The Bitcoin Layer
, a premium markets research provider, analyzing bitcoin through a global macro lens, articulated, ""LINER is a first-of-its-kind reference rate derived entirely from the Lightning Network adjacent to Bitcoin. Unlike traditional reference rates that are set by a central bank like the Fed, LINER and other LN-native rates are derived entirely by free market forces — the first step towards money markets unmanipulated by a central authority, much less fragile and prone to the booms and busts of the traditional monetary order. The first step toward building any active capital market is a regularly-published and updated yield curve to attract capital allocators. Amboss is taking the first step toward bringing this concept to reality, and bringing Bitcoin over LN one step closer to denominating the future of our world financial system.""
 
Allen Farrington, writer and investor, said, 'Just as with LIBOR in traditional finance, it is incredibly useful to have a reference rate for the true cost of capital. It's clear that Lightning Network is quickly becoming a self-sustaining financial ecosystem to support both retail and enterprise needs. Tools like Amboss' LINER are needed to see the next wave of enterprise adoption of Lightning.'
 
Amboss operates 
Magma
, a marketplace for buying and selling Lightning channels. Lightning channels create new pathways for payments in the Lightning Network. Selling lightning channels on Magma enables bitcoin savers to earn BTC from opening lightning channels to destinations like online stores, wallets, or other lightning users. Since lightning channels are self-custodial ways to hold bitcoin, Magma enables novel bitcoin yield without custodial risk, avoiding the pitfalls of failed CeFi yield platforms like Celsius and BlockFi.
 
Bitcoin yield with Magma comes from the liquidity needs of lightning-enabled payment destinations. Given the global demand for rapid settlement and low risk profile, Amboss is equipping users with a key metric, LINER, to show the ROI generated from selling lightning channels as well as associated costs.
 
Amboss created LINER as a novel and insightful dual index, including LINER Cost and LINER Yield, to measure both sides of the lightning market: buyers of liquidity and sellers of liquidity. This benchmark provides enterprises with insight into the opportunities within the lightning network, both for cost savings versus traditional settlement methods and low-risk yield versus holding bitcoin in cold storage. 
 
With these new LINER metrics, enterprises can make direct comparisons from the LINER Cost to traditional payment card fees. Large bitcoin holders can now weigh the opportunity cost of not deploying cold storage bitcoin to the Lightning Network, or rethink their strategy of using trusted bitcoin custodians. Now, there is a clear incentive for large holders to put their bitcoin to work in a self-custodial fashion while earning higher returns from their bitcoin holdings at minimal risk. 
 
Jonathan Bier, author and investor, said, 'The creation of this index is certainly an interesting development. If Bitcoin is successful, perhaps in the future this rate will be considered an important reference rate, used by portfolio managers when making Bitcoin based investment decisions. If LINER is 4%, a return that is 'custodial risk free,' perhaps Bitcoin denominated investors will demand a premium to this rate when considering making a loan or other investment. Alternatively, perhaps speculators, lightning liquidity providers or other businesses may wish to trade derivative contracts based on LINER.'

The Lightning Network (LN), a second-layer protocol built atop Bitcoin, promises swift, low-cost transactions, thereby addressing blockchain scalability and enhancing user privacy. As the global financial technology landscape evolves, the LN's importance in the future of fintech and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) becomes increasingly pivotal. The anticipated rise of blockchain-based payments and smart contracts in businesses demands a more agile and secure payment system. However, the LN's early stage raises valid concerns about security and reliability, especially when implemented on a huge asymmetric network such as the Internet, potentially hindering its broader adoption. Malicious nodes could intentionally cause payment failures or initiate attacks, such as DDoS attacks, by overwhelming other nodes in the network with channel-opening requests. As a result, users will be discouraged from using the LN; hence, the technology will become obsolete as individuals will not waste the time and power investment required for using this technology. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes an innovative invitation model protocol (IMP) to reinforce the LN's security and reliability. The IMP creates an exclusive ‘Club' within the LN, admitting only nodes verified as honest, thereby bolstering network security and reliability. The protocol empowers Club Founders to expel members exhibiting malicious activities, thereby preserving the invested time, energy, and funds of the network's users. The IMP was rigorously tested using Amazon Web Services Virtual Machines within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network's Testnet environment, which is a highly asymmetric network. The results demonstrated the protocol's efficacy in fulfilling its objectives, marking a significant step towards a safer and more efficient blockchain transaction network. As the blockchain continues to revolutionize the financial sector, implementing robust security measures such as the IMP becomes essential. This research paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing the reliability and security of a Lightning Network (LN), and thus distinguishes itself from the existing literature, by introducing an additional step before establishing or joining such a network. The research underscores the critical role of such protocols in realizing the potential of the LN in powering the next wave of fintech and industrial innovation.


 










 


Technology is constantly evolving, resulting in continuous global change in people's lives. For instance, people can use smartphones and tablets to pay for travel and even groceries within seconds while sitting at home. Moreover, technology impacts the world's financial and economic future dramatically. For example, business transactions are continuously moving from cash-based to electronic-based transactions. Further, the worldwide expansion of the Internet in recent years, and its quick acceptance and usage among people, have contributed to simplifying electronic commerce in business environments globally [
1
]. As a result, electronic payment systems surfaced to replace cash payment systems as business owners headed towards e-commerce platforms, which led most businesses worldwide to adopt this technology [
2
].
E-payment systems have gained a lot of interest and attracted researchers and developers in information technology due to the crucial role these systems have in modern e-commerce. Hence, the importance of e-payment systems has prompted several researchers to perform extensive research that resulted in various views on such systems [
3
,
4
].
Bitcoin, which was first introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system based on encryption and a distributed public ledger [
5
]. According to Kim and Jeong [
6
], the distributed ledger is also referred to as the blockchain. Additionally, the blockchain is used to record every executed transaction in the system without any need for a trusted third party. This distributed database leverages distributed ledger technology to prevent data tampering and fabrication. In addition, the researchers stated that the blockchain offers several advantages over a typical centralized system, including efficiency, security, resilience, and transparency. In the literature, many studies have been performed to implement blockchain in different daily life applications, such as: securing cloud-based peer-to-peer transactions [
7
]; manufacturing processes [
8
]; the Internet of Vehicles [
9
]; higher education certificate authentication [
10
]; and many more.
Still, the Bitcoin network has a significant limitation that many researchers are currently trying to overcome, which is the scalability of the blockchain. Specifically, the Bitcoin blockchain allows only a limited number of transactions to be validated through the network, ranging from three to seven transactions per second. Therefore, numerous researchers have sought to resolve the scalability issue through various methods. For example, El Azzaou et al. [
11
] presented a lightweight scalable authentication solution based on blockchain to secure videoconferences. The researchers employed a time-based consensus approach to decrease latency, mining processing cost, and boost.
Moreover, one of the major solutions that have been developed is payment channels, such as the Lightning Network (LN). The LN is a second-layer technology built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that provides users with fast payment channels held off-chain in a trustless environment [
6
]. The Lightning Network is a routed network proposed for bidirectional payment channels that are end-to-end connected [
12
]. Members of an LN can route payments through numerous channels without needing trusted intermediaries [
13
]. Moreover, payment transactions can be executed off-chain with minimal fees through an LN. As a result, not all bitcoin transactions are recorded in the main blockchain [
14
]. Thus, the LN is less expensive, faster, and provides additional privacy for transactions that are not visible on the public blockchain. In a Lightning Network, a channel between two parties is established temporarily for a period, during which each party locks in an identical amount of money as collateral. Furthermore, both parties can exchange money back-and-forth during the channel time with just the netting transaction being validated and preserved in the Bitcoin blockchain [
15
]. Additionally, a malicious party that fails to update the channel balance will forfeit the collateral (deposited when the channel was first opened) to the other party.
LN provides several benefits like anonymity, speed, and trustless transactions [
16
], tackling Bitcoin's scalability issue without altering network protocols. Some challenges exist, such as potential transaction delays, dependency on the main blockchain, and the complexity of cryptographic network protocols.
Various studies have been conducted to improve the LN. Valente et al. [
17
] analyzed the LN's underlying structure and its impact on the system, focusing on the network's liquidity and resilience. However, the paper lacked certain details and clear contribution statements. Nowostawski et al. [
18
] highlighted the potential for leaked data from the off-chain network to the blockchain, which could reveal user information. They also proposed methods to identify unique transactions in the LN. Conoscenti et al. [
19
] addressed three issues that need resolution in LN technology: the development of Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) payments, estimating optimization effects, and predicting profits from investing in a network hub. Seres et al. [
20
] assessed LN's topology to enhance its security, demonstrating its robustness against random and targeted attacks. Rohrer et al. [
21
] analyzed LN's topology and proposed certain attacks that could disrupt the LN. Pérez-Sola et al. [
22
] described an attack that could lower a node's channel capacity, limiting its network communication. Zhang et al. [
23
] introduced a distributed simulator that reduced transaction fees along a payment channel, though it faced constraints regarding the success rate and average transaction value.
Many researchers suggested considering the balance of a channel in an LN as crucial information [
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
]. This would enable users to find a viable payment path quickly [
28
,
29
]. Other research explored the balance between privacy and efficiency in payment channel networks. For instance, Tang et al. [
30
] used noise addition to increase privacy, albeit at efficiency's expense. Integrating blockchain and LN technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) for instant payment applications is another research focus [
31
,
32
,
33
,
34
,
35
,
36
,
37
]. Furthermore, a solution based on a game-theoretic model to analyze griefing attacks in Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) called HTLC-GPZ was presnted to provides improved protection against such attacks [
38
].
Other researchers proposed a study that focused he privacy implications and vulnerabilities present in the Lightning Network. The authors likely conduct a thorough analysis of the network's privacy features, focusing on aspects such as transaction linkability, address reuse, and potential deanonymization attacks. making it more difficult for attackers to identify and target specific payment channels [
39
]. 
Given the rise in Bitcoin use around the world, it is expected that the use of the LN for point-of-sale (POS) systems and small payment platforms will grow at an exponential rate. The LN is excellent for small quick payments, such as those made at coffee shops or grocery stores. It avoids the inconvenience of having to wait 10 minutes for blockchain approval at the POS. Because of this, the need for a safer LN is growing. To understand how payments work in the LN, consider a simple case with only four nodes: A, B, C, and D. In this situation, shown in 
Figure 1
, these nodes have opened symmetrical bidirectional payment channels in pairs, represented by blue arrows. Further, each channel is funded with 2 bitcoin by each participant. Consequently, the channel balance for each of the payment channels in the network is 4 bitcoin.
The Lightning Network logic states that node A does not need a direct payment channel with node D to send any bitcoin amount. Instead, node A will use paths A, B, C, and D to reach node D indirectly and send the intended bitcoin amount, without spending additional funds to open a new channel with node D. For instance, if node A intends to send 1 BTC to node D, A will discover the route between payment channels (A through D) and connect to node D through the Internet to receive a hash value (H) of a secret key (R) that is owned by node D. Later, A will construct a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC); this virtual channel is represented by a white arrow in 
Figure 1
, which is a type of smart contract that permits participants to commit funds to a redeemable secret key with a time limit and is utilized in both bidirectional and routed payment channels. The constructed HTLC would include a refund after a 9-block timeout for the amount of 1.002, payable to the hash H. The extra 0.002 BTC amount offered by A is used to pay to the intermediaries B and C and is deducted from the channel balance of node A as a fee to forward the payment. Afterwards, node A offers the HTLC to node B, which indicates that B will receive 1.002 BTC from A only if B can provide the secret key (R). Otherwise, a transaction timeout will occur after 9 blocks. Node A will get the amount back. Afterwards, node B will repeat the same process with node C. Still, instead of committing 1.002 BTC of the channel balance and the same 9-block timeout, node B will create another HTLC that is slightly different to the one offered by node A. More precisely, node B will construct an HTLC with 1.001 BTC and an 8-block timeout for a refund payable to the hash H, taking 0.001 BTC as a commission for forwarding the payment to the next node down the same path. Then, node C will repeat the same process, constructing and committing an HTLC with 1.000 BTC and a 7-block timeout for node D. Finally, node D will present the secret R to node C to claim the 1 BTC from the HTLC that node C offered and add the received amount to the channel balance. Moving back along the same route, each node sends the secret key (R) to the previous node, claims the HTLC committed previously, and updates the channel balance. In the end, node A will have paid node D an amount of 1 BTC without opening a direct payment channel and spending more funds. Instead, node A is only required to pay a minimal amount of BTC to intermediate nodes that can forward the payment to the intended destination. 
Figure 2
 illustrates a ladder diagram that illustrates the step-by-step process explained above.
Nonetheless, Lightning Network (LN) technology is still in its infancy. As a result, academics have performed several studies to develop this technology in various ways. However, other LN vulnerabilities have not been explored in the literature; in particular, rogue nodes intending to perform specific attacks that might undermine network security and reliability. The literature, however, allowed for any LN node to join the LN freely and instantaneously. As a result, the danger level of LN technology will grow as malicious nodes can join the network and conduct attacks, such as intentional cause-of-payment failures or the initiation of DDoS attacks by overwhelming other nodes in the network with channel-opening requests. As a result, users will be discouraged from using the LN; hence, the technology will become obsolete as individuals will not waste the time and power investment required for using this technology.
In this paper, we propose an innovative invitation model protocol (IMP) to improve the security and reliability of Lightning Network (LN) technology. The IMP works by establishing a unique ‘Club' within the LN that only admits nodes confirmed to be honest and not malicious, thereby enhancing the network's overall security and reliability. Unlike existing research, this paper is the first of its kind that proposes extra metrics for nodes before joining or establishing an LN, which is especially important for trustless networks. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: materials and methods are discussed next, followed by simulation and results in 
Section 3
; finally, conclusions and future work are discussed in

CNTs/Fe-BTC composite materials were synthesized with the one-step solvothermal method. MWCNTs and SWCNTs were incorporated in situ during synthesis. The composite materials were characterized by different analytical techniques and used in the CO
2
-photocatalytic reduction to value-added products and clean fuels. In the incorporation of CNTs into Fe-BTC, better physical–chemical and optical properties were observed compared to Fe-BTC pristine. SEM images showed that CNTs were incorporated into the porous structure of Fe-BTC, indicating the synergy between them. Fe-BTC pristine showed to be selective to ethanol and methanol; although, it was more selective to ethanol. However, the incorporation of small amounts of CNTs into Fe-BTC not only showed higher production rates but changes in the selectivity compared with the Fe-BTC pristine were also observed. It is important to mention that the incorporation of CNTs into MOF Fe-BTC allowed for increasing the mobility of electrons, decreasing the recombination of charge carriers (electron/hole), and increasing the photocatalytic activity. In both reaction systems (batch and continuous), composite materials showed to be selective towards methanol and ethanol; however, in the continuous system, lower production rates were observed due to the decrease in the residence time compared to the batch system. Therefore, these composite materials are very promising systems to convert CO
2
 to clean fuels that could replace fossil fuels soon.


 
















 
Graphical Abstract












 


Approximately 85% of the world's primary energy is supplied from fossil fuels (oil, coal, etc); however, it is expected that in the near future, the use of these will be limited by the emission controls that have been agreed upon by the United National Organization (ONU). The combustion of fossil fuels (oils, carbon, etc.) emits large amounts of greenhouse gases such as CO
2
, NO
x
, and SO
x
, among others [
1
,
2
]. However, carbon dioxide (CO
2
) is the one that is emitted to the greatest extent into the atmosphere, and it is the main one responsible for the global warming of the planet that is generating serious consequences such as severe weather changes, melting of the poles, desertification of forests, etc. [
3
].
Currently, several processes are being investigated to reduce the concentration of CO
2
 in the atmosphere such as absorption in amines [
4
,
5
], capture using solid materials as adsorbents [
6
,
7
,
8
,
9
], and, very recently, its conversion to value-added products (formic acid, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde, among others) and clean fuels (hydrogen, methane, methanol, ethanol, etc.) through the photocatalytic reduction reaction of CO
2
 [
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
]. The CO
2
-photocatalytic reduction reaction is a process that allows CO
2
 to be converted to value-added products and clean fuels through the use of a photocatalyst and light in the visible or ultraviolet region [
15
,
16
]. This process is extremely interesting since it simulates the natural photosynthesis of plants [
17
]. However, the conversion of carbon dioxide is a very difficult process since it is a linear molecule and very stable, with a C=O binding energy of 750 kJ/mol, which is higher than that of C-C (336 kJ/mol), C-O (327 kJ/mol), and C-H (411 kJ/mol), which implies that large amounts of energy are necessary for it to react with other compounds. In addition, to reduce the CO
2
 molecule to CO
2
−
, a reduction potential of −1.9 eV is necessary [
11
,
18
].
Actually, several catalysts (ZnMn
2
O
4
, ZIFs, Co
3
O
4
, and Zn
2
GeO
4
, among others) are being studied in the CO
2
-photocatalytic reduction reaction [
19
,
20
,
21
]; however, the production rate towards value-added products and clean fuels is still very slow. For this reason, it is necessary to search for other materials that allow obtaining a better production rate, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are hybrid organic–inorganic structures made up of metal ions or clusters and multidentate organic bonds connected to metal nodes in one, two, or three dimensions, in which divalent or trivalent carboxylic acids are usually used to form structures with zinc, chromium, copper, aluminum, and zirconium, among others [
22
]. These materials have been rapidly developed in recent years due to the variety of their structures, as well as their easy adaptation and different applications such as catalysis, separation, gas storage, carbon dioxide capture, controlled drug release, luminescence, dye photocatalytic degradation, CO
2
-photocatalytic reduction, etc. [
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
,
28
].
MOFs have not only been shown to have a high surface area and controllable porosity but also have demonstrated excellent photocatalytic properties [
29
]. The latest studies have been focused on modifying the synthesis method mainly by green methods (hydrothermal, microwave, mechanochemical, etc.), or change in the band gap through the incorporation of metals, metal oxides, combination of organic ligands and metallic clusters, and carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [
30
,
31
,
32
,
33
].
The MOF Fe-benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Fe-BTC) is made up of Fe
3+
 ions and BTC linkers. Its composition is expressed by the C
9
H
3
FeO
6
 empirical formula and its mass content of iron and carbon is 21% and 41%, respectively. The structure of Fe-BTC is not well known due to its poor crystallinity, which is described in the literature as a disordered material or semi-amorphous [
34
,
35
]. This MOF has been studied in the separation of organic compounds in the liquid phase, oxidation reactions, dye adsorption, gases separation/adsorption, sensing, As(III) oxidation/adsorption process, and dye photocatalytic degradation, among other applications [
36
,
37
,
38
,
39
,
40
]. Our group has studied this material as an adsorbent in heavy metals, dye and drug adsorption, etc. [
29
,
41
,
42
].
CNTs can be used as photosensitizers or band gap modifiers. Furthermore, due to their excellent optical and electron transfer properties, carbonaceous materials have been extensively studied to improve the photoactivity of some semiconductors [
43
,
44
,
45
]. Several investigations have demonstrated that the incorporation of CNTs into MOFs can improve the physicochemical and optical properties of MOF pristine. Lin et al. [
46
] showed that the incorporation of CNTs into MOF UiO-66 (Zr) not only significantly improved the adsorption capacity for acid dyes but also enabled these UiO-66 derivatives to exhibit photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Other recent research demonstrated that the addition of CNTs to MOF-808 significantly improved the photocatalytic activity in the treatment of pharmaceutical and agrochemical wastewaters [
47
].
In the present work, CNTs/Fe-BTC composite materials were synthetized with the one-step solvothermal method, where CNTs were added during the synthesis process. The composite materials synthetized were characterized by different analytical techniques and evaluated in the CO
2
-photocatalytic reduction reaction using two reaction systems (batch and continuous) under visible or UV irradiation and mild reaction conditions (room temperature and pressure).
Figure 1
 shows the power X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) of MOF Fe-BTC pristine and composite materials. In the PXRD of Fe-BTC pristine, broad peaks were observed at 2θ = 10.54, 18.89, and 23.91º—characteristics of MOF Fe-BTC, according to the literature [
26
,
27
]. These same peaks were observed in both series of the composite materials, indicating that the incorporation of CNTs does not modify the structure of the MOF. Due to the small amount of CNTs added to the composite materials, peaks were not shown in the diffraction patterns observed.
The Raman analysis was used for determining the presence of the CNTs in the composite materials. In the Raman spectra of the composite materials, bands corresponding to CNTs and the organic ligand of MOF were mainly observed. Raman spectra of the MOF Fe-BTC pristine and composite materials are shown in 
Figure 2
. In the case of the Fe-BTC spectrum, it can be divided into two zones: the first in the range of 1750–700 cm
−1
, which shows bands characteristic of the vibrations corresponding to the organic ligand, and the second zone is in the range of 700–400 cm
−1
, corresponding to the vibrations of the secondary basic units or SBUs (metal cluster) and the interaction between the SBUs and organic ligands [
26
,
42
]. Additionally, other bands at 1377, 1608, and 2693 cm
−1
 were observed in the composite materials, corresponding to carbon nanotubes. The bands at 1377 and 1608 cm
−1
 are characteristics of the D band (disorder) and G band (graphite), respectively. The band at 2693 cm
−1
 corresponds to the 2D band (second-order harmonic). Thus, the presence of these three bands indicates the presence of CNTs in the composite materials.
Figure 3
 shows the FTIR spectra of the Fe-BTC and composite materials. All materials' FTIR spectra showed a broad band between 2700 and 3600 cm
−1
, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the O-H bond from the water molecules absorbed in the pores of the MOF [
48
]. Additionally, FTIR spectra are observed as the characteristic bands of the organic ligand and metallic clusters. For example, bands at 1447, 1564 y 1622 cm
−1
 are characteristics of the C=C vibrational group of the benzenic ring of trimesic acid. Additionally, other vibrational bands are observed between 1300 and 400 cm
−1
, which are attributed to symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylate group (C-O). Finally, it is possible observed bands at 488 and 616 cm
−1
 are characteristics of the interaction between the organic ligand and metallic cluster (O
2
-Fe) [
49
].
To understand the distribution of each component and clarify the dispersion state of the carbon nanotubes in the composite materials, FE-SEM characterization has been carried out on the 1.5% MWCNT/Fe-BTC and 1.5% SWCNT/Fe-BTC samples, as can be observed in 
Figure 4
. In both composite systems, the typical morphology of Fe-BTC can be observed (
Figure S1
), which consists of irregular particles with sizes in the range of micrometers (
Figure 4
A,C) [
35
]. More interestingly, at higher magnifications (
Figure 4
D–E and 
Figure 5
B), it is observed that the CNTs have been adequately incorporated into the matrix of the MOF (
Figure S2
). This fact allows us to infer that the incorporation process of both MWCNTs and SWCNTs generates the appearance of a synergy between CNTs and the MOF matrix.
Figure 5
 shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of both series. All the materials showed a broad absorption band from 250 to 350 nm, characteristic of π–π* transitions of the organic ligands [
50
]; another absorption band for all samples in the visible region (380–700 nm) was observed, which can be ascribed to the spin-allowed d–d electronic transitions of the trivalent metal ions (Fe
3+
). The band gap of the materials was obtained using the Tauc equation (
Table 1
 and 
Figure S3
). As can be seen in 
Table 1
, all materials are capable of absorbing photons with energies in the visible region. The incorporation of MWCNT in MOF Fe-BTC shows a decrease in the band gap due to the intimate interaction between them (
Table 1
). Whereas, for the SWCNT series, very small changes in the band gap were observed by increasing the percentage of carbon nanotubes. Other authors observed this same behavior; for example, Samy et al. [
47
] showed that the addition of CNTs to MOF-808 reduced the band gap, resulting in higher photocatalytic performance in the treatment of pharmaceutical and agrochemical wastewaters.
Narayanan et al. [

 molecule with the semiconductor surface through oxygen or carbon atoms modifies the degree of reactivity in the molecule through surface reactions, this being a key step in some chemical reactions. For example, a fundamental step in the CO

This study analyzes the transmission of market uncertainty on key European financial markets and the cryptocurrency market over an extended period, encompassing the pre-, during, and post-pandemic periods. Daily financial market indices and price observations are used to assess the forecasting models. We compare statistical, machine learning, and deep learning forecasting models to evaluate the financial markets, such as the ARIMA, hybrid ETS-ANN, and 
k
NN predictive models. The study results indicate that predicting financial market fluctuations is challenging, and the accuracy levels are generally low in several instances. ARIMA and hybrid ETS-ANN models perform better over extended periods compared to the 
k
NN model, with ARIMA being the best-performing model in 2018–2021 and the hybrid ETS-ANN model being the best-performing model in most of the other subperiods. Still, the 
k
NN model outperforms the others in several periods, depending on the observed accuracy measure. Researchers have advocated using parametric and non-parametric modeling combinations to generate better results. In this study, the results suggest that the hybrid ETS-ANN model is the best-performing model despite its moderate level of accuracy. Thus, the hybrid ETS-ANN model is a promising financial time series forecasting approach. The findings offer financial analysts an additional source that can provide valuable insights for investment decisions.


 










 


The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant economic impact that has intensified market risk aversion to a degree that has not been observed since the global financial crisis. During this period, financial markets worldwide have experienced a significant decline since January 2020. This disruption has resulted in highly high fluctuations and unpredictability. Despite the ongoing pandemic and its indeterminate long-term effects, the U.S. government has recently declared an end to the pandemic [
1
], likely due to the transition to the endemic stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, characterized by the virus's widespread presence but significantly reduced fatalities compared to 2020 [
2
]. According to a study conducted by [
3
], there is an adverse correlation between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the U.S. stock market returns. The study further found that stock markets responded reasonably quickly to the increase in confirmed cases rather than deaths. Therefore, the impact of the crisis on financial markets and the broader economic environment, including consumer behavior and intentions, has been a topic of concern among many scholars [
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
]. From this standpoint, asset management has become crucial for organizations seeking to optimize their asset utilization and maximize returns in challenging conditions and volatile markets.
The ongoing pandemic and its consequential impact on financial markets have already elicited significant scholarly attention. In the near future, this outbreak is expected to serve as a standard for comparison, exceeding the level of interest observed during previous crises of similar nature. Developing models that yield accurate stock market fluctuation predictions is fundamental to improving the informational base, meeting the investor's goals and return expectations, and accommodating risk tolerance over a specified investment period. This is because asset allocation is a strategic approach that seeks to attain an equilibrium between risk and return by adjusting the proportion of each asset in a portfolio. Despite this exercise's significance for risk management predictions, only a few prior studies (see [
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
]) have focused on the European stock market and attempted to estimate the key financial markets' volatility. At the same time, the financial markets literature on forecasting cryptocurrencies, U.S. stock, and commodity market volatility is more mature; refer, for example, to recent academic research by [

,

,
13
,
14
,

,
16
,
17
]), which has made predictions regarding significant incidents, such as COVID-19 and its economic consequences, while also examining the impact of past pandemics.
Therefore, this study aims to address the discrepancy in the literature on forecasting market fluctuations by examining the European stock market indices. The availability of financial market information has increased, strengthening the correlation between market distribution and other factors. Over the past decades, a significant body of research has grown on forecasting time series using various linear, nonlinear, and hybrid linear-nonlinear models. In this study, we employed the application of traditional statistical models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [
18
], as well as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) and hybrid forecasting models, i.e., the ETS-ANN model [
19
] to evaluate the volatility of the European stock markets. The European stock market encompasses a wide range of stock exchanges, including major ones, such as the London Stock Exchange (LTSE), Euronext (N100), Deutsche Börse (GDAXI), the French stock market (FCHI), and the Swiss Stock Exchange (SSMI).
This study contributes twofold to the expanding body of literature in the field. First, it examines the distribution of fluctuations between the European stock market and cryptocurrency in three subperiods: before, during, and ongoing the COVID-19 outbreak. We chose to examine the European stock market because the COVID-19 pandemic has, from one side, severely impacted each European country. Still, on the other side, each government has imposed diverse restrictions within various time frames. For the financial markets, the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a systematic risk factor. In this context, government-imposed restrictions on spreading the virus could not prevent the negative consequences of the financial stock markets' trajectory [
3
]. However, observing the cryptocurrency market, we picture a different likelihood (see, 
Figure 1
). Hence, examining the correlation between the European stock market and the cryptocurrency markets during this period is critical. This analysis of the cross-market relationships offers valuable information for financial market players concerning financial risk management. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency with the highest capitalization and it serves as a benchmark for investors and academics. Hence, any disruptions in this market may also have ripple effects on the global financial market. Second, exploring various forecasting models, such as statistical, ML, DL, and hybrid models, we examine the dynamics of market distribution to provide an understanding of the market predictability among the European stock markets and Bitcoin during the COVID-19 pandemic through an analysis of daily data.
Our results show that predicting BTC-USD distributions is challenging, and the accuracy levels are generally low, especially in 2018 and 2019. GDAXI is more predictive than BTC-USD, and the ETS-ANN and 
k
NN models perform both in different subperiods. The ARIMA and ETS-ANN models perform better than the 
k
NN model for predicting the FTSE index's performance, but their performances were generally weak in 2018–2021 and 2020. ARIMA and ETS-ANN models perform better over extended periods than the 
k
NN model, with ARIMA being the best-performing model in 2018–2021 and the hybrid ETS-ANN model in 2020. The hybrid ETS-ANN model shows significant potential for forecasting financial time series in this context.
The subsequent sections of the document are organized as follows: 
Section 2
 provides a short review of the literature on financial market forecasts through machine learning techniques. 
Section 3
 discusses the data collection and modeling methodologies. 
Section 4
 compares the different models' accuracy measures and outcomes. The article concludes with the fifth section, including future research suggestions.
Numerous unforeseen and rare events, called black swan events, significantly impact the stock market. A growing body of scholarly literature has examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market, mainly concentrating on the US market, and observed how stock and cryptocurrency markets reacted to various global events; for example, see ([

,
16
,
17
,
20
,
21
,
22
]). Ref. [
13
] conducted a study to examine the influence of COVID-19 on the relationship between return and risk through a quantile regression methodology. Ref. [
23
] reported that the confirmed COVID-19 cases' daily growth rate and the total number of associated deaths significantly impacted the stock returns in the Chinese stock markets. Furthermore, there is a contention that the scale of the impact of disease epidemics has been comparatively less substantial than that of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ref. [
24
] performed an event study to assess the instantaneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 21 stock indices in countries significantly affected by the outbreak. The results indicate that the stock market's reaction was swift, leading to an immediate decrease, with Asian stock markets demonstrating higher negative abnormal returns than other countries. Another study used the wavelet approach to investigate the multiscale co-movement between Bitcoin and COVID-19 deaths [
14
].
This study centers on the pandemic period and the corresponding impact on key European financial markets compared to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin. In recent literature, one of the first studies [
8
] assessed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on eight European stock markets. They utilized multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) to calculate the Hurst exponents. Their findings validate the presence of multifractal characteristics in the European stock markets amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the efficiency levels of these markets differ based on their multifractal properties. For example, the efficiency of the Spanish stock market is comparatively higher than that of Austria, which exhibits a relatively lower efficiency. Belgium, Italy, and Germany are positioned within the intermediate range. In a recent study, Ref. [
11
] examined the accuracy of machine learning and deep learning techniques in forecasting the FCHI 40 index during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study aimed to determine whether the index and individual prices would maintain the steady growth they attained at the start of the vaccination administration. The authors used 
k
NN and LSTM and assessed their performances compared to the ARIMA time series model. Their findings identified that the 
k
NN technique outperformed LSTM and ARIMA. Ref. [
10
] examined the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the return dynamics of 10 European stock markets before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their results were unexpectedly positive, as they observed a swift and unparalleled recovery in the European stock market, resulting in notable yield gains after the COVID-19 outbreak. In another study, Ref. [
9
] employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to examine 21 potential internal and external shocks to the European financial market during the COVID-19 outbreak. They found Germany and France to be the most critical determinants of the European market.
This study evaluated daily prices for the BTC-USD (data are publicly available at 
https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/data/
 (accessed on 22 January 2023) for the cryptocurrency in the EDT time zone) and the European financial markets FCHI, GDAXI, FTSE, SSMI, and N100 indices. The daily price dataset was obtained from Yahoo Finance (
finance.yahoo.com
, (accessed on 22 January 2023)) for the period that ranges from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021. To forecast the index fluctuations and evaluate the various models, we divided the sample dataset into three subperiods: (i) the pre-COVID period that ranges from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019; (ii) the main COVID period that ranges from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020; and (iii) the ongoing COVID-19 period ranges from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. We split the dataset into two segments for each subperiod: a training set and a test set to assess the model's forecasting performance, following a ratio of 80:20. To evaluate the study's models, stationary data are required; hence, we computed the log returns and ran the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) tests to test the unit root null hypothesis. Finally, the Jarque–Bera test will define whether or not the financial asset dataset has skewness and kurtosis corresponding to a normal distribution.
Figure 1
 illustrates the daily close price and returns the trajectory of the financial market indices dataset. We initially noticed both substantial increasing and downward tendencies. Thus, we observed a noticeable sudden shift when the World Health Organization (WHO) denoted COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, in all financial market indices, but significantly less for the BTC market. Consequently, the fat tails and volatility clustering are more significant during the pandemic than during the remaining period, which follows a similar pattern. In addition, we observed that in most of the examined indices, the stock prices returned to their pre-crash levels following a brief period of market disruption during the trading days of the financial market crash. However, in most instances, the increase is developing moderately, except for the GDAXI index, which reacted positively and swiftly following a few trading days. After a bear market, the market has shown evidence of a sharp recovery. As a result, we experienced a momentum shift in market conditions as the market returned to upward movement",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Ampountolas,Apostolos Ampountolas",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/forecasting/forecasting-05-00026/article_deploy/html/images/forecasting-05-00026-g001-550.jpg?1687256611,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,6.275949,2ab742d4cf5895da3bb9a6850e72e9d5

For beginners looking to enter the market, understanding the basics of Bitcoin Gold and its potential as an investment is crucial. This article explores the viability of Bitcoin Gold as a good investment choice for beginners, delving into its technology and tips for beginners. Make sure you take all security measures into consideration to secure your investments. Moreover, try using secured automated trading bots like Quantum Hancock to ease up the trading process.

Understanding the Technology Behind Bitcoin Gold

To fully grasp the potential of Bitcoin Gold as an investment, it is essential to delve into the underlying technology that powers it. Bitcoin Gold is built on the foundation of blockchain technology, which serves as a decentralized ledger for recording and verifying transactions.

At its core, blockchain technology eliminates the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government, to oversee transactions. Instead, it relies on a network of computers, known as nodes, to validate and store transaction data. This decentralized nature ensures transparency, security, and immutability within the Bitcoin Gold ecosystem.

One of the key aspects that differentiate Bitcoin Gold from its predecessor, Bitcoin, is its mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold utilizes the Equihash algorithm, which is designed to be resistant to specialized mining hardware called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). This shift aims to democratize the mining process and make it more accessible to a wider range of participants, including individual miners using standard consumer-grade hardware.

The mining process in Bitcoin Gold involves solving complex mathematical puzzles, known as proof-of-work, to add new blocks to the blockchain. Miners compete to solve these puzzles, and the first one to find a valid solution is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin Gold coins.

Additionally, Bitcoin Gold employs a process called ""hard forking"" to create a separate blockchain from the original Bitcoin network. This hard fork was implemented to address concerns regarding centralization and to offer a more egalitarian mining experience. As a result, Bitcoin Gold operates independently from Bitcoin, with its own distinct features and community.

By understanding the underlying technology of Bitcoin Gold, investors can gain insights into its potential for scalability, security, and long-term viability. It is important to consider the implications of the Equihash algorithm, as it aims to level the playing field for miners and foster a decentralized network.

Tips for Beginner Investors Considering Bitcoin Gold

Before investing in Bitcoin Gold, it is important to set realistic expectations and define your investment goals. Understand that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically. Bitcoin Gold, like other cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant price swings in the past. Therefore, it is important to be prepared for potential ups and downs and avoid investing more than you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin Gold is often seen as a long-term investment due to its potential for growth over time. It is advisable to develop a well-defined investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider factors such as your investment horizon, diversification, and periodic review of your portfolio to make informed decisions regarding your Bitcoin Gold holdings.

While Bitcoin Gold may show promise, it is prudent not to put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is key to mitigating risks in any investment portfolio. Consider allocating a portion of your investment funds to other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets to spread risk. By diversifying, you can potentially offset any negative impact of a decline in the value of Bitcoin Gold.

Selecting a reliable and reputable cryptocurrency exchange or platform is vital for investing in Bitcoin Gold. Look for platforms that offer robust security measures, such as two-factor authentication and cold storage of funds. User experience, ease of use, and customer support are also essential considerations. Additionally, research the trading fees associated with the platform, as high fees can eat into your investment returns over time.

The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and staying informed about the latest developments is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Follow reputable sources, join cryptocurrency communities, and engage in forums to gain insights from experienced investors. Conduct thorough research on Bitcoin Gold itself, its market trends, and any regulatory or technological advancements that may impact its value.

Conclusion

In conclusion, for beginners considering Bitcoin Gold as an investment, it is essential to approach it with caution and realistic expectations. By setting long-term goals, diversifying your portfolio, choosing a reputable platform, and staying informed through research, you can make informed investment decisions. Bitcoin Gold's potential for growth and its underlying technology make it an intriguing option, but thorough research and understanding of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market are crucial before making any investment commitments.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-06/28/pr_15215_32fcab04_image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.98199,95ed0706484154f9c26610763fc1d5d3

208,"Why Bitcoin's Price Has Rallied to More Than $30,000",Brenden Rearick,2023-06-29 00:00:00,date,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/money/why-bitcoins-price-is-rallying-june-2023,charlotteobserver.com,BlackRock and Fidelity both filed for spot bitcoin ETFs this month.,"***Money is not a client of any investment adviser featured on this page. The information provided on this page is for educational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Money does not offer advisory services.***

This year has been a litmus test for the crypto market as it determines whether it can bounce back from a dismal 2022.

In June, bitcoin's price hit its highest point of the year thus far, topping out at around $31,200 per coin. But on Friday, bitcoin's price dipped below $30,000 once again before recovering some of the losses.

Much of the volatility is being attributed by market watchers to news that more traditional financial firms are looking for ways to be involved in the crypto market. Investment companies BlackRock and Fidelity both filed for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this month, coinciding with the start of a bitcoin rally that brought the coin's price up by over $6,000 per coin.

But on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says those filings may not be adequate. Here's what investors need to know.

What is a spot bitcoin ETF?

Bitcoin futures ETFs are already on the market, so you may be wondering what the difference is between a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. Most simply, the difference is that a spot bitcoin ETF would directly follow the price of bitcoin, while bitcoin futures ETFs track the price of bitcoin futures contracts.

As Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School explains, futures ETFs operate less efficiently than spot ETFs because they expire, and companies must roll their positions from contract to contract. This creates price friction and added costs that can be avoided by spot ETFs.

Malekan says a spot ETF is likely what many bitcoin investors are really craving. Plenty of companies have tried to receive approval for spot bitcoin ETFs from the SEC. Asset manager Grayscale filed for one last year and, upon rejection, began a still-ongoing lawsuit against the agency for its ambiguity regarding the demands of a crypto spot fund.

Why has bitcoin's price been rallying?

BlackRock's status makes its filing seem different from those previous in investors' eyes, Malekan says.

'It's the biggest asset manager, and it has a successful track record in getting ETFs approved,' he says. 'There's a general perception that a company like BlackRock would not be doing this if they didn't think the regulatory environment in the U.S. was going to improve going forward.'

There's also the fact that the crypto industry dealt with a lot of uncertainty in the industry last year, stemming from events like the implosion of the major crypto exchange FTX or the collapse of TerraUSD, a 'stablecoin.'

Malekan says that uncertainty could be cooling down, which is helping bitcoin's price.

'People have been expecting the worst about a lot of things including the regulatory crackdown, which is happening,' Malekan says, referencing a recent lawsuit against Coinbase by the SEC as an example. 'Coinbase stock actually is now significantly higher than when the SEC revealed its lawsuit, and I think it's a case of the actual news being less bad than what was anticipated.'

Why did bitcoin's price dip Friday?

Investors who were confident in the near-term potential of a bitcoin spot ETF should probably hold their confidence, though. Just two weeks after BlackRock's filing, a Friday report by the Wall Street Journal said that the SEC has already decided that recent ETF filings — including BlackRock, Fidelity and others — remain inadequate for approval. Specifically, the Journal reports that the agency says that filings are not clear nor comprehensive enough — a complaint it has made in many of its rejections of spot bitcoin ETFs over the years.

On Friday morning, bitcoin prices dropped by more than $1,200 following the report before recovering some of the losses.",,2295,news,US,en,Brenden Rearick,https://rs.moneyresearchcollective.com/wp-assets/apwp/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/30111731/bfa759527e-scaled.jpeg,False,,7.939995,220e41d49dcdb7da0d0dce8f22662bdb

BULT's IP Portfolio will be integrated into all Bullet ATMs making it the first licensed Bitcoin ATM network of kiosks in North America. Bitcoin ATMs have experienced significant growth in the United States, driven by the increasing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions. According to
 the website 
CoinATM Radar
, there were nearly 31,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and nearly 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs in Canada as of the time of this release. BULT intends to license its IP Portfolio to other Bitcoin ATM operators and manufacturers in North America.
 
'We are excited to be one of the few publicly traded Bitcoin ATM companies with our anticipated roll out of our Bullet ATMs,' commented Simon Rubin, Chief Executive Officer. 'Bitcoin is a rapidly growing asset class, and we believe that our Bullet ATMs will provide a convenient and easy way for people to get involved. We believe that the Atlanta Georgia metropolitan area is a great market for Bullet ATMs. The city has a large and growing diverse population who are more likely to be interested in Bitcoin. We are confident that our Bullet ATMs will be well-received by the local community.'
 
Bitcoin ATMs allow users to conveniently buy and sell Bitcoin for cash using a free-standing kiosk similar in size to a traditional ATM machine. The process is simple and secure, and users can typically complete a transaction in minutes. These automated machines allow individuals to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash, providing a seamless bridge between traditional fiat currency and the world of digital assets. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, the future of Bitcoin ATMs in the United States appears promising.
 
Bitcoin ATMs are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a convenient way for people to access the Bitcoin market. As more people recognize the potential of Bitcoin and seek to participate in the Bitcoin market, the need for accessible on-ramps becomes crucial without relying on online brokers or exchanges. BULT's CEO, Simon Rubin, concluded: 'Bullet ATMs are a reasonable alternative to online exchanges and the accessibility makes Bullet ATMs an attractive option for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to the space.'

In the turbulent landscape of financial markets, Bitcoin has emerged as a significant focus for investors due to its highly volatile returns. However, the risks and uncertainties associated with it necessitate effective hedging strategies. This paper explores the potential of various financial assets, including interest rates, stock markets, commodities, and exchange rates, as dynamic hedges against Bitcoin's risk. Utilizing a DCC-GARCH model, we construct a dynamic hedging model to analyze the viability of these financial assets as hedges. The data is categorized into pre-pandemic and pandemic periods to assess any change in hedging performance due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Our empirical findings suggest that the dynamic DCC-GARCH model outperforms the static OLS model in this context. During the pandemic period, a diverse set of financial assets demonstrated enhanced efficiency in hedging Bitcoin risk compared to the pre-pandemic phase. Among the hedging commodities, stock market indices, the US dollar index, and commodity futures displayed superior performance.


 










 


The advent of Bitcoin dates back to 2008, with the inaugural Bitcoin block's genesis in 2009. The promotion and popularization of blockchain technology fostered the first public transaction, interchanging Bitcoin for physical goods, in May 2010. In July the same year, Tokyo-based online trading platform Mt. Gox emerged, becoming the pioneer in employing Bitcoin as a trading tool, with its value approximating US
$
0.08. The establishment of the maiden cryptocurrency exchange in July 2017 marked a significant surge in Bitcoin prices, albeit with inherent instability influenced by policy changes and market news. The notorious COVID-19 pandemic, commencing from October 2019, catalyzed considerable fluctuations in Bitcoin prices during 2020.
The pandemic instigated substantial morbidity and mortality globally, impelling governments to implement lockdown measures to curb viral spread. This enforced stasis critically hampered the global economy and supply chains, instigating market instability, evidenced by stock market downturns, futures liquidation, reduced demand for air travel, and an oil price war. These cascading effects incited investor panic, leading to sharp market variations. Governments responded with various relief and revitalization schemes, albeit unable to address the inflation and market instability issues, thereby exacerbating national government debt problems.
In 2020, the US Federal Reserve announced interest rate cuts and implemented an unlimited quantitative easing policy. The resulting overcirculation of money stimulated asset and commodity price surges, leading to global inflation. Subsequent tightening policy, designed to control inflation by raising interest rates and redirecting funds from risky assets back to the banking system, invited pessimistic economic outlooks from scholars.
In light of the evolving economic climate and market instability, exacerbated by COVID-19, investors turned towards innovative financial products such as Bitcoin to offset losses. As widely acknowledged by previous studies [
1
,
2
], Bitcoin presents a highly volatile investment opportunity, but this volatility also offers substantial speculative potential. As the pandemic unfolded, numerous investigations explored Bitcoin's role, analyzing its relationship with traditional financial markets [
3
,
4
,
5
] and its impact on market efficiency [
6
].
A closer examination of Bitcoin's trends in recent years, as depicted in 
Figure 1
, corroborates its inherent volatility and sensitivity, manifested through dramatic price fluctuations. In this context, Ederington (1979) seminal work highlighted the pronounced relevance of futures contracts as a hedge against market risk [
7
]. However, he pointed out that the efficacy of such a strategy could vary across different markets. This underscores the necessity of customizing risk management tactics to suit particular market dynamics.
Bitcoin's rapid ascent began in November 2020, quadrupling in a brief period. This growth trajectory took a pivotal turn on 7 September 2021, when El Salvador recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, a first in global history. Despite this significant advancement, Bitcoin's peak unit price at 
$
68,925 on 10 November 2021, brought a slew of challenges, such as high transaction prices, excessive volatility, and increased scrutiny from global regulators. These factors combined with negative market news led to a sharp plunge in Bitcoin prices, which dipped over 30% in just two months. The situation further worsened in 2022 when the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy, leading to a mass exodus of market speculators.
In the realm of the cryptocurrency market, significant price fluctuations amplify investment risks while accelerating market fund flows. Thus, adopting an active investment approach becomes essential for investors to mitigate losses in high-volatility markets and navigate the uncertainties associated with passivity. During dramatic market adjustments, stable assets such as gold, precious metals, government bonds, or the US dollar, which do not follow significant fluctuations, are often employed as hedging tools for investors seeking risk diversification.
Wijk (2013) demonstrated the impact of several financial assets like the US Dow Jones Index, the USD-Euro exchange rate, and oil prices on Bitcoin [
8
], highlighting potential avenues for hedging Bitcoin-related risks. Further, Dyhrberg (2016) and Klabbers (2017) established Bitcoin's hedging potential against the FTSE 100 Index, USD, and its role in diversifying portfolio risks [
9
,
10
]. Yet, Balcilar et al. (2017) and Wang et al. (2019) [
11
,
12
] emphasized the challenges in predicting Bitcoin prices due to its high volatility.
This study seeks to bridge the existing gap in literature pertaining to the hedging properties of Bitcoin during unprecedented crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to the conclusion drawn by Choi & Shin (2022), who dismissed Bitcoin as the 'new gold' for hedging during the pandemic [
13
], our perspective posits Bitcoin not as a hedging asset but as an investment tool. With the escalating interest in cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin's risks and the development of suitable hedging strategies are of paramount importance for investors.
Our study centers on Bitcoin due to its prominent role in the cryptocurrency market. We investigate potential financial assets that may act as effective hedges against Bitcoin's volatility. To this end, we utilize the DCC-GARCH model to scrutinize the correlation between Bitcoin and these assets, both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective is to illuminate how the hedging value of these assets against Bitcoin's volatility risk may have altered amidst the turmoil of the pandemic. By offering an empirical analysis that acknowledges both the currency-like and asset-like characteristics of cryptocurrencies, our study enriches the current body of literature and provides critical insights for market participants and policymakers.
The DCC-GARCH model is integral to our methodology as we apply it to probe the correlation between Bitcoin and the aforementioned financial assets. Our chief aim is to analyze and compare the hedging ratio of these assets pre- and post-COVID-19. This comparative analysis is intended to reveal if and how the hedging value of these assets against Bitcoin's volatility risk evolved during the upheaval triggered by the pandemic.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2
 describes the data while 
Section 3
 introduces the econometric model used in the study. 
Section 4
 discusses the empirical findings. 
Section 5
 presents the conclusions by summarizing our primary findings and insights. Lastly, 
Section 6
 provides a discussion on the limitations of our study and outlines potential directions for future research.
The variables collected in this study include eight items, namely the weekly closing prices of Bitcoin (BTC), the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield (TNX), the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG), the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC), the Standard & Poor's 500 Volatility Index (VIX), West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures (WTI), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange gold futures (GC), and the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX). The sample period was from 15 September 2014 to 31 July 2022, with a total of 411 weekly data points obtained from Yahoo! Finance. Given that the World Health Organization recognized the virus in early 2020, but research on the epidemic indicates that COVID-19 began to spread in human society from October to November 2019, this paper uses the end of October 2019 as the boundary to observe the structure and changes of variables in two sub-periods, before and after the occurrence of the epidemic.
The decision to use weekly data instead of daily data for our GARCH models is supported by several key considerations that we should have elaborated on in our original manuscript. Firstly, the volatility of Bitcoin and other financial assets can be quite high on a day-to-day basis. Weekly data helps smooth out some of this volatility and provide a more extended view of trends in the data, a beneficial approach when considering Bitcoin as a potential hedging instrument. Secondly, while daily data provides more granular detail, it can often introduce noise into the model. This noise, arising from non-market factors such as individual investor behavior, rumors, or news events, may not significantly impact the longer-term trend. Weekly data helps mitigate some of these short-term fluctuations and focuses on underlying patterns and relationships. Lastly, unlike traditional financial markets, Bitcoin markets operate 24/7. Continuous trading can sometimes lead to anomalies in daily data due to factors such as low liquidity during certain times. Using weekly data helps overcome this problem, as it considers the aggregated effect over the week, thereby reducing the impact of such anomalies.
To increase the diversification of Bitcoin hedging performance and spread risk, comparative hedging was carried out with financial assets that correspond to or are relatively representative of each market. Representative commodities in each market and Bitcoin were included in the hedging portfolio. The reasons for selecting the variables are described as follows. First, the yield of the ten-year US Treasury note (TNX) reflects market expectations of inflation and Federal Reserve policy, and is also an important indicator of investor expectations of corporate earnings. Secondly, this paper chooses three hedging targets related to the stock market, namely Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG), Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC), and Standard & Poor's 500 Volatility Index (VIX). Considering the cost of investor funds, this paper chooses Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG) as the stock market hedging target with low investment threshold and tracking error less than 0.04%. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) uses all listed companies on the NASDAQ weighted by market capitalization, which also reflects the situation of the US stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500 Volatility Index (VIX) is an index of market volatility in the Chicago Options Exchange, representing the implied volatility of the S&P 500 Index in the next month, reflecting the confidence of the investing public in the economic outlook during that period. The value of VIX is positively related to investors' expected volatility in the stock market, and it is also known as the 'panic index'.
For commodity markets, the focus is on the most active trading of WTI crude oil futures and gold futures (GC). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is commonly used in the production of gasoline and fuel, and is one of the indispensable raw materials in daily life. Its spot and futures prices are also representative of the scale. The Commodity Exchange (COMEX) gold futures are an important means of hedging and value preservation against market uncertainty and inflation, and are often included in discussions on hedging issues. Finally, the US Dollar Index (USDX) in the foreign exchange market is selected as the hedging target. The US dollar is the main settlement currency for global commodity trade, and exchange rates are extremely important. The US Dollar Index is a number obtained by weighting the exchange rate between the US dollar and other currencies, and the value of the US Dollar Index can observe the trend of the US dollar against world currencies.
Table 1
 and 
Table 2
 provide descriptive statistics of the original prices and rates of change before and during the pandemic, respectively. Observing both tables in conjunction, it is clear that the VIX index, a measure of market sentiment, has the largest standard deviation. This value exceeds 17 in both the pre- and post-pandemic periods, indicating significant volatility in investor sentiment throughout the sample period. A closer look at the VIX values reveals that the maximum VIX reached 66.04 after the outbreak of COVID-19, significantly higher than the pre-outbreak maximum of 30.11. This significant increase highlights the heightened sense of fear and uncertainty in the financial market during the pandemic. The standard deviation of BTC, both before and during the pandemic, was also significantly higher than other assets, reaching 10.6828 and 9.9314, respectively. Furthermore, BTC had the highest average return among all assets, with 1.1769 and 0.6482 before and during the pandemic, respectively. As shown in

The Home Minister's statement comes in view of Bengaluru City Police Commissioner B Dayananda recommending to the government to hand over the bitcoin hacking case of 2020 to a special investigating agency as the involvement of an international gang is suspected.
 
'We have written to the DG&IGP seeking an investigation by a special investigation agency. The decision in this regard will be taken by the government. The case was registered in the city in 2020.

The bitcoin scam came to light in 2020 when BJP was in power. In November 2020, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Bengaluru City Police secured 28-year-old Srikrishna Ramesh, alias Sriki of Jayanagar and seized 500gm of hydro ganja. A case was registered against him under the NDPS Act. During interrogation, he is alleged to have confessed that he is involved in the alleged hacking of several exchanges and acquiring bitcoins. After his arrest, two more cases were registered against him.
 
The gang reportedly led by Sriki was involved in the hacking of the e-procurement portal of the centre for e-governance of the state government and allegedly siphoning off nearly Rs 11.5 crore. After Sriki was released on bail, his whereabouts are not known to police. There were allegations of alleged involvement of some politicians and officers in the case. Congress had sought a probe into the case monitored by a Supreme Court judge.

Illicit Crypto Ecosystem Report
, a detailed guide to the complex dynamics of crypto crime. The new report identifies over 40 types of criminal activity, and reveals that a seismic shift in crypto crime has begun – moving away from the Bitcoin blockchain on to a diverse array of other chains like Ethereum, Tron, Binance Smart Chain and more. Notably, TRM's analysis showed that Bitcoin accounts for only 19% of illicit crypto volume today, as criminals look to new blockchains and tactics, like 'chain-hopping' to launder money and evade detection.
 
The Illicit Crypto Ecosystem Report is delivered by TRM Labs' specialized threat intelligence team that monitors and reports on the latest risks, synthesizing trillions of disparate data points into a clear view of the crypto crime landscape. The report examines everything from espionage to SIM swapping and pump and dump schemes. This holistic view provides a powerful resource for law enforcement and compliance professionals who need a comprehensive yet granular view of where to allocate investigation and technological resources.
 
Key findings of TRM Labs' Illicit Crypto Ecosystem Report, which analyzed data from the full year 2022 include:
 
Crypto crime has moved beyond Bitcoin
 
In 2016, Bitcoin accounted for 97% of total illicit crypto volume. In 2022, Bitcoin accounted for just 19%.
In 2016, two-thirds of crypto hack volume was on Bitcoin; in 2022, Bitcoin accounted for just under 3%, with Ethereum (68%) and Binance Smart Chain (19%) dominating the field.
Bitcoin was the exclusive currency for terrorist financing in 2016, but analysis shows it was all but replaced by assets on the TRON blockchain, which accounted for 92% in 2022.
 
Additional flow of funds findings
 
Approximately USD 9.04 billion was sent to various types of fraud schemes in 2022, with the large majority going to apparent Ponzi and/or pyramid schemes.
Approximately USD 2 billion was stolen in 2022 through attacks on cross-chain bridges, which enable cryptocurrency to pass from one blockchain to another.
As much as USD 1.49 billion was spent on Darknet markets (DNMs) in 2022, over 80% of which was spent on Russian-language DNMs.
 
'A sea change in illicit crypto activity is underway, and TRM is empowering everyone from law enforcement investigators to compliance professionals to disrupt this new era of crypto crime,' said Esteban Castaño, co-founder and CEO, TRM Labs. 'The shift away from the Bitcoin blockchain on to other blockchains and tactics underscores the importance of our building the industry's most comprehensive map of illicit financial flows on-chain. Investigators choose TRM because no matter how sophisticated the attempt to obfuscate the flow of funds, our blockchain intelligence platform allows them to follow the money and close cases.'

filing.



'BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's statement that bitcoin is an 'international asset' that can help give clients a better future signals a new chapter for bitcoin where it is embraced by the most established and trusted names in global finance. Bitcoin is entirely independent from any one currency or economy which makes it a uniquely attractive store of value, particularly under the conditions of geopolitical conflict and inflationary anxieties we are seeing now.

As the leading cryptocurrency with no ties or affiliation to any government, bitcoin occupies a singular role as a safe haven asset amid uncertain market conditions. Now more than ever, bitcoin is being recognized by financial leaders like BlackRock as a resilient, long-term store of value and a form of 'digitized gold' that can serve as a hedge against market downturns.

As global institutions continue to show their faith in bitcoin as a preferred store of value, we will see bitcoin rise to unprecedented levels of mainstream adoption and demand. bitcoin etf filings from global leaders like BlackRock and Fidelity will also continue to catalyze a race among other financial institutions to offer bitcoin-based financial products and meet rising client demand.'",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-07/06/V_debf1image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,9.240055,9aff46be7ae102d333f5828f792c8cff

BlackRock filed with the U.S. securities and exchange commission (SEC) to approve the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on June 15, 2023.

The question remains, however, as to whether the SEC will make a decision promptly or whether it will become a legal issue.

Consequently, the price sentiment of crypto assets is mainly dependent on the US SEC's decision, and any delay could likely dampen the momentum, resulting in a Bitcoin price decline.

The fact that financial titans such as Valkyrie, Fidelity, Bitwise, Invesco, and WisdomTree filed for ETFs after BlackRock gives traders reason to believe that there is more to the filings than meets the eye.

In this context, Bitcoin analysts anticipate a period of flat asset prices in the third quarter, followed by a crypto bull run by the end of the year.

In addition to the Bitcoin etf filings , enthusiasts of digital assets are anticipating the Bitcoin halving event, which is scheduled for the end of April 2024.

In 2015, according to the office, Bachiashvili engaged in Bitcoin mining with an investor who anticipated a proportional profit distribution.

Bachiashvili allegedly generated a profit of 8,253.13 BTC in 2017, which was worth approximately $39 million at the time, but neglected to pay the appropriate amount to the investor.

At the time of writing, Bachiashvili's alleged BTC earnings are worth close to $250 million based on Bitcoin's current price of approximately $30,000. The office also alleged that Bachiashvili concealed the details of the stolen cryptocurrency to transfer the funds to multiple wallets and use the funds for financial operations.

Robert Amsterdam, the founding partner of Amsterdam & Partners LLP, which represents Bachiashvili, issued a statement in which he asserted that the charges are'not based on any factual findings or serious investigation' but are'politically motivated.'

According to Amsterdam, the fees are detrimental to the rule of . The attorney emphasized their intention to combat the accusations and uncover the truth.

In the press release, the attorney also stated that the state apparatus is being'misused as a tool for theft' and that Bachiashvili is being targeted solely due to his political beliefs.

This study employs continuous wavelet transforms to model the relationship between Bitcoin volume and prices across time and frequency space using daily data for the period between 17 September 2014 and 10 April 2023. The results show that Bitcoin price and volume have a long-term relationship at low frequency cycles mostly during the period after 2019. A statistically insignificant relationship between the price and volume of Bitcoin is observed prior to 2019 which coincides with a time of limited regulatory oversight of Bitcoin markets globally. Positive correlation is observed in the aftermath of this period, with stronger correlation recorded during and post the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the findings reveal that fluc-tuations in the Bitcoin volume tends to affect the price at higher frequency synchronizations (short-term); whereas, at lower frequencies (long-term), a feedback loop is observed, whereby the price changes lead to alterations in the volume.

Currently in its presale phase, hopes are high that ALEX will hit the market with a bang, making the sort of headline-grabbing moves that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has recorded lately.

The recent surge in price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community. The Proof of Work cryptocurrency is up 160% over the past month. At the same time, interest in another digital asset that has yet to debut, Alex The Doge (ALEX), has been ramping up.

Alex The Doge (ALEX) is a unique project that combines the appeal of memecoins with the utility of decentralized finance (DeFi) and play-to-earn gaming. Its presale phase, during which early supporters can acquire ALEX tokens ahead of the token's DEX launch, has generated strong interest that augurs well for the project's prospects.

Alex The Doge aims to revolutionize the gaming industry by creating a digital gaming world called the Miracle Verse. This ecosystem will enable users to engage in play-to-earn gaming, social trading, and DeFi activities.

Built on the Polygon blockchain for scalability and security, Alex The Doge (ALEX) has positioned itself as a promising GameFi player in the crypto space. Its comprehensive roadmap, whitepaper, and strong community support have contributed to its growing popularity.

Once the token launches, the Alex The Doge roadmap will advance to its next phase, introducing key milestones including the Miracle Verse, complete with the opportunities this holds for gaming, social interaction, and DeFi, all powered by ALEX.

A ZK-rollup is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is administered by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

It provides a more scalable and suitable method for verifying transactions without sharing sensitive user data.

The co-founder of Ethereum explained how Ethereum has implemented various scaling solutions to increase throughput over the years.

Buterin cited optimism and arbitrum as two successful examples of rollups that could serve as case studies for Bitcoin, adding that scalability has been debated for Bitcoin and Ethereum for years. Adding that:

While the Ethereum network has transitioned from a proof-of-work network to a proof-of-stake network, it is experimenting with various layer-2 solutions such as ZK rollups and Plasma.

In contrast, Bitcoin's layer-2 solution, the Lightning Network, has been crucial to its scalability, and Bitcoin Ordinals have recently assisted the Bitcoin network in becoming more than just a payment layer.

Buterin praised the rise of Ordinals, stating that he believes they have reintroduced the builder culture to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

bitcoin ordinals are the most recent layer-2 solution that enables the decentralized storage of digital artwork on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Its popularity skyrocketed, and by the end of June, Bitcoin Ordinals had a trading volume of over $210 million.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-07/10/C_86585image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,7.989714,ad5749fc4243debf65a12bcdae7a5e9a

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), because of their large surface area and porosity, show great potential as adsorbents for removing pollutants, such as heavy metals, from contaminated water. The current research aims at examining copper (II) benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Cu-BTC) MOFs and understanding the mechanism for their adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solution. The Cu-BTC samples were characterized using FTIR and XRD, and their surface area and porosity were determined based on N2 adsorption isotherms. The concentration of Pb(II) in the solutions was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Both kinetic and equilibrium adsorption data were collected and then analyzed using numerical models. The analyses led to the findings that the limiting steps in the adsorption of Pb(II) on Cu-BTC are (a) pore diffusion of Pb(II) and (b) the availability of the active sites on Cu-BTC MOFs. It was further revealed that the former step is more dominant in the adsorption of Pb(II) when the lead concentration is low. The latter step, which is directly proportional to the surface areas of the MOFs, affects the adsorption to a greater extent when the lead concentration is high. The results also show that adsorption of Pb(II) ions on Cu-BTC is mainly a multi-layer heterogeneous process.",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Bazilevskaya,Ekaterina A.,Ekaterina A.

In cryptocurrency transaction networks, community detection can help identify users that are most related to known illegal users. However, there are challenges in applying community detection in cryptocurrency transaction networks: (1) the use of pseudonymous addresses that are not directly linked to personal information make it difficult to interpret the detected communities; (2) on Bitcoin, a user usually owns multiple Bitcoin addresses, and nodes in transaction networks do not always represent users. Existing works on cluster analysis on Bitcoin transaction networks focus on addressing the later using different heuristics to cluster addresses that are controlled by the same user. This research focuses on illegal community detection containing one or more illegal Bitcoin addresses. We first investigate the structure of Bitcoin transaction networks and suitable community detection methods, then collect a set of illegal addresses and use them to label the detected communities. The results show that 0.06% of communities from daily transaction networks contain one or more illegal addresses when 2,313,344 illegal addresses are used to label the communities. The results also show that distance-based clustering methods and other methods depending on them, such as network representation learning, are not suitable for Bitcoin transaction networks while community quality optimization and label-propagation-based methods are the most suitable.",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Claudio J.,Claudio J.

Represents the first large-scale order of S19j XPs from BITMAIN
 
EASTON, Md., July 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TeraWulf Inc. (Nasdaq: WULF) ('TeraWulf' or the 'Company'), owner and operator of vertically integrated, domestic Bitcoin mining facilities powered by more than 91% zero-carbon energy, today announced plans to expand its self-mining capacity to 7.9 EH/s by year end with the associated purchase of 18,500 of the next generation Antminer S19j XP bitcoin mining machines for a total price of $75 million. After coupons and credits, the Company currently expects to pay $53.4 million, or $19.10 per terahash, for the miners.
 
The new S19j XP machines will be deployed at the Company's Lake Mariner facility in New York where construction of Building 3, which will house 43 MW of capacity, is underway and targeted for completion by year-end 2023. The infrastructure expansion and additional miners are expected to increase the Company's total self-mining hashrate by approximately 58% (from 5.0 EH
1
 to 7.9 EH/s). The Company has already paid the deposit on the new miners.
 
The BITMAIN purchase order represents the first large-scale order of S19j XPs, which are the next generation unit offered by BITMAIN with a power-efficiency rating of 21.5 joules per terahash (J/TH) and a bitcoin mining hashrate of 151 terahash per second (TH/s) each, for a combined total hashrate of 2.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) for the 18,500 units. According to the purchase agreement, the 18,500 S19j XPs are scheduled to be shipped by BITMAIN in equal monthly allotments in October, November, and December.   
 
'At TeraWulf, we continue to believe that all hash is not created equal. Our planned expansion with S19j XPs will further establish TeraWulf as one of the most efficient mining fleets in the sector with a fleet efficiency of 25.7 J/TH,' said Nazar Khan, Co-founder and COO of TeraWulf. 'Coupled with a realized average cost of power of 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour and average availability in excess of 98%, we are not only expanding hashing capacity with this order but simultaneously positioning the Company for increased profit margins ahead of the next halving.'
 
Xmei Lin, Head of Sales at BITMAIN commented, 'BITMAIN is proud to partner with TeraWulf for the first large-scale order of S19j XPs. The high performance and low energy consumption of our latest generation S19j XP miners represent the most efficient mining equipment in the market and the perfect complement to TeraWulf's sustainable and low-cost mining business.'

In this paper, we predict money laundering in Bitcoin transactions by leveraging a deep learning framework and incorporating more characteristics of Bitcoin transactions. We produced a dataset containing 46,045 Bitcoin transaction entities and 319,311 Bitcoin wallet addresses associated with them. We aggregated this information to form a heterogeneous graph dataset and propose three metapath representations around transaction entities, which enrich the characteristics of Bitcoin transactions. Then, we designed a metapath encoder and integrated it into a heterogeneous graph node embedding method. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of illicit Bitcoin transaction recognition compared with traditional methods. Therefore, our proposed framework is more conducive in detecting money laundering activities in Bitcoin transactions.

252,The 2024 Bitcoin Halving May Trigger A Significant Network Hashrate Collapse,MENAFN,2023-07-27 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106721016/The-2024-Bitcoin-Halving-May-Trigger-A-Significant-Network-Hashrate-Collapse,menafn.com,"The looming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April 2024, might trigger a substantial drop in the overall computational prowess of the Bitcoin ne","Lucas Pipes, the Managing Director at B. Riley Financial, projected a decrease in Bitcoin's hashrate from 15% to 30%. Simultaneously, Colin Harper, the Chief Content Officer at Luxor Mining, a renowned mining services corporation, also anticipated a possible 20% decrease.

Every four years, the Bitcoin network undergoes a significant event referred to as the halving. In essence, this phenomenon halves the reward miners acquire for successfully mining a block, regulating the blockchain's supply economics. Following the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the reward will diminish from the existing 6.25 BTC to a lower 3.125 BTC for every successfully mined block.

The Bitcoin halving event profoundly affects the cost dynamics of Bitcoin mining. As the rewards are slashed by half, the cost of mining a single block effectively doubles. Unless the price of Bitcoin witnesses considerable positive momentum, the result could lead miners to switch off their machines. Consequently, this action would lower the network's hashrate .

Miners increasingly invest in new-generation mining rigs as part of their survival strategy. Due to their superior design and technological advancement, these machines demand less power to mine a block successfully.

The cost of power is typically the most significant expenditure in a miner's operation. Hence, mitigating this expense is pivotal to surviving the ramifications of the halving. Over the past year, the Bitcoin network hashrate has experienced an upswing due to an increasing number of machines becoming operational. Additionally, the efficiency of these machines has roughly doubled in the past five years. That showcases the industry's stride toward power-efficient operations.

The impending Bitcoin halving event brings a sea of changes in the mining landscape. From reduced rewards to a potential drop in network hashrate, the Bitcoin ecosystem is set for another test of resilience and adaptability. As the halving approaches, miners, stakeholders, and enthusiasts alike wait with bated breath to witness the unfolding of this significant event and its subsequent ripple effects on the cryptocurrency market.

J","James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, reported on July 24 that bitcoin investment products experienced $13 million in outflows for the week ending July 21, reversing five weeks of inflows.

Additionally, short Bitcoin products saw outflows of $5.5 million last week. Ether and XRP investment products, on the other hand, saw a combined $9.2 million inflow over the past week.





Butterfill noted that Ether investment products had the greatest performance last week with $6.6 million in inflows, while xrp funds recorded $2.6 million in inflows.

Solana and Polygon, two alternative cryptocurrencies, recorded inflows of $1,100,000 and $70,000, respectively.

The apparent change of heart followed Ripple's partial victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13, in which the court ruled that XRP is not a security when traded on exchanges.

The news caused the price of XRP to surge by 76% to $0.83 before settling at $0.69 at the time of writing.

'These miners are among our best performers in our air-cooled StrongBox containers and provide an attractive value proposition given the combination of high hash rate, energy efficiency, and price point. The purchase of these miners further demonstrates our extreme focus on capital efficiency.'
 
'As we have demonstrated in 2023, we believe that our approach to acquiring Bitcoin miners is differentiated from our peers. We are able to fund the purchase of the 2,000 A1346 out of our currently available cash on hand. Additionally, the expansion of our hosting agreement allows us to further retain exposure to Bitcoin mining economics and power upside, consistent with our vertically integrated business model. This compares favorably versus our peers that are announcing large miner orders that we believe will require, in some cases, substantial future equity offerings,' said Mr. Beard. 'Similar to our miner purchases earlier in the year, we believe that the cash flow uplift from this expansion will allow us to recover our entire investment in less than one year based on current hash price, forward power prices, and 95% assumed miner uptime.'
 
Nangeng Zhang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canaan, commented, 'We are delighted to continue and upgrade our existing collaboration with Stronghold. At Canaan, our focus has always been on delivering products that embody advanced technology, outstanding performance, exceptional quality, and high maintainability. Beyond our products, we are committed to elevating value for our clients through unparalleled service, striving to maximize their capital efficiency to the utmost. Our dedication has distinguished us with world-class service, flexible win-win solutions, and unwavering long-term support. We are proud of the trust that Stronghold has placed in our brand, and we sincerely value our continuing collaboration.'

In this paper, a hybrid of a Wavelet Decomposition–Generalised Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity–Extreme Value Theory (WD-ARMA-GARCH-EVT) model is applied to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) of BitCoin (BTC/USD) and the South African Rand (ZAR/USD). The aim is to measure and compare the riskiness of the two currencies. New and improved estimation techniques for VaR have been suggested in the last decade in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008. This paper aims to provide an improved alternative to the already existing statistical tools in estimating a currency VaR empirically. Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and two mother wavelet filters on the returns series are considered in this paper, viz., the Haar and Daubechies (d4). The findings show that BitCoin/USD is riskier than ZAR/USD since it has a higher VaR per unit invested in each currency. At the 99% significance level, BitCoin/USD has average values of VaR of 2.71% and 4.98% for the WD-ARMA-GARCH-GPD and WD-ARMA-GARCH-GEVD models, respectively; and this is slightly higher than the respective 2.69% and 3.59% for the ZAR/USD. The average BitCoin/USD returns of 0.001990 are higher than ZAR/USD returns of −0.000125. These findings are consistent with the mean-variance portfolio theory, which suggests a higher yield for riskier assets. Based on the 
p
-values of the Kupiec likelihood ratio test, the hybrid model adequacy is largely accepted, as 
p
-values are greater than 0.05, except for the WD-ARMA-GARCH-GEVD models at a 99% significance level for both currencies. The findings are helpful to financial risk practitioners and forex traders in formulating their diversification and hedging strategies and ascertaining the risk-adjusted capital requirement to be set aside as a cushion in the event of the occurrence of an actual loss.

The identified clusters, including safe haven, internet of things (IoT), proof of work (PoW), market efficiency, sentiment analysis, digital currency, and privacy, shed light on the multifaceted discourse surrounding bitcoin.

The analysis underscores the transformation of bitcoin research, from its beginnings as a decentralized, privacy-oriented currency to its role in global economics and green financing, revealing a complex narrative of an innovative financial instrument to a multifaceted entity. Implications drawn from this analysis include the need for further research on the potential integration of bitcoin within emerging technologies like AI and cybersecurity, the implications of bitcoin's interplay with traditional financial systems, and the environmental impacts of bitcoin and blockchain utilization.

This news release constitutes a 'designated news release' for purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated August 16, 2021, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated August 12, 2021.
 
TORONTO, Ontario and BROSSARD, Québec, Aug. 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (
NASDAQ: BITF//TSX: BITF
), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company, provides a Bitcoin (BTC) production and mining operations update for July 2023.
 
'We follow a disciplined and accretive growth strategy of securing low-cost power and investing capital wisely in highly efficient operations with compelling projected returns,' said Geoff Morphy, CEO of Bitfarms. 'To this end, in July we initiated an expansion plan to nearly double our hydropower capacity to 350 MW by acquiring 150 MW of under-utilized hydropower in Paraguay. As an industry veteran of over five years with operations in four countries, Bitfarms has a proven track record of expeditiously establishing operations in new jurisdictions. Through expansion in Paraguay, the Company seeks to leverage its industry knowledge and economies of scale to drive greater production efficiency. We plan to commence construction on the first 50 MW facility here in Q3 2023.'
 
'In July, we started production at our 11th farm in Baie-Comeau. It is on track to reach its first 11 MW of production in Q3 2023 with an additional 11 MW targeted to come online in 2H 2024. Upon completion, Baie-Comeau will increase our Quebec portfolio to 8 sites and 170 MW of low-cost hydro power. With miner deliveries and installations progressing smoothly in Rio Cuarto, Argentina, we are confident we will achieve our Q3 2023 target hashrate of 6.3 EH/s,' concluded Morphy.
 
Ben Gagnon, Chief Mining Officer of Bitfarms, said, 'In July, BTC production was 378, compared to 385 BTC in June 2023 as difficulty increased another 3.3% in the month. Production was also impacted by intense weather events, including record temperatures and unprecedented wildfires that led to poor air quality in Quebec and resulted in the temporary throttling back of miners. In addition, our Magog farm went offline for 7 days because of a direct lightning strike that disabled its primary electricity transformer, although no other damage was incurred.
 
'Our strategy for risk mitigation incorporates redundancy and geographic diversification. In the case of Magog, the outage impacted only a small percentage of overall production. Utilizing our highly skilled in-house electrical subsidiary and reserve equipment and parts, we were able to restore production in less than a week, rather than potentially a month or more if we needed to order parts and equipment,' added Gagnon.
 
The average BTC price rose in July to $30,100, up 9.1% from $27,600 in June. Of the 378 BTC mined, 333 BTC were sold and 45 BTC were added to treasury, which reached 594 BTC at July 31, 2023.
 
Mining Review 
 
July production of 378 BTC was 1.8% lower than the 385 BTC mined in June largely due to disruptions caused by extreme weather resulting in lower average EH/s online.
 
Network difficulty increased 3.3% in July compared to June as Bitcoin miners continue to invest in capacity in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices. Difficulty is up 48.0% year-to-date in 2023, while the BTC price is up roughly 76.5% in the same period, resulting in a 21.0% improvement in mining economics as measured by USD/TH/day.

262,The Evolution Of Bitcoin,MENAFN,2023-07-30 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106738882/The-Evolution-Of-Bitcoin-A-Historical-Overview,menafn.com,"Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the world of finance since its inception. Created in 2008 by an enigmatic figure known as","This historical overview traces the remarkable evolution of Bitcoin from its humble beginnings as a concept in Nakamoto's whitepaper to its status as a globally recognized digital asset.

Exploring key milestones, challenges, and achievements, this narrative sheds light on the transformative impact Bitcoin has had on the financial landscape and its potential role in shaping the future of money.

The early days of Bitcoin were marked by the release of its whitepaper titled'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' in October 2008 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

The whitepaper laid the foundation for a decentralized digital currency that would enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks.

On January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the'genesis block,' which included the message'The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.'

This message is widely regarded as a commentary on the vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system and serves as a significant statement about Bitcoin's purpose.

During the early days, Bitcoin attracted a small but passionate community of enthusiasts and developers who saw its potential as a disruptive force in finance. The first Bitcoin transaction occurred on January 12, 2009, when Nakamoto sent 10 bitcoins to computer programmer Hal Finney as a test.

Bitcoin's value in its early days was meager, with negligible trading and limited recognition. Early adopters and miners could acquire large amounts of Bitcoin at a fraction of a cent.

The first notable transaction involving Bitcoin occurred in May 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz famously bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, highlighting its use as a medium of exchange.

Mining in the early days was relatively easy, and individuals could mine Bitcoin using their personal computers. However, as interest in Bitcoin grew, the mining difficulty increased, leading to the emergence of specialized mining hardware and mining pools.

Bitcoin faced skepticism and criticism throughout its early years, with many questioning its viability and dismissing it as a fad. Nonetheless, the community's resilience, technological developments, and growing adoption created a strong foundation for Bitcoin's future growth.

The early days of Bitcoin were characterized by experimentation, a close-knit community, and a vision for disrupting the traditional financial system. As time passed, these initial steps paved the way for the remarkable evolution that would see Bitcoin become a prominent player in the global financial landscape.

The emergence of cryptocurrency exchanges played a pivotal role in the growth and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. In the early days of Bitcoin, the only way to acquire or trade digital currency was through direct peer-to-peer transactions.

However, as the interest in cryptocurrencies started to gain momentum, the need for a more efficient and user-friendly way to buy, sell, and trade digital assets became evident.

The first cryptocurrency exchange,'BitcoinMarket.com,' was established in March 2010, providing a platform for users to trade Bitcoin against fiat currencies like the US Dollar.

However, the'Mt. Gox' launch in July 2010 revolutionized the landscape. Mt. Gox, short for'Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange,' was originally a platform for trading cards but shifted its focus to Bitcoin. It quickly became the dominant exchange, handling over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions at its peak.

As Bitcoin's popularity grew, more exchanges emerged to meet the increasing demand for cryptocurrency trading. These exchanges allowed users to trade various cryptocurrencies against one another and fiat currencies. Some of the early exchanges that gained traction include'Bitstamp' (2011),'BTC-e' (2011), and'Bitfinex' (2012).

The proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges enabled greater liquidity, price discovery, and market efficiency. It also introduced an essential element of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it more accessible to a broader audience, including investors, traders, and enthusiasts.

However, with the rise of cryptocurrency exchanges came specific challenges and risks. Mt. Gox's infamous hack in 2014 resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins and raised concerns about security and regulatory oversight in the industry.

As a response, many exchanges started implementing stringent security measures, such as two-factor authentication and cold storage of user funds.

Over the years, cryptocurrency exchanges have evolved significantly, offering various features, including advanced trading options, margin trading, and different altcoin pairs.

They have become a vital part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, facilitating the exchange of digital assets and contributing to the overall growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide.

As the cryptocurrency market matures, regulatory frameworks around exchanges have also been developed in different jurisdictions to protect users and prevent fraudulent activities. Despite the challenges and occasional controversies, cryptocurrency exchanges remain essential players in the ongoing evolution of the digital asset space.

Increasing adoption and mainstream recognition have been crucial milestones in the evolution of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As the technology behind digital assets improved and awareness grew, several factors contributed to their broader acceptance and integration into various sectors:



Expanding Merchant Acceptance

Bitcoin in Popular Media

Wall Street's Engagement with Bitcoin

Regulatory Clarity and Recognition

Bitcoin ATMs

Cryptocurrency Derivatives and Financial Products

Global Economic Events

Payment Processors and Wallets Education and Awareness Efforts

Over time, more businesses started accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment for goods and services. Major companies, including Microsoft, Expedia, and Shopify, began incorporating cryptocurrency payment options, enhancing the practicality of using Bitcoin in everyday transactions.

As Bitcoin gained traction, it started to feature prominently in mainstream media, including news articles, TV shows, and movies. Media exposure helped introduce cryptocurrencies to a broader audience, sparking curiosity and interest.

Traditional financial institutions and Wall Street players began to explore and invest in Bitcoin. The involvement of institutional investors and prominent figures like Elon Musk brought further legitimacy and confidence to the cryptocurrency market.

Various countries started developing regulatory frameworks to address cryptocurrencies' legal status and use. Some nations recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method or asset, providing a more straightforward path for businesses and individuals to participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The deployment of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide made it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin using cash or credit cards. These ATMs expanded access to cryptocurrencies, particularly for those without access to traditional banking services.

Introducing cryptocurrency derivatives, futures contracts, and other financial products allowed investors to speculate on Bitcoin's price movements without owning the underlying asset. This helped attract more traditional investors to the crypto market.

Economic instability in specific regions and currency devaluation prompted people to seek alternative stores of value, increasing interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as potential hedges against economic uncertainties.

The development of user-friendly cryptocurrency wallets and payment processors facilitated easy and secure storage and transactions of digital assets, encouraging more people to participate in the crypto economy.

Communities, organizations, and influencers played a significant role in educating the public about cryptocurrencies' benefits and potential use cases, demystifying complex concepts, and dispelling misconceptions.

As adoption and recognition increased, so did the overall market capitalization and liquidity of cryptocurrencies. However, mainstream recognition also brought scrutiny and challenges.

Regulatory developments, security concerns, and market volatility were critical to address for the sustained growth and long-term acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial systems .

Nonetheless, the increasing adoption and integration of Bitcoin into various sectors marked a significant step toward its broader societal impact.

Technology and scaling solutions have been crucial in addressing the challenges that emerged as Bitcoin gained popularity and faced scalability issues. Several developments and proposals have been implemented to enhance the performance, efficiency, and scalability of the Bitcoin network. Some notable ones include:



Segregated Witness (SegWit)

The Bitcoin Lightning Network

Schnorr Signatures

Taproot

Sidechains

Segregated Witness (SegWit) Adoption and Lightning Network Implementation

Layer 2 Solutions Research and Development

SegWit was activated in August 2017 as a soft fork, and it aimed to solve the problem of transaction malleability while indirectly increasing the block size limit. By separating transaction signature data from the transaction block, SegWit increased the block's capacity, allowing more transactions to be processed in each block.

The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution built on the Bitcoin blockchain. It enables fast and low-cost micropayments by creating off-chain payment channels between users. This alleviates the pressure on the main blockchain, reducing transaction fees and increasing transaction speeds.

Schnorr Signatures, once activated, will improve privacy and scalability. Aggregating multiple signatures into a single signature will lead to smaller transaction sizes, further optimizing the use of block space.

Taproot is a proposed upgrade to enhance Bitcoin's smart contract capabilities, privacy, and efficiency. It will enable more complex and private transactions, allowing for greater flexibility while reducing the transaction data size.

Sidechains are separate blockchains that are interoperable with the main Bitcoin blockchain. They allow experimentation with new features, scalability solutions, and functionalities without directly affecting the main chain.

SegWit adoption and the growth of the Lightning Network have significantly improved Bitcoin's scalability and transaction throughput, allowing it to process more transactions per second.

Besides the Lightning Network, other Layer 2 solutions, like the Liquid Network, have been introduced to facilitate faster and more private transactions for specific use cases.

Continuous research and development efforts by the Bitcoin Core developers and the broader community are focused on exploring and proposing further scalability solutions to meet the growing demand for Bitcoin transactions.

These technological advancements and scaling solutions have addressed some of the early scalability concerns of Bitcoin, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

However, the Bitcoin community's ongoing focus remains the challenge of achieving global scalability while maintaining decentralization and security. As the network continues to evolve, further improvements are expected to enhance its performance and enable broader adoption for various real-world applications.

Forks and altcoins are essential aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, representing the divergent paths and innovations in the broader blockchain space. Here's an overview of forks and altcoins:



Soft Fork: A soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade to the blockchain protocol, where new rules are implemented, but old nodes can still recognize and process the new blocks. It maintains consensus within the network, but non-upgraded nodes might not be able to take advantage of new features. Hard Fork: A hard fork is a more substantial and non-backward-compatible change to the blockchain protocol. It results in a permanent split, creating two separate blockchains. Nodes not upgrading to the new rules will continue on the original blockchain, while nodes adopting the changes will follow the new chain. Examples of hard forks in Bitcoin include Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.



Altcoin is a term used to refer to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. These coins were created as alternatives to Bitcoin and often feature different technologies, use cases, and consensus mechanisms. Some of the early altcoins include Litecoin, launched in 2011, which aimed to provide faster transaction confirmation times than Bitcoin.

Ethereum, launched in 2015, is another notable altcoin that introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain. Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), and many others are examples of altcoins that have gained popularity and recognition for their unique features and utilities.



Technical Improvements: Forks and altcoins often emerge to address technical limitations of existing cryptocurrencies, such as scalability, transaction speed, and energy consumption.

Ideological Differences: Forks can result from disagreements within the community over the direction of a project or fundamental principles. These disagreements can lead to contentious hard forks, as seen in the cases of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.

Experimentation and Innovation: Altcoins offer a platform for experimentation with new technologies and ideas that might not be feasible to implement directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Specific Use Cases: Some altcoins are designed to cater to specific use cases or industries, such as privacy-focused coins like Monero or tokens facilitating decentralized finance (DeFi) on platforms like Ethereum.

It is essential to note that while forks and altcoins offer diversity and innovation, they also contribute to fragmentation and competition within the cryptocurrency space.

Investors and users should carefully research and assess cryptocurrency's underlying technology, team, and community support before participating in the market.

Additionally, regulatory considerations and potential risks associated with lesser-known altcoins should be considered when trading cryptocurrency and investing.

Regulatory developments and legal challenges have significantly influenced the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As this relatively new technology emerged, governments and regulatory bodies worldwide grappled with how to classify and oversee cryptocurrencies.

Here are some critical aspects related to regulatory developments and legal challenges:



Lack of Clarity

Regulatory Approaches

KYC and AML Compliance

Taxation

ICO Regulation

Security and Consumer Protection Exchange Licensing

In the early days of cryptocurrencies, clear regulatory guidelines were lacking. Countries and jurisdictions treat cryptocurrencies differently, leading to uncertainty for businesses, investors, and users.

Countries have taken various approaches to regulating cryptocurrencies. Some have embraced them, recognizing them as legal tender or assets, while others have imposed restrictions or outright bans.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms now require Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to comply with regulations and prevent illicit activities.

Taxation rules for cryptocurrencies have been debated and developed in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have been working to establish guidelines for reporting and taxing cryptocurrency transactions.

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) faced regulatory scrutiny due to concerns about fraudulent schemes . Some countries have introduced regulations to protect investors from potential scams.

Regulatory efforts aim to protect consumers and investors from cybersecurity risks, fraud, and other potential dangers of using cryptocurrencies.

Some countries require cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain licenses to operate legally, imposing specific requirements for security and compliance.

The evolving regulatory landscape can impact cryptocurrency adoption and investment. Clear and favorable regulations may encourage businesses and investors to participate, fostering innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency space.

On the other hand, overly restrictive regulations or uncertainty may deter potential users and investments.

As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the mainstream financial system, regulatory developments, and legal challenges will play a vital role in shaping the industry's future. Striking a balance between innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability remains challenging for policymakers worldwide.

Institutional adoption and investment in cryptocurrencies have significantly driven the industry's growth and maturation. In recent years, we have witnessed a notable increase in interest and participation from traditional financial institutions, corporations, and asset managers.

Here are some critical aspects related to institutional adoption and investment in cryptocurrencies:



Recognition of Digital Assets

Institutional Investment Products

Corporate Treasury Holdings

Investment Funds Regulatory Clarity

Major financial institutions and asset management firms have started recognizing cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. They now view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential stores of value, hedges against inflation, and diversification tools for investment portfolios.

The demand from institutional investors has led to the creation of various investment products, such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), futures contracts, and institutional-grade custody services. These products provide institutional investors with regulated, secure avenues for cryptocurrency exposure.

Several prominent companies, including Tesla and MicroStrategy, have publicly disclosed their investments in Bitcoin as part of their corporate treasury holdings. This move signals their confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value and potential as a hedge against traditional currency risks.

Traditional hedge funds and investment firms have started dedicating portions of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies. Some have launched specialized cryptocurrency funds to cater to their clients' growing interest in digital assets.

As regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies have evolved, it has provided institutional investors with more confidence and clarity when considering investments in the asset class.

While institutional adoption has undoubtedly brought positive developments to the cryptocurrency space, it has also introduced challenges.

Increased institutional interest can lead to higher competition for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially impacting retail investors. Additionally, regulatory considerations and compliance requirements for institutional investors add complexity to their involvement in the market.

Institutional adoption and investment in cryptocurrencies will likely continue shaping the industry's future, fostering innovation, and increasing its integration into the broader financial ecosystem.

Environmental concerns and sustainable mining practices have become important topics of discussion in cryptocurrency mining, particularly for Bitcoin, which relies on an energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Here are some critical aspects related to environmental concerns and efforts toward sustainable mining:



Energy Consumption

Carbon Footprint

E-Waste

Renewable Energy Initiatives

Energy Efficiency Improvements Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Alternatives

Bitcoin mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles using computational power. As more miners participate in securing the network, the competition increases, leading to higher energy consumption. This has raised concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.

Most Bitcoin mining occurs in regions where electricity is generated from fossil fuels, leading to a significant carbon footprint. Critics argue that the carbon emissions from mining operations contribute to climate change.

The mining process requires specialized hardware that has a limited lifespan. Disposing of outdated or broken mining equipment can contribute to improper recycling of electronic waste (e-waste).

Some cryptocurrency mining operations are exploring or transitioning to renewable energy sources like hydro, wind, and solar energy. This move aims to reduce the carbon footprint associated with mining activities.

Efforts are being made to develop more energy-efficient mining hardware and optimize mining operations to reduce energy consumption per hash rate.

PoS is an alternative consensus mechanism that requires validators to hold and'stake' a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. This method is considered more energy-efficient compared to PoW.

It is important to note that while the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is a valid concern, the overall energy consumption of the cryptocurrency industry is still relatively small compared to traditional financial systems and other industries.

Nevertheless, sustainability efforts and responsible mining practices are crucial for the industry's long-term viability and acceptance, as they address environmental concerns and public perception.

As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, developing more eco-friendly consensus mechanisms and sustainable mining practices will be essential to ensure a greener future for the industry.

The future of Bitcoin holds both excitement and uncertainty as the cryptocurrency continues to evolve and gain mainstream recognition. While predicting the future with certainty is challenging, several trends and potential developments can be considered:



Increased Adoption

Regulatory Clarity

Technological Advancements

Sustainable Mining

Decentralization Institutional Investment

As more individuals, businesses, and institutions recognize Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, its adoption will likely continue growing. Increased acceptance and integration into various sectors could lead to further market maturity.

Regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies are expected to continue developing, providing more precise guidelines for businesses and investors. This clarity may attract more institutional participation and capital inflows.

Bitcoin's underlying technology will likely see continuous improvement. Upgrades like the Lightning Network, Schnorr Signatures, and Taproot can enhance scalability, privacy, and transaction efficiency.

The cryptocurrency community is increasingly aware of the environmental impact of mining. Efforts towards sustainable mining using renewable energy sources and energy-efficient hardware are expected to gain traction.

Maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network will remain a priority. Efforts to ensure a distributed and resilient network will continue to be emphasized.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin will likely persist, leading to more investment products and offerings tailored for institutional investors.

While the future of Bitcoin appears promising, it will face challenges as well. Scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory developments are among the key areas that the Bitcoin community must address to ensure its continued growth and relevance.

As the cryptocurrency industry matures, Bitcoin's role as a pioneer and standard-bearer will likely continue to be influential, shaping the direction of the broader blockchain and digital asset space. Nonetheless, adaptation to changing circumstances and ongoing community collaboration will be vital for Bitcoin to navigate its path forward.

The evolution of Bitcoin has been nothing short of extraordinary. From its humble beginnings in a whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has grown into a globally recognized and transformative digital asset.

The early days of Bitcoin were marked by experimentation, a passionate community, and the laying of the foundation for a decentralized financial system.

As we move forward, the legacy of Bitcoin will be remembered as a catalyst for innovation, sparking a revolution in finance and inspiring the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Its journey is a testament to the power of decentralized technology and the potential for digital assets to reshape the financial world.

While Bitcoin exhibits promising potential for long-term growth and can serve as an inflation hedge, its volatility poses considerable risks. Investors must be prepared to navigate substantial price fluctuations and embrace the associated uncertainties.

Regulatory and security concerns within the cryptocurrency space necessitate comprehensive evaluation. bitcoin ought to be regarded as a supplementary element within a well-diversified retirement portfolio, rather than an exclusive avenue. It is imperative to evaluate individual risk tolerance, investment objectives, and seek guidance from a financial advisor well-versed in cryptocurrency investments to make an informed decision regarding integrating Bitcoin into a retirement strategy.

Establishing precise investment objectives serves as the guiding principle behind a successful retirement plan, and the inclusion of Bitcoin into one's investment mix is no exception. Prior to embarking on this alternative investment journey, individuals should engage in introspection to identify their unique financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

For some, the primary focus may revolve around capital preservation, seeking to safeguard their wealth against inflation and economic uncertainties. Bitcoin's limited supply and potential as a hedge against traditional financial systems have attracted investors seeking to diversify and shield their assets from currency devaluation.

Others may lean towards a more aggressive growth approach, aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin's historical price appreciation and its potential to outperform traditional asset classes. The allure of potentially high returns has enticed risk-tolerant investors to explore this dynamic market, eager to seize opportunities presented by Bitcoin's price volatility.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that investing in Bitcoin entails inherent risk due to its unique attributes and evolving regulatory environment. There are no promises of returns, as there never are with any investment, and past results shouldn't be used to predict future results. Consequently, aligning one's investment objectives with their risk appetite is of utmost importance, ensuring financial peace of mind and mitigating stress during market fluctuations.

Achieving the optimal balance between risk and profit depends on figuring out how much Bitcoin to include in one's overall investing portfolio. While diversification aids in spreading risk, an excessively concentrated allocation in any single asset, including Bitcoin, can expose investors to heightened volatility and potential losses.

Ultimately, the decision to explore Bitcoin as a retirement investment avenue mandates a thorough evaluation of individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial position. Engaging with financial experts and staying abreast of market developments will empower individuals to make well-informed decisions, maximizing the potential benefits of integrating Bitcoin into their retirement strategy.

Bitcoin has exhibited an impressive history of value appreciation , attracting investors in pursuit of substantial returns. Despite occasional market corrections and price volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated consistent growth over time. Factors such as its limited supply, increasing adoption, and institutional interest have contributed to its upward trajectory.

A comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin's historical performance and underlying technology is imperative in evaluating its future growth potential. By incorporating an asset with such promising growth prospects into a retirement portfolio, individuals can aim to accumulate wealth gradually and potentially secure a financially stable retirement.

Incorporating Bitcoin's potential for long-term growth into a retirement strategy offers several compelling advantages. Firstly, it allows investors to capitalize on the significant returns that Bitcoin has historically delivered. By including an asset with high growth potential, individuals can potentially enhance the overall performance of their retirement portfolio.

Effectively managing your investments, including Bitcoin as part of your retirement strategy, necessitates a methodical and prudent approach. As the cryptocurrency market operates around the clock and exhibits high volatility, staying well-informed and actively monitoring your portfolio becomes paramount.

Firstly, devise a well-defined investment plan customized to suit your specific financial objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Determine the percentage of your portfolio you feel comfortable allocating to Bitcoin, and remain prepared to periodically adjust this allocation in response to changing market conditions and your personal circumstances.

Conduct regular reviews of your investment portfolio and make necessary adjustments. This is not suggest making rash decisions based on brief market fluctuations. Rather, reevaluate your entire investment plan to make sure it is in line with your long-term objectives.

Given Bitcoin's inherent volatility, contemplate adopting dollar-cost averaging as a strategy, investing gradually over time instead of lump-sum transactions. This approach helps smooth the impact of price fluctuations and minimizes the risk of investing all your funds at an unfavorable price.

Utilize secure and reputable cryptocurrency wallets to safeguard your Bitcoin holdings. Hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor, provide an additional layer of protection against potential cyber threats. Always keep your wallet credentials and private keys secure and avoid sharing them with anyone.

Stay apprised of cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory changes. The landscape continuously evolves, and alterations in regulations can influence the value and legality of cryptocurrencies. Awareness of such developments enables informed decision-making and compliance with applicable laws.

Exercise patience when dealing with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's not uncommon for prices to experience significant fluctuations. Avoid making rash judgments based on short-term market fluctuations and instead concentrate on the possible long-term returns from your assets.

Lastly, consider seeking guidance from financial experts with experience in cryptocurrencies and retirement planning. A knowledgeable financial advisor can guide you through the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. They can create an investment plan that is balanced and specific to your needs.

The continuous devaluation of traditional currencies due to inflation can erode the purchasing power of retirement savings over time. Its decentralized nature and predictable production rate mitigate the risk of arbitrary increases in supply that devalue fiat currencies. Consequently, Bitcoin's scarcity and independence from central authorities make it an effective hedge against inflation , preserving the value of retirement funds and shielding them from the erosive effects of rising prices in the economy.

Bitcoin provides an avenue for portfolio diversification within retirement investments. By incorporating Bitcoin alongside traditional assets like stocks and bonds, investors can mitigate risks associated with relying solely on a single asset class and potentially enhance the overall performance of their portfolio.

Its decentralized nature and increasing acceptance provide individuals with greater autonomy over their retirement savings, reducing dependence on centralized financial institutions. Even within cryptocurrencies, you need to diversify between different coins by regularly checking Bitcoin and litecoin price and choosing what fits you.

However, it is crucial to approach Bitcoin as a retirement strategy cautiously, taking into account individual risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and seeking expert advice to ensure a well-informed and balanced approach to retirement planning.

Security remains an utmost priority when considering any investment option, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, operates on an innovative technology known for its resilience and privacy. This advanced system, blockchain, ensures that all transactions are securely recorded in an unalterable manner across a distributed network of nodes, guaranteeing the overall system's credibility and integrity.

Additionally, Bitcoin employs robust encryption techniques that effectively safeguard against fraudulent activities and counterfeiting attempts, providing investors with an added layer of protection. Unlike conventional financial structures, Bitcoin's decentralized nature eliminates any single point of vulnerability susceptible to breaches or malicious attacks.

However, despite the proven strength of Bitcoin's blockchain and cryptographic measures, it's essential to recognize that the cryptocurrency landscape may face potential cyber risks. The responsible management of one's digital assets becomes crucial for long-term investors. Employing secure wallets, implementing strong passwords, and adopting a vigilant approach to security are paramount in safeguarding one's Bitcoin investment for the future.

When exploring Bitcoin as a retirement investment option, it's essential to carefully analyze the existing market landscape. Bitcoin, renowned for its substantial price volatility, can undergo significant fluctuations over short timeframes, presenting potential opportunities and risks for investors. Being well-informed about market trends, historical price patterns, and factors influencing Bitcoin's valuation is vital for making prudent decisions.

The movements of Bitcoin's price can be heavily influenced by market sentiment and investor behavior. Positive news, regulatory advancements, institutional interest, and macroeconomic conditions can drive demand and subsequent price surges. Conversely, negative news, regulatory uncertainties, or global economic instability can trigger sharp price corrections.

To incorporate Bitcoin into one's investment portfolio , diversification with traditional assets and understanding individual risk tolerance becomes crucial. As a relatively new and evolving asset class, the long-term performance of Bitcoin and its correlation with conventional markets are still subjects of debate within the financial community.

The limited supply of 21 million coins contributes to Bitcoin's deflationary nature. This scarcity could potentially lead to long-term price appreciation, but market dynamics, supply and demand imbalances, and halving events (periodic reductions in mining rewards) can also exert considerable influence on its value.

Investors should proceed with caution, conduct thorough research, and seek advice from financial experts. They can help assess the suitability of Bitcoin as a retirement investment considering the prevailing market conditions. While it has demonstrated significant growth over the past decade, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Embrace a cautious and well-informed approach when considering Bitcoin as part of your retirement strategy.

Regulatory and legal uncertainties surrounding Bitcoin should be considered. The cryptocurrency industry's regulatory landscape is continuously evolving and changes in regulations can have a substantial impact on the market. Government actions and restrictions can affect the overall viability and liquidity of Bitcoin as an investment. Staying informed about legal and regulatory developments and evaluating their potential implications for Bitcoin as a retirement investment is essential.

Another critical consideration is the security of Bitcoin holdings. Being a digital asset, Bitcoin is susceptible to hacking attempts, scams, and other cybersecurity threats. Investors must implement robust security measures to safeguard their Bitcoin investments, including using secure wallets and following proper security protocols. Limited liquidity can present challenges when buying or selling Bitcoin at desired prices, potentially impacting the execution of investment strategies effectively.

Considering these risks and challenges is vital for investors when incorporating bitcoin into their retirement strategy . Seeking guidance from a knowledgeable financial advisor experienced in cryptocurrency investments can assist in navigating these risks. And, this can also help you make well-informed decisions that align with individual risk tolerance and long-term financial goals.

Including Bitcoin in a retirement strategy presents potential advantages such as long-term growth, protection against inflation, and portfolio diversification. However, it is crucial to approach this investment option with caution and diligence. Retirement planning necessitates a balanced approach that considers personal risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives.

Recently, various methods to predict the future price of financial assets have emerged. One promising approach is to combine the historic price with sentiment scores derived via sentiment analysis techniques. In this article, we focus on predicting the future price of Bitcoin, which is currently the most popular cryptocurrency. More precisely, we propose a hybrid approach, combining time series forecasting and sentiment prediction from microblogs, to predict the intraday price of Bitcoin. Moreover, in addition to standard sentiment analysis methods, we are the first to employ a fine-tuned BERT model for this task. We also introduce a novel weighting scheme in which the weight of the sentiment of each tweet depends on the number of its creator's followers. For evaluation, we consider periods with strongly varying ranges of Bitcoin prices. This enables us to assess the models w.r.t. robustness and generalization to varied market conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that BERT-based sentiment analysis and the proposed weighting scheme improve upon previous methods. Specifically, our hybrid models that use linear regression as the underlying forecasting algorithm perform best in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE of 2.67) and root mean squared error (RMSE of 3.28). However, more complicated models, particularly long short-term memory networks and temporal convolutional networks, tend to have generalization and overfitting issues, resulting in considerably higher MAE and RMSE scores.

eth /usd is at a key uptrend line support. What is the outlook and what are the key levels to watch?

On the daily charts, despite the recent softness, BTC/USD has managed to hold quite strong support around 28500, roughly coinciding with the 89-day moving average and the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts.

After the sharp rise from the end of June, ETH/USD's uptrend appears to have stalled. The recent minor retreat has brought ETH/USD toward strong converged support, including the 200-day moving average, and the 89-day moving average. Importantly, it holds above major support at the June low of 1620. The interim bias (from the end of 2022) remains up while this support is intact. On the upside, the May and July highs of 2020-2030 are crucial barriers.

Sending BTC to a SegWit address requires a compatible Bitcoin wallet and offers benefits like reduced fees and faster transactions.

As you navigate through this process, consider using the profit-revolution.com automated trading bot. It can significantly streamline your Bitcoin transactions and trades.

When it comes to sending BTC from non-SegWit addresses to SegWit addresses, compatibility is an essential aspect to consider. The Bitcoin network is designed to handle such transactions seamlessly, allowing users to transfer their funds to SegWit addresses without major complications.

To initiate the transfer, you'll need a Bitcoin wallet that supports SegWit transactions. Most modern wallets have integrated SegWit functionality, enabling users to send BTC to SegWit addresses effortlessly.

The process involves opening your Bitcoin wallet and locating the option to send BTC. From there, you enter the recipient's SegWit address in the designated field and specify the amount of BTC you wish to send.

During the transfer, it's important to note that the size of the transaction may impact the fee amount and confirmation time. SegWit transactions are generally smaller in size compared to non-SegWit transactions, which allows users to enjoy reduced fees and faster confirmations.

While the compatibility between non-SegWit and SegWit addresses is well-established, it's worth mentioning that the reverse process is not possible.

In other words, you cannot send BTC from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address directly. However, there are services and tools available that allow for conversion between different address types if needed.

Overall, the compatibility of sending BTC to a SegWit address is a straightforward process. As long as you have a compatible wallet and follow the necessary steps, you can enjoy the benefits of SegWit, such as reduced fees and improved transaction speeds, without any major hurdles.

To send BTC to a SegWit address, you need to follow a few simple steps. First, open your Bitcoin wallet and navigate to the'Send' or'Send BTC' section. This option is typically found in the main menu or toolbar of the wallet interface.

In this section, you will be prompted to enter the recipient's SegWit address. It is crucial to copy and paste the address accurately to avoid any errors. SegWit addresses usually start with'bc1' and are longer than traditional Bitcoin addresses.

Once you have entered the recipient's SegWit address, specify the amount of BTC you want to send. Most wallets provide options to either manually enter the exact amount or choose from predetermined amounts. Make sure to double-check the amount to ensure accuracy.

Before proceeding with the transaction, it is essential to review all the details carefully. Verify the recipient's SegWit address, the amount of BTC you are sending, and any additional options or settings related to the transaction. This step is crucial to prevent any mistakes or potential loss of funds.

Depending on your wallet's interface, you may have the option to adjust the transaction fee. Consider the current network congestion and the desired confirmation time when selecting the fee.

Keep in mind that SegWit transactions often have lower fees compared to non-SegWit transactions due to their improved efficiency.

Once you have reviewed and confirmed all the transaction details, click on the'Send' or'Confirm' button to initiate the transfer. In some cases, your wallet may require you to enter a password or provide other forms of authentication to complete the transaction. Follow the prompts provided by your wallet to proceed.

After submitting the transaction, your wallet will broadcast it to the Bitcoin network. Miners on the network will include your transaction in a block and confirm it.

The time it takes for confirmation can vary based on network conditions and the fee you included with the transaction. It is advisable to monitor the progress of the transaction within your wallet or by using a blockchain explorer.

Once the transaction is confirmed, the BTC will be successfully sent to the recipient's SegWit address. It is important to note that sending BTC to a SegWit address is irreversible. Therefore, always verify the accuracy of the recipient's address and confirm the transaction details before finalizing the transfer.

By following these steps, you can easily send BTC to a SegWit address and take advantage of the benefits offered by Segregated Witness in the Bitcoin network. Remember to use a compatible wallet, ensure accuracy in address entry, and review all transaction details to ensure a smooth and successful transfer.

By following the necessary steps, users can easily send BTC to a SegWit address. With the compatibility between non-SegWit and SegWit addresses, users can enjoy the efficiency and cost-saving advantages of Segregated Witness in their Bitcoin transactions.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/06/R&AN_7bfe0image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,10.465592,02d83ac9c8cd6c727e5ecb10a4dfbdb5

Material's Indicator revealed that Purple Whales did not stop there and purchased items worth over $50 million.

As seen on the FireCharts CVD, the market data provider also observed a Brown Whale who joined the Bitcoin buying movement with a $2 million purchase order.

Buffinton has observed a significant change in the price of Bitcoin over the past few days. The YouTube presenter noted that Bitcoin rallied from $28,700 to $30,200 before consolidating at $29,800.

However, he believes that a decline to $29,250 and subsequent support would be more favorable for the leading cryptocurrency.

Buffinton also cited the concluding statement of Market Indicators, which attributed the price decline to profit-taking by those who purchased at lower prices.

He advised investors seeking to enter the market to wait until conditions stabilized.

The host of Altcoin Buzz stated that the first Spot Bitcoin Exchange Trust Fund (ETF) in the United States could be authorized before February 2024.

Buffinton cited Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, who cited sources from BlackRock and Invesco. Buffinton quoted Novogratz as stating that the event is significant.

Novogratz relied on sources within BlackRock and Invesco who believe the ETF approval is now a matter of 'when,' not 'if,' with a six-month timeframe.

According to Buffinton, Novogratz Digital Galaxy is among the numerous candidates for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Buffinton believes that the competition for market share among these competitors could increase demand for Bitcoin and serve as a tailwind for the anticipated bull run.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/10/C_2d55eimage_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,8.785679,04913dd5d08ad9598448f3de12e071d6

Using the capital asset pricing model, this article critically assesses the relative importance of computing ‘realized' betas from high-frequency returns for Bitcoin and Ethereum—the two major cryptocurrencies—against their classic counterparts using the 1-day and 5-day return-based betas. The sample includes intraday data from 15 May 2018 until 17 January 2023. The microstructure noise is present until 4 min in the BTC and ETH high-frequency data. Therefore, we opt for a conservative choice with a 60 min sampling frequency. Considering 250 trading days as a rolling-window size, we obtain rolling betas < 1 for Bitcoin and Ethereum with respect to the CRIX market index, which could enhance portfolio diversification (at the expense of maximizing returns). We flag the minimal tracking errors at the hourly and daily frequencies. The dispersion of rolling betas is higher for the weekly frequency and is concentrated towards values of 


β


 > 0.8 for BTC (


β


 > 0.65 for ETH). The weekly frequency is thus revealed as being less precise for capturing the ‘pure' systematic risk for Bitcoin and Ethereum. For Ethereum in particular, the availability of high-frequency data tends to produce, on average, a more reliable inference. In the age of financial data feed immediacy, our results strongly suggest to pension fund managers, hedge fund traders, and investment bankers to include ‘realized' versions of CAPM betas in their dashboard of indicators for portfolio risk estimation. Sensitivity analyses cover jump detection in BTC/ETH high-frequency data (up to 25%). We also include several jump-robust estimators of realized volatility, where realized quadpower volatility prevails.

In digital finance, the econometric study of cryptocurrency price series is experiencing an unprecedented boom. 
Liu and Tsyvinski
 (
2021
) document a significant time-series momentum phenomenon in the cryptocurrency market and show that high investor attention predicts high future returns over the one- to six-week horizons. Bitcoin, in particular, has been the subject of much questioning. Following the methodology by 
Hasbrouck
 (

), 
Baur and Dimpfl
 (
2019
) analyze the trading volume and trading hours of the globally distributed Bitcoin spot market, compared to that of the US-based CBOE/CME futures contracts introduced in December 2017. 
Entrop et al.
 (
2019
) find that medium-sized trades and news-based Bitcoin sentiment contain the most information regarding price discovery on spot and futures markets. 
Alexander et al.
 (
2020
) examine the price discovery and hedging effectiveness of the unregulated derivatives exchange BitMEX. Using minute-by-minute data, the authors demonstrate that BitMEX derivatives lead prices on major Bitcoin spot exchanges by looking primarily at inter-exchange spreads and relative trading volumes. The tumultuous evolution of its market value exemplifies a general trend in cryptocurrency: Bitcoin has the highest financial valuation. Its price has risen sharply in recent years, mainly due to quantitative easing measures adopted by major central banks to address the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. 
Mahdi and Al-Abdulla

2022
) study such impacts of pandemic news on cryptocurrency prices based on quantile-on-quantile regression analysis. The unpredictability and consequent volatility of cryptocurrencies is attracting more and more short-term investors. To address this problem, 
Xie
 (
2019
) proposes Bitcoin forecasting tools based on least squares model averaging. Nevertheless, central bank presidents continue to declare that cryptocurrencies are ‘worthless' and that only a digital currency with the central bank as a guarantor would have a fundamental role in money creation.

This paper seeks to exploit a multiplicative decomposition of the CAPM beta into hourly, daily, and weekly frequencies as a direct extension of previous works by 
Cenesizoglu and Reeves
 (
2018
) and 
González et al.
 (
2018
) with an original application to the two most liquid and largest cryptos by market capitalization (i.e., Bitcoin and Ethereum). The sample includes intraday data from 15 May 2018 until 17 January 2023. This period allows us to explore for the first time the effect of the FTX exchange crash.

 We document that the microstructure noise for BTC/ETH is strongly autocorrelated up to 446 ticks. Visually, the decay occurs after four minutes, which makes our choice of a 60 min sampling frequency in our paper unlikely to be contaminated by the presence of microstructure noise for either BTC or ETH. In particular, the scientific interest of this article consists in tracking at the highest frequency available the ‘pure' CAPM systematic risk of Bitcoin and Ethereum within the methodological framework of 
Hansen et al.
 (
2014
)'s realized betas. We identify the realized GARCH as a very attractive model for capturing volatility persistence better than the GARCH framework and delivering superior predictive ability (especially at a shorter horizon). As robustness checks, we further document the level of risk of Bitcoin and Ethereum should portfolio managers use cryptocurrencies as a diversification tool.
The literature on realized betas was first introduced by 
Bollerslev and Zhang
 (
2003
). 
Andersen et al.
 (
2006
) analyze the dynamics in realized betas, vis-à-vis the dynamics in the underlying realized market variance and individual equity covariances with the market. They highlight the potential for using high-frequency intraday data to capture the continuous evolution in realized betas. 
Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard
 (
2004
) provide a new asymptotic distribution theory for the realized beta. Further works, such as 
Bandi and Russell
 (
2005
) and 
Patton and Verardo
 (
2012
), confirm that extracting information from high-frequency data is very beneficial in time-varying conditional CAPM, compared to the relatively ‘weak' volatility signal captured by closing returns. 
Hollstein et al.
 (
2020
) also document that high-frequency betas provide more accurate predictions of future betas than those based on daily data. 
Hansen et al.
 (
2014
) jointly modeled stock returns and realized measures of their volatility and coined this ‘realized GARCH' (RGARCH). This multivariate volatility model incorporates both GARCH effects and realized measures of variances and covariances. Such a model enables us to consider the price and return information available at intra-day frequency. As individual returns are constructed conditionally based on past and contemporary market variables, extracting the realized betas between the market and the single asset in a dynamic version of the CAPM becomes possible. Indeed, with the realized market variance and realized covariance between the market and the individual stocks in hand, it becomes possible to define and empirically construct the individual equity ‘realized' betas. 
Alexeev et al.
 (
2016
) explored the stability of systematic risk in portfolios of assets on the S&P 500 based on such a decomposition of time-varying betas using high-frequency data.
It is worth noting other attempts to utilize information from realized measures: the GARCH-X (
Engle 2002
) to explain the variation in the realized measures, the multiplicative error model (MEM, 
Engle and Gallo 2006
) to account for additional latent volatility processes for each realized measure, the HEAVY model (
Shephard and Sheppard 2010
) nested with multiple latent volatility processes, and the HYBRID model (
Chen et al. 2011
) to capture intra-daily periodic patterns. Last but not least, 
Brownlees and Gallo
 (
2010
) estimate a restricted MEM model that is closely related to the realized GARCH with the linear specification.
Given the recent advances in collecting information on financial markets (e.g., the potentially heavy burden on the servers to store tick-by-tick data), the exploitation of granular information in high-frequency data constitutes the strongest signal available of latent volatility (
Andersen et al. 2003
). As a consequence, the RGARCH model will be able to capture the dependency over the very short term, which should lead to improvements in the empirical fit (as measured by log-likelihood or information criteria) and also be relevant for forecasting. Applications of the realized GARCH include, to cite a few examples, 
Watanabe
 (
2012
)'s quantile forecasts of financial returns, 
Tian and Hamori
 (
2015
)'s modeling of interest rate volatility, 
Contino and Gerlach
 (
2017
)'s Bayesian tail-risk forecasting, and 
Bonato
 (
2019
)'s work on agricultural commodity markets. Another recent application can be found by 
Doan et al.
 (
2022
) for the DJIA and SPDR ETF.
According to 
Almeida and Gonçalves
 (
2022
)'s bibliometric study, cryptocurrencies do not exhibit adequate hedging ability for the stock market, given that the correlation between stock and cryptocurrency pairs turns out to be positive in most cases. 
Charfeddine et al.
 (
2020
) have also evaluated low levels of hedging effectiveness for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Regarding diversification properties, adding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to an equity portfolio offers diversification benefits for investors compared to a solo equity portfolio (
Matkovskyy et al. 2021
; 
Mensi et al. 2020
). To our knowledge, the diversification properties of Ethereum still need to be assessed in greater depth. During market turbulence, the safe-haven property from gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum is also inconclusive (
Będowska-Sójka and Kliber 2021
). All these considerations lead us to investigate the CAPM betas of Bitcoin and Ethereum with intraday data, which is supposed, in theory, to bring a better measurement of the financial transactions than daily data.
On financial markets, ‘risk' refers only to the possibility of an unwelcome outcome and is traditionally coined as ‘downside risk'. In insurance, ‘pure risks' are all downside (such as the burst of a financial crisis). However, their crucial characteristic is that they remain insurable, which means that investors can transfer the risk to a counterparty (at a cost). As the workhorse portfolio model, the CAPM hypothesizes that unsystematic risk has already been diversified and that the beta is the only remaining measure of systematic risk for a given asset. As an original contribution, this article aims at tracking the ‘pure' systematic risk of Bitcoin and Ethereum thanks to the availability of high-frequency tick data and the measurement of so-called ‘realized' betas. An optimal beta calibration appears to be crucial for asset managers to decide whether to hold or rebalance portfolios, and it can trigger several trading orders to unwind a position. In theory, higher-frequency information should yield more precise estimates (
Andersen 2000
; 
Bollerslev and Wright 2001
). Shorter intervals can also prove more valuable than daily data, particularly when investors need to rebalance their portfolio in the wake of crypto-market crashes such as the recent FTX exchange fallout.
To preview the gist of our results, we report rolling betas inferior to one (on average, 0.80 for Bitcoin and 0.65 for Ethereum) with respect to the CRIX market index, which could help reduce the volatility within this investment universe. Three-dimensional plots reveal a higher dispersion of rolling betas at the weekly frequency. The statistical computation of tracking errors confirms that the two most accurate frequencies are typically found at the hourly and daily levels. Although estimation accuracy varies across assets and timescales, we highlight for Ethereum, in particular, that the availability of high-frequency data tends to produce, on average, a more reliable inference. To ascertain the pivotal role of hedging in risk management (i.e., in the hedge fund or investment bank), we also calculate hedging ratios as proposed by 
Kroner and Sultan
 (
1993
), which seem cheaper overall for Ethereum than for Bitcoin. Last but not least, we compute optimal portfolio holdings and hedging effectiveness.
When dealing with cryptocurrencies, there is indeed high volatility that typically worsens the asset manager's performance. On average, a USD 1 long position in the CRIX can be hedged by going short USD 0.9 on BTC (USD 0.6 on ETH). Optimal weights of cryptocurrencies in the investor portfolio range from 60% to 120% for Bitcoin (−20% to 45% for ETH). Hedging effectiveness is measured by the variance decrease for any hedged portfolio (BTC or ETH) compared with the unhedged portfolio (CRIX). Such a hedging strategy suggests that the inclusion of BTC in the CRIX portfolio ensures, on average, 37% variance reduction. To minimize the risk while keeping the same expected returns, we find that",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Bilel Sanhaji,Chevallier,Julien Chevallier,Sanhaji",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/econometrics/econometrics-11-00019/article_deploy/html/images/econometrics-11-00019-g001-550.jpg?1691644097,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,7.758946,11f43ff5e1d074a257a25a2068af6a35

Revenue for the 3-months and 6-months ended June 30, 2023 was $15.1 million and $27.5 million, respectively ($20.6 million and $34.1 million for the 3-months and 6-months ended June 30, 2022, respectively). Despite a decrease in revenue, gross profits have increased by 13% in the 3 and 6-month periods ending June 30, 2023, when compared to the same periods in 2022.
 
The improved margins are a direct result of more high-margin ATM sales, when compared to the same period last year. The Company recorded a record number of ATM transactions in May 2023, totalling 4,800, which exceeds the previous record of over 4,400 in April 2023.
 
""Late in Q2 2023, we executed additional cost-cutting measures, while yielding improved Gross Profits"" said Luke Thibodeau, CFO ""With steady improvements in operating income over the past 12 months, coupled with the rapid growth of our Online Portal, we've continued to showcase our commitment to the financial success of this business.""
 
Stock Option Repricing
 
Bitcoin Well also announces, subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval, it is repricing 2,198,245 stock options ('Options') held by non-executive employees and consultants. The repricing does not affect the Options' current vesting schedules and does not extend the term of the Options. The 2,198,245 existing Options will be repriced from between $0.107 and $0.18 per common share to $0.05 per common share.
 
Executive Updates
 
Bitcoin Well announces the departure of its Chief Financial Officer, Luke Thibodeau, and extends sincere appreciation for his contributions in shaping the success of the Company over the years. Luke played a significant role in the organization and we are excited to watch him thrive on his new venture abroad.
 
In his place, the Company welcomes back Allen Stephen as Chief Financial Officer. Allen is a seasoned financial leader in the fintech sector who was previously involved in the management of the Company, and currently sits on the Board of Directors.
 
Warrant Issuance 
 
Lastly, Bitcoin Well announces, subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval, the issuance of 7,000,000 common share purchase warrants ('Warrants'), being exercisable into one common share of Bitcoin Well at a price of $0.05 per share for a period of five (5) years from the issuance date. Of the total issuance, 5,400,000 Warrants are being issued to David Bradley, and 1,600,000 Warrants are being issued to Tyler Tollefson (collectively, the 'Holders'), in settlement of any remaining obligations of Bitcoin Well to the Holders.
 
Non-IFRS measures

285,Beyond Bitcoin: YouGov/FranShares Survey Finds Strong Interest in Alternative Assets,FranShares,2023-08-16 00:00:00,date,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/16/2726410/0/en/Beyond-Bitcoin-YouGov-FranShares-Survey-Finds-Strong-Interest-in-Alternative-Assets.html,globenewswire.com,"Millennials, Gen Z gravitate to franchises, farmland and collectibles...","CHICAGO, Aug. 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Younger investors don't expect Lambo money. They're not obsessed with crypto. But they are impatient, and they aren't satisfied with traditional portfolios of stocks and bonds. They're looking for alternatives.
 
Those are some of the conclusions of a new YouGov/FranShares survey on alternative investments such as Bitcoin, NFTs, collectibles, farmland and franchises.
 
The study, conducted from May 5
th
-8
th
 2023, polled 1,008 US investors with $10,000 or more in investable assets (excluding 401Ks). It found high overall awareness of alternatives, with 88% of respondents saying they had either heard of them or invested in them already. More than half of respondents currently invested in alternative assets (53%) said they had increased their portfolio allocation to alternative investments in the past year (i.e., since May 2022).
 
Younger investors (Millennials and Gen Z) led the way in embracing alternative investments. They were also more open to new investment platforms and non-traditional sources of financial guidance than older investors (Gen X and Baby Boomers).
 
Among the findings:
 
Younger investors were even more interested in alternative business assets such as real estate, farmland, venture capital and franchises (84% Gen Z*, 83% Millennials), than in digital assets such as Bitcoin (81% Gen Z*, 80% Millennials) and NFTs (73% Gen Z, 70% Millennials).
Most younger investors (53% Gen Z*, 60% Millennials) said they were aware of and used platforms offering fractional ownership of business investments. Only 19% of Gen X and 2% of Baby Boomer investors said the same.
Younger investors had shorter investment horizons than older ones; the largest group expected to hold assets for 2-5 years (47% Gen Z*, 56% Millennials vs. 30% Gen X, 34% Baby Boomers), whereas the largest group of older investors expected to hold investments for 5 years or more (64% Gen X, 53% Baby Boomers vs. 25% Gen Z*, 24% Millennials).
Almost 1 in 2 (47%) of Gen Z and over 3 in 10 (31%) of Millennials relied on social media to research investments; 9% of Gen X and 2% of Baby Boomer respondents said the same.
Younger investors were more likely to invest in products and services they use (78% Gen Z*, 81% Millennials, 67% Gen X, 42% for Baby Boomers) and use products they invest in (75% Gen Z*, 81% Millennials, 59% Gen X, 39% Baby Boomers).
 
At the same time, younger investors were more conservative than their YOLO reputation would suggest. The largest proportion of younger investors expected returns between 7% and 9% in 2023 (33% Gen Z*, 36% Millennials) — only a bit more than older investors, who expected returns between 4% and 6% (34% Gen X, 43% Baby Boomers).
 
Older investors delivered surprises too. While younger investors were more likely to show interest in alternatives, older investors who are currently invested in alternative assets were more likely to have invested 25% or more of their portfolio allocated in the alternative category in 2022 (30% Gen X*, 23% Baby Boomers*).
 
Respondents gave traditional reasons for considering alternative business investments, including portfolio diversification (42%), strong long-term returns (41%) and passive income (36%).
 
'Squeezed by financial crises, a once-in-a-generation pandemic and a breakdown in traditional institutions, it's no surprise investors are looking beyond stocks and bonds,' said FranShares CEO Kenny Rose. 'Savvy money managers have long known that alternatives like farmland, collectibles and franchises have the potential to deliver returns in good times and bad. Older investors use them to protect against inflation. But the real sea change is coming from tech-savvy younger investors, who are embracing techniques like crowdfunding and fractional ownership to access asset classes — and sources of passive income — that used to be reserved for the 1%.'

287,Bitcoin Earned 98% Of Its Returns In The First Half Of 2023 In Just 8 Trading Days,MENAFN,2023-08-18 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106887012/Bitcoin-Earned-98-Of-Its-Returns-In-The-First-Half-Of-2023-In-Just-8-Trading-Days,menafn.com,"As the first half of the year, when the price volatility in the crypto money markets continued, has passed, a striking report has been published rega","TURKEY - The first half of 2023, in which developments such as the interventions of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bitcoin ETF discussions followed one another in the crypto money markets, which completed 2022 in the shadow of bankruptcies and worsening macroeconomic indicators, has passed. Leading crypto exchange and Web3 technology company OKX, launching its trading and investment solution called Nitro Spreads as of June 2023, has released its first market analysis report to help show that Nitro Spreads facilitates institutional investors to navigate market volatility.

In the aforementioned report, it was found that Bitcoin, which is thought to perform well in 2023, earned almost all of its gains (98%) in just 8 trading days in the 180-day period.

The report states that Bitcoin futures data, including Continuous Swaps, implicit volatility and maturity structure data, was obtained from quantitative analytics data provider Laevitas, while spot price data was obtained from OKX Exchange.

Sharing his assessments on the subject, OKX's Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai said,'We have determined that there are market liquidity and rate of return differences. Cryptocurrency markets, which can respond quickly to many macroeconomic developments, regularly announced economic data, and regulations faced by companies, follow a fluctuating and volatile course for all these reasons. Our findings underscore again how difficult it is to predict the timing of steady gains in such a volatile environment.'

Expressing that their report focuses on examining the difficulties of long delta transactions in the current crypto market and determining how experienced institutional investors can follow market-independent strategies in a horizontal market, Lennix Lai said,'We see that more and more institutional investors are following market-independent strategies. As OKX, we offer various tools to cryptocurrency traders so that they can perform transactions in accordance with their strategies and be successful in different market conditions. Our tool called Buy-Sell Strategy (Nitro Spreads) is one of them. OKX Nitro Spreads executes two parts of the transaction through a central order book, making it possible to complete complex base trades efficiently with one click.'

Emphasizing that the Buy-Sell Strategy product, which they launched in beta at the end of June, is a buy-sell difference transactions solution that eliminates the risk of parts between crypto markets, OKX's Commercial Operations Manager Lennix Lai concluded his evaluations with the following statements:

'Institutional investors using this tool can execute a two-part base trade with one click. Market-independent strategies, such as spreads, can reduce the risks associated with sudden market movements and offer investors a balanced trading approach to achieve stable returns. This tool, which can be used by institutional investors applying for early access, provides VIP users with advantages such as 50% lower transaction fee, lower realization risk and higher capital efficiency.'

As OKX, which reached a transaction volume of over 1 billion dollars in the liquid market in the first quarter of 2023, and tripled this figure in its total transaction volume as of the end of July, we aim to develop solutions for both individual and institutional investors to properly evaluate their savings and to value the value these solutions provide to the market and our users. We will continue to share with transparency.

The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (the 'ETF') represents the first digital asset fund compliant with SFDR Article 8 through its decarbonisation strategy. Jacobi has implemented a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution which allows institutional investors to access the benefits of Bitcoin whilst also meeting ESG goals.

The ETF, regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), trades under the ticker BCOIN. Custodial services are provided by Fidelity Digital AssetsSM, with Flow Traders operating as market makers and Jane Street and DRW as Authorised Participants. Fund benchmark, the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index, is provided by Wilshire Indexes with the REC solution created in collaboration with digital asset platform, Zumo.

CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, Martin Bednall said: 'It is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe, secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF. Unlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying asset directly. Jacobi is proud to be supported by Tier1 partners at the forefront of this digital asset market evolution whilst also pioneering an innovative, environmentally sound solution for European investors.'

Mark Makepeace, CEO of Wilshire Indexes, added: 'The launch of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is an important milestone for the digital asset industry and a transformative moment for the global financial industry. We are excited about the partnership with Jacobi and, as a leader in the development of institutional grade digital asset benchmarks, we are committed to helping accelerate the advancement of the entire digital asset ecosystem.'

The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF offers an ESG-aligned digital asset solution where environmentally conscious ETF buyers can consider Bitcoin within their investment portfolio, as well as independently audit the environmental claims. Jacobi's solution differs from carbon offsetting products by quantifying the electricity consumption attributable to Bitcoin in the ETF and purchasing equivalent RECs, the standardised instrument for procuring clean power. This provides digital proof of RECs, transparently recorded on a blockchain.

Kirsteen Harrison, Environmental Manager, Zumo, commented: ""The decarbonisation of crypto is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nascent digital assets sector, and there is increasing pressure on all businesses to have credible plans to decarbonise. We've been working closely with Jacobi Asset Management to help them build out an ESG-aligned, future-proofed crypto offering for their customers. It's hugely exciting to see it come to life in the shape of Europe's first Bitcoin ETF. We're creating the investment products of tomorrow - what a moment for the industry.""

Emanuel van Praag, lawyer at Kennedy Van der Laan, commented: 'We are proud to have provided legal counsel to Jacobi AM in its listing of the first SFDR Article 8 digital assets fund.'",businesswire.com,252,news,US,en,,https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20230815404630/en/1866372/23/Web_Photo_Editor-4.jpg,False,@businesswire,6.5076823,deea644a5c594e0cf3b7622266371382

Bitcoin Depot Inc.
 ('Bitcoin Depot' or the 'Company'), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today announced, it was recognized for the fourth year in a row by Inc. as one of the fastest growing private companies in America at number 697 on the prestigious 
Inc 5000 list
.
 
The Inc. 5000 class of 2023 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges.
 
'We're honored and gratified to be recognized on the Inc. 5000 list for a fourth year in a row,' said Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz. 'Our placement speaks to the incredible growth Bitcoin Depot saw in 2022 and signals an exciting future for us as a publicly traded company. In the last year, we weathered a tumultuous crypto market, successfully closed our business combination, rang the Nasdaq opening bell, and expanded our services into additional markets through significant retail partnerships. As we continue our mission of bringing crypto to the masses, we look forward to servicing our new and returning customers with the steadfast innovation and commitment they've counted on us for since day one.'
 
The Inc 5000 inclusion comes shortly after Bitcoin Depot closed its business combination with GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp and associated listing of Bitcoin Depot's common stock and warrants on NASDAQ under the symbols 'BTM' and 'BTMWW', respectively, which occurred on July 3, 2023.
 
'Running a business has only gotten harder since the end of the pandemic,' says Inc. Editor-In-Chief Scott Omelianuk. 'To make the Inc. 5000—with the fast growth that requires—is truly an accomplishment. Inc. is thrilled to honor the companies that are building our future.'

eth/usd and btc/usd are approaching major support levels. what is the outlook and what are the key levels to watch?

bitcoin's fall below key converged support around 27300-27800 has confirmed that the bullish pressure from last year has faded. the support includes the lower edge of the ichimoku cloud on the daily charts and a rising channel since early 2023.

this follows a failed attempt to cross above the converged barrier at the april high of around 31000, coinciding with the 89-week moving average and the upper edge of the ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart. for more discussion, see'bitcoin & ethereum hold ground ahead of us cpi: btc/usd & eth/usd price setups ,' published august 10.

while the fall below 27300-27800 has disrupted the uptrend for now, it is not sufficient to suggest an end of the uptrend. only a break below the june low of 24750 would trigger a reassessment of the overall bullish bias.any break below 24750 would trigger a double top (the april and july highs), pointing to a deeper retracement toward the march low of 19550.

ethereum looks relatively weaker than bitcoin. that's because eth/usd created a lower high (relative to its own peak in april) compared with btc/usd which in july briefly surpassed its april high.

eth/usd dropped below an important converged support on the 200-day moving average and a rising trendline since the end of 2022, confirming that the multi-week upward pressure has dissipated. ethereum is now testing major support at the june low of 1620. any break below would raise the odds that the uptrend from the end of last year had ended, pointing to a broad trading range of 1300-2000 subsequently for eth/usd. the next support is the march low of 1370.

After weeks of listless trade and low turnover, volatility returned to the cryptocurrency market with a bang Thursday when the market slumped in minutes with little in the way of support seen to stem the fall. bitcoin went into freefall and hit a multi-month low of $25,166 before making a minor recovery, while Ethereum slumped to $1,543 from a daily high print of $1,807. The market is awash with reasons behind the sharp selloff. Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for bankruptcy protection in New York yesterday, highlighting ongoing fears in China's property market, while this week's hawkish fomc outtake sent longer-dated US bond yields back to multi-month and multi-year highs.

The daily chart shows that Bitcoin is in extremely oversold territory and is below all three moving averages. BTC/usd has recovered some of yesterday's damage but will need a period of consolidation before attempting to push any higher. Whether yesterday's $25,166 print marks a short-term low is difficult to qualify after the latest burst of volatility.

The ETH/USD chart is very similar to the BTC/USD chart – heavily oversold but negative while still below all three simple moving averages.

Looking ahead, continued volatility remains likely with news expected shortly over whether the SEC will approve the first Ethereum futures-based ETF. Any news, positive or negative, from the SEC, will further stoke short-term volatility in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The SEC is also under the spotlight after Grayscale took the regulators to court last June over the SEC's refusal to allow the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to change into a cash Bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades at a heavy discount to the Bitcoin they hold and the company is looking to close this gap. A ruling is imminent and again is likely to shift the market.

Next week sees the yearly central banker annual meet up at Jackson Hole Symposium. The three-day event titled 'Structural Shifts in the Global Economy' features a raft of central bank heads and policymakers, and Fed chair Jerome Powell is expected to make a keynote speech. The latest FOMC minutes had a distinctly hawkish overtone and chair Powell may use next week's platform to reiterate the Fed's fight against inflation is not close to being over.

the fbi cautioned crypto companies that the movement of funds linked to the notorious north korean hacking group could be an indication that the hackers are preparing to sell.

the federal investigation agency advised crypto companies to keep an eye out for the six btc wallets and to use blockchain data to monitor any fund transfers.

the north korean cyber group has participated in multiple crypto-related exploits over the years, stealing crypto assets worth billions of dollars.

according to a recent report by trm labs, north korean hackers have seized nearly $2 billion in cryptocurrency since 2018. the group was at its most active in 2022, stealing nearly $1 billion worth of crypto assets.

lazarus group was identified as the mastermind behind harmony's horizon bridge and sky mavis' $625 million attack on the ethereum-linked sidechain ronin bridge in 2022.

despite an increase in crypto-linked exploits due to code vulnerabilities in platforms and protocols as a result of the sophistication of these hackers' methods, the public ledger of blockchain technology makes it difficult for exploiters to launder or transfer their illicit gains.

multiple times in the past, law enforcement agencies such as the fbi and crypto companies have collaborated to block funds associated with such exploits.

in early february of this year, huobi and binance froze crypto assets worth $1.4 million attributed to north korea. similarly, crypto exchanges suspended $63 million worth of assets related to the harmony bridge hack.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/23/C_9ab47image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,9.063781,63c832e6d54502d93669afdc32bc4f31

'Amid everyone proclaiming, 'Ordinals are dead,' they account for 84.9% of Bitcoin activity,' he said.

The trend is supported by data from Dune Analytics, which indicates that there were over 400,000 ordinal inscriptions on August 20, while Bitinfocharts reports a daily bitcoin transaction count of approximately 556,000.

This indicates that on August 20, more than three-quarters of the present network activity was related to ordinals. Eric Wall, an industry researcher, added that during the past week, 54% of Bitcoin network transactions were ordinary.

According to Dune, there have been 25.5 million ordinary inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, generating $53.4 million in fees.

Inscriptions are presently dominated by the creation of BRC-20 tokens, with 1.9 million created last week.

However, the report only monitored the sales and trading volume of NFTs issued on the Bitcoin network, not the actual inscription activity, which appears to remain high.

Bitcoin ordinals are nonfungible asset artifacts that permit the inscription of data onto Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.

Financial markets are complex, evolving dynamic systems. Due to their irregularity, financial time series forecasting is regarded as a rather challenging task. In recent years, artificial neural network applications in finance for such tasks as pattern recognition, classification, and time series forecasting have dramatically increased. The objective of this paper is to present this versatile framework and attempt to use it to predict the stock return series of four public-listed companies on the New York Stock Exchange. Our findings coincide with those of Burton Malkiel in his book, 
A Random Walk Down Wall Street
; no conclusive evidence is found that our proposed models can predict the stock return series better than that of a random walk.

301,Bitcoin's Price Drop Triggers Fear As Halving Date Approaches,MENAFN,2023-08-21 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106908835/Bitcoins-Price-Drop-Triggers-Fear-As-Halving-Date-Approaches,menafn.com,"The Bitcoin Fear and Greed index has reached 38, moving from neutral into the fear zone. The change occurred after the foremost digital currency los","Following fear is extreme fear, which may signal a purchasing opportunity because investors will be terrified.

Once Bitcoin enters the opposite zone of greed, it is possible that a price correction will occur.

In the final days of the previous week, the Bitcoin price dropped from just under $30,000 on Thursday to the $25,800 region, a loss of 11.18 percent.

On Friday, Bitcoin fell 8% in minutes after false reports that Elon Musk's SpaceX company was selling BTC worth $373 million.

Benjamin Cowen, a crypto analyst, believes that such massive drops below the bull market support bank (BMSB) are customary for Bitcoin as the halving date approaches.

According to Cowen, the next halving (or'halvening') will occur in April–May 2024, and the price of bitcoin has fallen . The BTC price decline in August coincided with a 5% decline in the S&P 500 index.

The mining rewards for cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-work consensus algorithm are reduced by half every four years.

If they currently earn 6.25 BTC (approximately $188,876) for each newly mined block, they will earn 3.125 BTC (roughly $94,438) after May 2024.

This year, two other PoW coins, Dash (DASH) and Litecoin (LTC), underwent a halving. Typically, halving a cryptocurrency's supply increases its scarcity, causing the price to rise.

In April and October of 2021, Bitcoin reached two new all-time highs, with the second occurring near $69,000.

Many believe, however, that it was not the mining itself that occurred in 2020 that drove the price of BTC to a new all-time high.

Due to the pandemic in early 2020, the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan began printing money for corporate subsidies and population support during the quarantine period.

Over $6 trillion was printed for rescues and $1,200 for'survival checks' in the united states alone .

Since then, printing has persisted, and this year, after several central U.S. banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, failed, the U.S. government bailed out Silicon Valley Bank by printing more U.S. dollars for that purpose.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/21/C_d7c0cimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.68565,70fd2be6ea5618c2130483ac50c6a6aa

Bitcoin staged a remarkable and vigorrally on Tuesday, jumping more than 7% and breaking above its 200-day simple moving average handily, propelled by a pivotal and game-changing legal development in the U.S. legal system that promises to reshape the landscape of digital tokens.

In a significant turn of events, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was wrong in denying investment giant Grayscale's request to convert its popular bitcoin trust GBTC into an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), asserting that the decision was'arbitrary and capricious'.

The legal saga had its origins in 2022 when the SEC, under the leadership of Gary Gensler, was sued for blocking Grayscale's application to list an ETF that tracks the price of bitcoin on the basis that spot transactions in this asset were unregulated and subject to market manipulation.

While the SEC may explore avenues to overturn the judgment, such as appealing to the Supreme Court or seeking a rehearing, it is unclear if it will do so. For now, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain, but should Grayscale prevail, the federal regulator may be forced to revisit its earlier verdict and possibly greenlight the original petition, paving the way for the first crypto ETF.

We will have more information soon to better assess the outlook for the cryptocurrency realm. In the meantime, it would not be surprising to see a growing wave of positive sentiment fostered by speculation that the court system would curtail stringent government regulations within the space. This could amplify BTC/USD's upside, boosting its recovery heading into September.

After Tuesday's powerful rally, Bitcoin recaptured its 200-day simple moving average and cleared a key ceiling at $27,500. If this bullish breakout is sustained, buying interest could gather pace upcoming trading sessions, setting the stage for a move to $28,500, followed by $29,000. On further strength, a retest of the $30,000 becomes likely.

On the flip side, if sellers return to the market and spark a bearish reversal, initial support appears at $27,500 and $25,800 thereafter. Further down the line, attention shifts to the August lows, situated just a touch above the psychological $25,000 level.

Increases hashrate to 5.6 EH/s -
 
- Upgrades Magog farm with installation of high efficiency miners -
 
This news release constitutes a 'designated news release' for purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated August 16, 2021, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated August 12, 2021.
 
TORONTO, Ontario and BROSSARD, Québec, Sept. 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (
NASDAQ: BITF//TSX: BITF
), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company, provides a Bitcoin (BTC) production and mining operations update for August 2023.
 
'In August, we powered up new miners and continued to optimize the fleet at several locations, driving our hashrate up to 5.6 EH/s,' said Geoff Morphy, CEO of Bitfarms. 'At Baie-Comeau, Québec, our newest production facility ran smoothly at around 5 MW throughout the month, and we completed the racking of all miners re-deployed there. The remaining step to reach 11 MW of production at Baie-Comeau is to energize the 6 MW power line, which we expect to be completed in September. This, in conjunction with final miner installations in Rio Cuarto, Argentina, supports our ability to achieve our target hashrate of 6.3 EH/s by the end of September 2023.'
 
'In Paso Pe, Paraguay, we started our expansion with the purchase of 1,920 MicroBT M53S+ hydro-cooling miners and 20 MW of associated specialized containers. We plan to construct a 50 MW substation to power a 30 MW air-cooled warehouse contiguous with these containers. With long lead time items, such as the primary transformer, on order and our groundbreaking planned for September 2023, we are targeting the 50 MW to be fully commissioned in Q1 2024,' added Morphy.
 
Ben Gagnon, Chief Mining Officer of Bitfarms, said, 'In August 2023, BTC production was 383, an increase of 1.3% in July 2023 despite a 6.3% network difficulty increase during August. Miner deployments and more moderate weather in Quebec and Washington also improved production conditions in the second half of August as our average EH/s climbed from 4.7 EH/s in the first 15 days of August to 5.5 EH/s in the latter 16 days of August.'
 
'Focusing on continuous improvement and capital efficiency, we completed our Magog farm upgrade with the installation of 2,862 S19J Pro+ miners. With a price of $13.00/TH, or only 46% of the cost of higher efficiency XP miners, the S19J Pro+ miners deliver 85% of the hashrate. With this upgrade, energy efficiency, which includes the energy needs of all supplementary equipment such as fans, lights and networking hardware, improved from 45 w/TH to 28 w/TH at Magog and from 38 w/TH to 37 w/TH across our entire portfolio,' concluded Gagnon.
 
Mining Review 
 
August production of 383 BTC was 1.3% higher than the 378 BTC mined in July due to increased corporate capacity and more moderate weather facilitating greater uptimes.
 
Network difficulty increased 6.3% in August, compared to July, as Bitcoin miners continue to invest in capacity in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices. Year-to-date through the end of August, difficulty increased 57.3% while the BTC price was up roughly 64.4%, resulting in a 6.5% improvement in mining economics as measured by USD/TH/day.

Introduction to Bitcoin Wallets


What Is a Bitcoin Wallet?


Bitcoin wallets are software applications or hardware devices used to store Bitcoin. Instead of storing hard currency, Bitcoin wallets store the private keys needed to send or receive cryptocurrency.
 


Bitcoin wallets can be hardware devices similar to USB sticks, or they can be digital apps accessed on a smartphone or other device. 


Importance of Bitcoin Wallets


Because there is no physical Bitcoin, digital access to the cryptocurrency must be stored in some form of wallet. Anyone with access to a wallet's private keys — a long series of alphanumeric characters — has access to all the cryptocurrency stored using the wallet. While the Bitcoin 
blockchain
 is extremely secure, a crypto owner's stake is only as secure as the private key and the wallet in which it's stored. 


Understanding Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets


Crypto wallets
 help Bitcoin users interact with the blockchain network, and there are several different types of wallets. Bitcoin wallets are broken into two main categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets, or Bitcoin wallets connected to the internet, typically make it faster and easier for users to trade and spend their Bitcoin. Cold wallets, or wallets not connected to the internet, are more secure compared to hot wallets, but they typically make it more difficult for users to use their Bitcoin. 


Hardware Wallet


Hardware wallets are physical, cold storage devices that keep a Bitcoin user's private keys safe and offline. Hardware wallets are generally extremely secure compared to hot wallets because hackers and cybercriminals do not have access to cold wallets. However, hardware wallets can be lost or stolen in the physical world, just like a traditional wallet. 


Desktop Wallet


A desktop wallet allows Bitcoin users to store and manage private keys securely on a personal computer hard drive. A user simply downloads desktop wallet software and installs it on their PC just like you would install any other application. Desktop wallets are typically hot wallets and can be ideal for Bitcoin users who often make crypto transactions on a PC. However, they are less secure than hardware wallets. 


Web Wallet


Web wallets are hot wallets that store a user's private keys on a server, and users can access them as long as they have access to the internet. Web wallets are controlled by a 
cryptocurrency exchange
 or other third-party entity, and users access them by signing in using an ID and password or other means of identification. Web wallets can be extremely convenient, but they are only as secure as the third party managing them. 


Mobile Wallet


A mobile Bitcoin wallet is an app that stores private keys on a smartphone, allowing users to easily use or trade crypto on the go. Mobile wallets are hot wallets, and they come with all the risks associated with malware or other cyberattacks. However, mobile wallets can be extremely convenient for using crypto as a payment method, including via QR code scans. 


Paper Wallet


Paper wallets are cold storage wallets that are created using a key generator program that prints public and private key pairs used to make crypto transactions. Once these keys are printed, the paper wallet is essentially akin to paper fiat currency. If your paper wallet is lost or stolen, the funds in it are gone just like a stolen $20 bill. Paper wallets were once the preferred method of cold storage in the crypto community, but they have now largely been replaced by hardware wallets.

Top 5 Best Bitcoin Wallets


There are many different brands of Bitcoin wallets, and each has its unique pros and cons based on the type of wallet it is, the features it offers and its price. 


Hardware Wallet: Trezor


Trezor wallets are known for their advanced security features, such as Shamir Backup for lost, broken or stolen devices. Trezor wallets are also very affordable, starting at only $69 for the Trezor Model One. In addition to Bitcoin, Trezor wallets support roughly 1,000 other popular cryptos as well, including 
Ethereum
, Cardano and Solana. 


Desktop Wallet: Exodus Wallet


Exodus Wallet is a user-friendly hot storage wallet that is known for its functionality. In addition to its desktop wallet, Exodus users can access their wallets via mobile devices and web extensions. Exodus is also free to use, but critics have pointed out it doesn't have as many security features as other leading wallets. 


Web Wallet: Coinbase Wallet


Coinbase Global Inc. (ticker: 
COIN
) operates one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and its Coinbase Wallet web wallet is one of three crypto wallets it offers to its users. Coinbase Wallet does not offer a desktop application, but its simple, highly functional mobile app and web browser extension support thousands of digital assets, including 
non-fungible tokens
. In addition, Coinbase Wallet allows staking directly from the wallet, and its compatibility with Ledger — another wallet brand — allows users to easily transition from hot storage to cold storage. 


Mobile Wallet: Trust Wallet


Trust Wallet is a popular mobile Bitcoin wallet that has millions of users, supports more than 4.5 million tokens and can interact with 65 different blockchain networks. Trust Wallet is also the official digital wallet of Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Trust Wallet has an intuitive interface and built-in staking capabilities, but it does not have a cold storage feature. 


Paper Wallet: BitAddress


BitAddress is a popular crypto platform that generates paper wallets for Bitcoin. BitAddress users can quickly and easily print out paper wallets with private and public keys that can used to securely store their Bitcoin offline. BitAddress paper wallets are convenient for new crypto users or users who do not trust digital storage, but they can be easily lost or stolen and are generally considered inferior to other modern cold storage methods. 


The Security Aspect of Bitcoin Wallets


The decentralized nature of blockchain networks promises users an unprecedented level of security when it comes to verifying and securing cryptocurrency transactions. However, while the Bitcoin blockchain network itself is extremely secure, a Bitcoin user's cryptocurrency is only as secure as the wallet in which it is stored. Many cryptocurrency wallets use advanced security features to protect their contents, including multifactor authentication, multi-signature and seed phrase security. 


Improving Your Wallet's Security


There's no way to make a Bitcoin wallet 100% safe and secure, but there are plenty of steps to improve security and minimize risk. Cold storage eliminates the possibility of hacking or online access to your wallet. In addition, Bitcoin users should always use only reputable wallet providers that prioritize security features, and they should regularly change their wallet passwords. 


Contingency Plans for Wallet Security


No matter how many security features your wallet has, loss, theft or even personal incapacitation can have severe consequences when it comes to accessing your Bitcoin holdings. Well before you forget or lose access to a crypto wallet, you should clearly document how to access private keys or backups and record the specifics of the recovery process along with instructions on how to use any recovery tools. If you become unable to manage your wallet or forget what to do when you lose access, a contingency plan can help you or a close, trusted friend or family member recover your crypto assets. 


How to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet


Much like cryptocurrencies themselves, identifying the best cryptocurrency wallets largely involves weighing a trade-off between security and convenience. Individual investors will have different levels of risk aversion and different goals in mind for their Bitcoin that will influence their wallet priorities. In addition, users should consider the features different wallets offer, the usability of the wallets based on their level of experience and the costs or fees involved. 


Takeaway


There's no such thing as a 'best' Bitcoin wallet for the masses, but there's likely a best wallet for you, your level of activity and your risk tolerance. Plus, there are a handful of rules of thumb any Bitcoin investor should keep in mind when choosing a Bitcoin wallet. Consider which devices you plan on using to access your Bitcoin, as well as what types of transactions you will be making and how often you will be making them. Finally, read online reviews from experts and other users to ensure your wallet of choice is reputable and reliable.

314,Bitcoin Etfs Are An Inevitability And Will Drive Crypto Prices,MENAFN,2023-08-30 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1106988070/Bitcoin-Etfs-Are-An-Inevitability-And-Will-Drive-Crypto-Prices,menafn.com,"Bitcoin ETFs are'an inevitability', which will send the price of the cryptocurrency soaring, predicts the CEO of one of the world's largest independ","The bullish assessment from deVere Group CEO – and long-time crypto advocate – Nigel Green, comes as theCourt of Appeals sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which had rejected the company's application to convert the

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust

to an ETF.



Spot ETFs invest directly in underlying assets, typically stocks or bonds, at the current market price (spot price). They aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or asset class by holding a portfolio of the actual securities that make up the index.

Mr Green says:'This is a landmark legal win for crypto against theregulator.

'The court's decision destroys the SEC's central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years.

'This win paves the way for Bitcoin ETFs .

'Following the monumental ruling, there's very little chance now the SEC will block the launch of ETFs.

'A swathe of big-name asset managers, among others, have filed ETF applications for Bitcoin ETFs and we expect that the SEC will organise a block approval of applications that meet requirements, as it will not want to be seen as a kingmaker.

'We believe that Bitcoin ETFs are now an inevitability. And they could come to market sooner than many anticipate.'

The deVere chief executive believes that the price of crypto will jump if/when Bitcoin ETFs are launched for three reasons.

'First, if Bitcoin ETFs are approved, it would open up the cryptocurrency market to a broader range of investors who might have been hesitant to directly invest in digital assets. This influx of new capital from institutional and retail investors could drive up demand for Bitcoin, leading to an increase in its price.

'Second, ETFs typically involve the purchase of the underlying asset by the fund managers. If Bitcoin ETFs follow this structure, it could create a substantial demand for actual Bitcoins to back the ETF shares. This increased demand, coupled with the limited supply of Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), could lead to a supply-demand imbalance, resulting in a price surge.

'And third, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs might improve the overall perception of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of regulators and traditional financial institutions. This increased legitimacy could attract more conservative investors who were previously wary of the regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies. As more institutional money flows into the market through ETFs, the price of Bitcoin would experience upward pressure.'

deVere expects that the first Bitcoin ETFs will be available in Quarter 1 of 2024'if not before.'

Nigel Green concludes:'In-the-know investors are unlikely to wait until the potential launch of the ETFs to increase their holdings of Bitcoin.'

The SEC's failure to provide clear, transparent explanations for selectively rejecting and approving materially similar bitcoin-based financial products has created frustration and confusion in the industry, while stagnating growth and innovation.

The ruling will put new pressure on the SEC to be transparent in sharing coherent explanations on its approval process, and help pave the way for products that will make bitcoin accessible to mainstream investors. Bitcoin 's price rally on the news suggests that investors are pricing in this development as a vote of confidence in upcoming bitcoin ETF approvals and a stronger, more transparent regulatory environment.

Why do they prefer alternat,"(MENAFN- GETX LOCAL SRL)

The Bank of America ran a study concluding that 47% of wealthy young investors questioned their digital currencies. Why do they prefer alternative assets? It seems that 75% of them don't trust traditional commodities such as bonds and stocks to generate a profit. In comparison, they're interested in how to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they have more faith in them to perform well in the long run. Young investors believe that blockchain technology and the digital asset space will provide the best growth opportunities in the future. One of the reasons why they feel comfortable investing in volatile assets is they have a long time to wait before retiring, so they can adjust their portfolios along the way.

Bitcoin is one of the main assets that are making their way into young investors' portfolios. Research shows that Gen Z adults and millennials view investing in digital currencies and NFTs as a great retirement strategy. However, beyond retirement plans, young investors are more comfortable buying digital assets like Bitcoin because they grew in the digital age.

Why do young investors prefer buying Bitcoin instead of traditional commodities?

Bitcoin is the oldest and most volatile cryptocurrency, but this characteristic doesn't scare off young investors who prefer investing their funds into innovative digital solutions. According to studies, most Bitcoin investors are young individuals because 50% of millennials admit they trust blockchain technology more than the stock market.

At the moment, investors worldwide debate about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as future investments or fads. Still, Gen Z adults and millennials continue to purchase virtual currencies, even during bear markets.

Young people are tech-savvy, and Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology

Seasoned investors doubt diversifying their portfolios using cryptocurrencies because they have enjoyed living in an economically stable environment for a long time. However, young investors have always dealt with insecurity regarding their finances and feel more comfortable putting their savings into a risky asset. Gen Z-ers and Millennials have also grown up using the Internet, smart devices, and having access to information. The older generation doesn't know much about the Internet, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies, but young investors are technologically literate and trust the digital world.

Seasoned investors find it challenging to trust assets based on technology because they have lived in a different world. But younger ones are quick to embrace anything technology puts to the table because they believe that the digital world is the future. Bitcoin was built using blockchain technology which is thought to revolutionize all industries, so young investors see it as the ideal investment.

Bitcoin is a social asset

Young people have been using social media platforms since they were children, so they are used to interacting with other people via these platforms. Bitcoin was developed with peer-to-peer technology, which enables crypto users to transfer funds without involving third parties, banks, or the authorities. Therefore, they classify Bitcoin as a social innovation because it prevents intermediaries from getting a hold of their money. They believe that blockchain technology is a solution that will revolutionize how people share value online and do business.

Bitcoin relies on a network of computers to establish and maintain data. Blockchain technology functions like a public ledger that records all transactions and grants users access to all data. The system is one of the most secure ever created because no one can interfere with the data, so counterfeiting is impossible. Investors access a system that allows them to transfer value or funds without the involvement of a third party. Bitcoin is usually considered a social innovation able to change the way individual and institutional investors share value.

Young investors aren't afraid to take risks

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin and all blockchain-based currencies are highly volatile assets. Therefore, their prices swing constantly, and they can lead to significant gains or losses. However, the increased volatility doesn't deter Gen Z and Millennial investors from buying Bitcoin because their behavioral psychology makes them risk-takers.

Seasoned investors are more fearful when it comes to diversifying their portfolios with Bitcoin or other digital assets because the desire to take risks reduces as people get older. Therefore, the investors' age is one of the reasons why Gen Z-ers and Millennials are more willing to buy Bitcoin even if its value dropped during the bear market. Additionally, many young individuals believe that the virtual world offers the ideal opportunity to make a decent income, so they won't miss out if their friends have already joined the trend.

Young investors don't trust traditional financial institutions

Even if they're young, Gen Z-ers and millennials have witnessed more than one economic difficulty and financial recession. And even if they didn't feel their effects directly, they have grown up hearing from their parents how challenging it was for them to pay for their daily expenses. This led them to no longer trust the traditional financial institutions because they considered them responsible for these events. If, in the past, people could make a passive income from leaving their money in the bank, this is no longer the case. The youth understand that traditional financial institutions lack reliability these days and are more proactive in building their wealth.

Digital currencies like Bitcoin are decentralized in nature, so they are better solutions for the younger generations because they want to stay away from centralized and highly regulated institutions.

Bitcoin is easily accessible

To invest in traditional assets, people need to learn to manage a brokerage account, take part in trades, and learn how all commodities are tied to silver and gold resources. This could prove challenging for young investors who lack knowledge about traditional assets. On the other hand, buying Bitcoin or other digital assets is more straightforward and makes more sense to them because they have grown up in the digital age.

Final words

The bottom line is that young investors prefer digital commodities like Bitcoin because it grants them more exposure to innovative technologies that are more likely to drive profit in the future.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/30/pr_15975_533e3205_image_story.png,False,@menafn,8.048784,9c1017df6cbeba677d802592b7c5693f

Consistent with his skepticism of the government, the conservative businessperson asserts that Washington's'shadow government' operates without restraint.

According to the entrepreneur, federal courts are the last line of defense against'illegal rogue actions' by government agencies whose names are abbreviated. In the case of Grayscale, the court's ruling validated this position.

In a Wednesday tweet, Ramaswamy stated,'This decision is strong and clears the way for Bitcoin and blockchain innovation to remain in the United States. However, this matter never should have reached the courts in the first instance.

Grayscale alleged in its lawsuit that the SEC approved other Bitcoin products, such as futures ETFs, despite having no grounds for rejecting spot Bitcoin ETFs.

According to Vivek, in recent months, courts have sided with the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to finding the SEC's rejection of Grayscale's ETF to be'arbitrary and capricious,' the legal system sided with Ripple in July.

In addition, the court ruled that XRP does not constitute a security. Vivek's observations align with the sentiments expressed by numercryptocurrency industry leaders.

They have repeatedly cautioned against the SEC's'regulation by enforcement' approach, emphasizing that it could cause crypto businesses and innovators to seek out more favorable environments abroad.

These views parallel those expressed by a group of Republican congressmen who support cryptocurrencies. Some of these congressmen have publicly demanded that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler be removed from his position.

In an April exchange with Gensler, Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) referred to him as an'incompetent beat cop. Emmer implied that his actions could inadvertently drive the crypto industry into communist China.

Vivek, like Coinbase and other exchanges , emphasizes the need for more regulatory clarity. Vivek has demonstrated his support for Bitcoin in a very vocal manner.

Hash price is cents away from November 2022 levels.,"Bitcoin miners are churning less in revenue, looking at trackers on August 28. According to Hashrate Index 
data
, a platform that tracks the correlation between hash rate and revenue accrued by miners over time, income generated from Bitcoin mining operations is at near record lows.


Bitcoin Miner Revenue Declining


At $0.059 per Tera Hash (TH) daily, the trend doesn't look exciting for Bitcoin miners as it is cents away from $0.056, a level recorded in late November 2022. 


At the depth of last year's crypto winter when prices fell, cracking below $16,000, hash price, which measures the potential revenue expected from deploying 1 Tera Hash of hash rate to the Bitcoin network per day, crumbled to the lowest point in three years.

BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView


While BTC supporters are optimistic, expecting prices to recover in the second half of 2023, miners must contend with lower revenue. How this impacts their operations is yet to be seen because miners depend on income generated from deploying hash rate to cater for operational expenses and sometimes pay shareholders. 


Bitcoin Hash Price: Hashrate Index


On May 8, the hash price rose to $0.095, the highest level in 2023, but has since contracted, dropping by over 40%. As the hash price falls, it could mean miners are having a hard time competing. The trend, as it is visible, comes when the hash rate has been rising to record levels as more miners power up their mining rigs. 
 
Throughout 2023, the total Bitcoin hash rate, a metric measuring the computing power channeled to the network, 
rose
 from 269 EH/s in early January 2023 to 465 EH/s in early July 2023. The hash rate has since dropped around 329 EH/s, a level that's still higher than 2022 highs. 


Bitcoin Hash Rate: Bitinfocharts


More Rigs, Higher Hash Rate


With a rising hash rate, the Bitcoin network automatically adjusted the mining difficulty to the highest level last week. Trackers 
show
 the network's difficulty is now at 55.62 T, following a 6% increment. 


For the better part of the year, difficulty levels have been rising amid an increase in hash rate. As prices recovered in January and the hash rate rose, the network increased difficulty levels by 10%, the highest spike this year.
 
Hash rate will likely continue rising in the months ahead. Tether Energy, an affiliate of Tether Holdings, issues USDT, 
plans
 to connect their rigs in Latin America. Their launch translates to more competition for existing miners, including Riot Blockchain.

The price retraced below the $26k level, but it has been a different story for Bitcoin clone derivative coins.

Bitcoin Price at 2011 Levels Returns as Bitcoin BSC Coin Launch Provides Chance to Earn Free Bitcoin Clone Tokens

During the past three months, for example, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork from Bitcoin is up 73%, while Bitcoin has fallen -2.3% in the same time period.

Meanwhile, a similar staking-based bitcoin derivative coin to Bitcoin BSC, BTC20 , which launched a month ago, is up 52%.

In fact, BTC20 hit an all-time (ATH) intraday high of $6, equating to a 688% 7x gain on its $1 presale and listing price.

Yet another bitcoin clone derivative, this time BTC2.0, rose to an ATH of $1.06 to register a return of 538x, although the price has retraced markedly from its peak.

Bitcoin clone tokens with stake-to-earn Bitcoin BSC coin

Bitcoin BSC aims to match, or beat, the success of all of these Bitcoin clone coins, and to achieve that end it has a not-so-secret weapon – staking.

While the performance of BTC2.0, not to be confused with BTC20, since its heights has been somewhat underwhelming, there has been more of a steady-as-she-goes approach by the likes of BTC20.

That's probably largely down to the ballast effect of staking, which bears down on any selling pressure that may emerge at listing.

In this way, Bitcoin BSC seeks to emulate BTC20 by adopting a similar design and strategy, providing the price with a stable platform for takeoff.

Like BTC20, Bitcoin BSC has staking utility built into its design from the outset.

However, it should be noted that there is one important difference between Bitcoin BSC and BTC20 – Bitcoin BSC is a BEP-20 BNB Smart Chain-compliant token, and BTC20 is an ERC-20 Ethereum-compliant token – hence the BSC in the name.

Staking has been popular in the crypto DeFi space, but enthusiasm waned in the aftermath of high-profile implosions of staking ecosystems such as Terra Luna.

However, the attractiveness of transparent staking that has a clearly defined source of yield, unlike the opaque algorithms in use on Terra Luna, has not gone away.

With $BTCBSC, which runs on the BNB Smart Chain, the yield is paid out over a 120-year period, in line with Bitcoin block confirmations. Altogether, 69% of the total token supply is allocated to distribute as rewards.

Staking provides token holders with a way of earning token rewards in proportion to how many coins of the total pool they deposit into a staking smart contract and the time they choose to stake for.

It is this staking feature that will deliver price support while offering both positive capital returns and income yield to network participants.

Bitcoin BSC staking is operative now, even before the coin lists on the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap.

You can keep an eye on how many token holders are staking by visiting the real-time Bitcoin BSC staking dashboard .

Also, keep up-to-date with all project developments on X (formerly Twitter)

and the Telegram channel .

You can snap up

Bitcoin BSC at the low Bitcoin 2011 price of $0.99

$BTCBSC can be bought today for $ 0.99 – the same price the Bitcoin was at back in its 2011 early days, and a far cry from the $25,7000 it will cost you to purchase Bitcoin at today's prices.

Bitcoin BSC's comparatively low price means contributors to the presale could be sitting on substantial upside potential when the Bitcoin halving bull run takes off.

The four-yearly event that sees block rewards halved on the original Bitcoin network has previously ushered in mind-melting bull runs.

This halving is expected to have the effect of lifting all boats – especially the prices of quality Bitcoin clone derivative coins such as $BTCBSC.

Bitcoin BSC has the same total token supply as Bitcoin – 21 million. Of that total supply, 29% is up for grabs through the presale of 6,125,000 tokens, meaning BTCBSC has an initial market cap of $6,063,750.

Two percent of the supply is reserved for DEX liquidity provision to guarantee smooth trading at launch and beyond.

The remaining 14,455,000 BTCBSC tokens (69% of supply) is reserved for staking rewards, which are paid out every 10 minutes as new blocks are added to the chain.

At that token emission rate, the maximum supply will be reached in about 120 years – the same time frame as Bitcoin.

Presale and post-presale investors can buy and stake tokens at any time with a 7-day lock on withdrawals.

Bear in mind that because BTCBSC runs on the BNB Smart Chain, to buy and stake in the presale, you will need to use BNB for your purchase. However, those buying with ETH today can start staking after the presale ends.

Faster, cheaper, more powerful and expandable than other Bitcoin clones

Still, staking is not the only advantage BTCBSC has over Bitcoin and the larger-cap clone coins such as Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV.

For one thing, $BTCBSC uses a proof-of-stake protocol, which means it runs on a much more scalable blockchain that is also cheaper and more efficient to transact on.

Because BTCBSC is built on the BNB Smart Chain, transaction fees are less than $0.10, compared to around $10 on Bitcoin and approximately $20 on Ethereum, depending on network conditions.

Another advantage BTCBSC has is its fast transaction speeds, which are typically less than 5 seconds compared to 10 minutes for Bitcoin, BCH, and BSV.

BNB Smart Chain is capable of running applications, too, so there's no limit to future development possibilities for Bitcoin BSC.

Bitcoin BSC has a lot going for it, and with only $3,960,000 being raised in the presale, demand is sure to be robust.

Crypto market prices are generally becalmed, but there are waters where the current is much healthier. In the Bitcoin derivative clone sector, there's all to play for as far as bagging out 10x gains goes.

Get in early, and the rewards will not just accrue to long-term stakers earning a generAPY, but also to those who want the chance to access life-changing returns.

Two years ago, El Salvador shrugged off a chorus of warnings and adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in a bid to revitalize its economy and improve access to financial services.

It has not worked.

Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since then and though President Nayib Bukele is wildly popular for his clampdown on criminal gangs, his currency gamble has not gone down equally well.

Tech enthusiast Bukele wanted to make it easier, and cheaper, for Salvadorans to receive remittances from family members abroad and to provide financial services access to the 70 percent of people with no bank account.

Remittances account for a fifth of the country's GDP.

But two years after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as its currency, alongside the US dollar, ""the goals that were pursued... have not been achieved, people hardly use it, they don't have much trust"" in crypto, economist and former Reserve Bank governor Carlos Acevedo told AFP.

""The experiment has not worked, it is a crypto winter,"" he said.

There are no figures available on how many Salvadorans have taken up Bitcoin.

But a poll conducted in May by the Central American University found that 71 percent believed the cryptocurrency ""has in no way helped to improve their family economic situation.""

On the streets of San Salvador, the verdict is harsh.

""I don't see that money working, it's just propaganda. Where's the benefit? There's no benefit. It's a bad investment,"" newspaper vendor Juan Antonio Salgado, 65, told AFP.

""It's robbery,"" he added, in reference to the currency's volatility.

Two years ago, Bitcoin traded at about $45,000, and a few months later reached a record $68,000.

Today, it is worth just over $25,500.

- Cash is king -

To facilitate Bitcoin transactions, the government created the so-called ""Chivo"" digital wallet and promised each user the equivalent of $30.

But in one measure of Bitcoin's slow adoption, the Reserve Bank said only one percent of the $4.71 billion received in remittances between January and July this year came via Chivo.

""People don't really have confidence in a cryptocurrency whose value changes from one moment to the next, and... people prefer to use hard cash,"" economist Julia Martinez told AFP.

For Acevedo, it is too soon to ""speak of a government failure"" as Bitcoin's ""price could rise at any moment and then it will be a different scenario.""

At the time of Bukele's announcement in 2021, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank warned about the risks of currency fluctuation, and said the plan could leave the country more vulnerable to money laundering and other illicit activities, threatening its underlying stability.

The change meant that every Salvadoran business -- even neighborhood shopkeepers -- had to accept the cryptocurrency as payment.

After Bitcoin hit $68,000 in November 2021, a buoyant Bukele announced plans to build a ""Bitcoin City"" that would be powered by thermal energy from a volcano.

The country would issue $1 billion in Bitcoin bonds to finance the initiative, he announced.

Nothing has come of the project or the bonds to date.

- 'We're going forward' -

The government has said it has purchased 2,381 Bitcoin, without revealing the rate. The last purchase was of 80 units in June 2022.

In November last year, Bukele said the government would buy one Bitcoin every day, though it is not known whether this has come to pass.

Economist Cesar Villalona told AFP that Bitcoin ""does not exist in the local economy"" in any significant way, because in El Salvador ""everything"" is paid in dollars: wages, services and goods.

The crypto initiative does have its fans, though.

YouTuber Jose Francisco Ayala, 38, said it was just a matter of education.

""We're going forward, we're not going backwards,"" he told AFP. ""The more we learn the more we will get into it.""",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/07/AFP_40bd3image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.872836,e91eb845c0172c07589f306abbb5dc2e
330,Why Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoins Are Just Better,MENAFN,2023-09-07 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107028816/Why-Bitcoin-Backed-Stablecoins-Are-Just-Better,menafn.com,"Stablecoins have become one of the most crucial components of the digital currency landscape. These cryptocurrencies, tokens, etc. are generally des","Bitcoin-backed stablecoins hold an edge over other alternatives due to key factors such as security, decentralization, transparency, and scalability.

Bitcoin-backed stablecoins will soon become an integral part of the Bitcoin ecosystem by allowing bitcoin holders to acquire dollars without spending bitcoin, which could minimize tax burden, counterparty risk and reliance on traditional fiat currency rails.

Many projects are building stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each essentially functions with collateral locked into a smart contract and a new stablecoin minted into existence as a dollar-denominated loan against the collateral.

One key advantage of a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin is the transparency and decentralization provided by the Bitcoin blockchain. As Bitcoin is a public ledger, all transactions are recorded and can be verified by anyone, ensuring trust and accountability.

Bitcoin remains one of the most trusted and longest tenured blockchains. Due to its widespread adoption, it can provide better security than all of the other blockchains on the market today. Additionally, the scarcity and liquidity of Bitcoin contribute to the stability of these stablecoins. The widespread adoption and recognition of Bitcoin provides ample liquidity in the market.

The robustness of Bitcoin's decentralized architecture makes it resistant to censorship or control by any central authority, enhancing user confidence as it reduces counterparty risk associated with traditional centralized systems.

Bitcoin's decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the stablecoin. This decentralization mitigates the risk of manipulation or sudden collapse often associated with centralized stablecoins. Furthermore, Bitcoin's robust network provides a high level of security for transactions and holdings.

Extensive computing power makes Bitcoin resistant to hacking attempts, ensuring that stablecoin funds remain secure. Additionally, Bitcoin's transparency enables users to verify transactions independently, thereby reducing the risk of fraud or mismanagement. Bitcoin-backed stablecoins benefit from the underlying cryptocurrency 's established market liquidity and global recognition. This liquidity makes it easier for users to convert their stablecoins into other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies without experiencing significant price slippage or transaction delays.

Bitcoin-backed stablecoins have unique advantages that set them apart from other stablecoin options. The first notable advantage is the inherent stability provided by bitcoin's established and resilient blockchain network. Bitcoin's long-standing reputation and massive market capitalization offer a solid foundation for stability, making it an ideal choice for backing stablecoins. Bitcoin-backed stablecoins also offer increased transparency and decentralization compared to other options.

Users can easily verify the backing reserves and ensure their stability. The decentralized nature of bitcoin also eliminates the need for centralized authorities or intermediaries, reducing counterparty risk. Bitcoin-backed stablecoins benefit from a global reach and acceptance within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin's widespread adoption makes it easier to exchange these stablecoins across variplatforms and markets worldwide.

One of the most promising applications of DeFi is Bitcoin-backed stablecoins, which aim to provide stability to the volatile world of digital currencies. Bitcoin-backed stablecoins leverage the inherent stability and widespread adoption of Bitcoin to create a reliable and secure form of digital currency. Most importantly, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin can helpas individuals reduce our reliance on fiat currency.

Analysts noted that, as a result, changes in electricity prices will now have a lesser impact on the costs associated with Bitcoin mining.

According to data, the current Bitcoin market price is approximately $25,800.

'We had previously determined that a one cent per kWh [kilowatt-hour] change in the cost of electricity results in a $4,300 change in the cost of producing Bitcoins.

After the revised CBECI methodology, we anticipate a modest decline in this sensitivity to approximately $3,800,' the analysts said.

'This sensitivity would mechanically double after the 2024 halving event,' they added.

The imminent Bitcoin halving event will halve the rewards miners receive, and fluctuations in electricity costs will have a more significant impact on their overall expenses, making cost management even more crucial for miners.

JPMorgan reiterated on Wednesday that the halving event could serve as a stress test for bitcoin miners, given the high sensitivity of Bitcoin production costs to electricity prices.

The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance revised the index's methodology last week to improve its accuracy and reliability.

The index monitors and estimates the Bitcoin network's electricity consumption.

The new CBECI methodology acknowledges that not all mining equipment contributing to Bitcoin's hash rate should be regarded equally, as miners frequently upgrade to more contemporary, more efficient equipment or operate varimachines with varying efficiencies.

According to Zschaepitz's X post, the oil price spike occurred after Saudi Arabia announced it would continue to reduce oil production for an additional three months.

A week ago, Bitcoin soared 7.88% within an hour after news broke that Grayscale prevailed in court against the SEC regulator regarding converting its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF.

GNY, which has developed the free AI-powered Range Report, a cutting-edge machine learning tool designed specifically to forecast the volatility of the 12 top cryptocurrencies by leveraging multiple data points and advanced algorithms, carried out its study when Bitcoin was around $30,000 having gained around 76% this year.



It has recently further enhanced the tool to use large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's LLaMa 2. making it even easier for users to identify notable changes in trends and signals in the crypto market.



The innovative platform empowers traders with accurate intelligence on potential price fluctuations, helping them make informed investment decisions as well as providing guidance on how to use and read charts, and market wide information. It simplifies the complex world of crypto into digestible information.



GNY's research found 78% of the non-professional/traders trading at least $5,000 a month on cryptocurrencies it questioned in the UK, US, Germany, Brazil, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UAE and South Africa, believe Bitcoin's price will growth further this year. Around 19% predict it will pass $45,000. Around 4% believe it could double to $60,000.



Confidence in Bitcoin's price is driving increased interest in it from traders. Around two out of three (64%) say they expect to stake 25% or more of their trading on Bitcoin compared to 58% who put the same amount or more into the cryptocurrency last year.



Cosmas Wong, CEO GNY said: 'Bitcoin is clearly the king of the cryptos and that is reflected in the optimism about its price and the increased focus of trading. Next year's BTC halving will likely precipitate another bull run as it has done before. The difference this time is that we have a deeper and more mature alt coin market.



'Although the GNY Range Report tracks BTC and ETH, it is also designed to track 10 popular altcoins.

The GNY Range Report is not a traditional news or chart aggregation platform. It leverages the power of machine learning to identify patterns in top crypto assets' historical trading in order to forecast price volatility, delivering them in an approachable way.'



GNY.io is using Large Language Models, another exploding sector of AI, to help make the insights in the GNY Range Report even more accessible. 'Even looking at the GNY Range Report, which is extremely streamlined, can be too much for people who are interested in crypto but short on bandwidth', says Wong. 'Our AI Readouts will summarize the chart trends and eventually users will be able to interact with the models to customize the information they want, set alerts and customise notifications.'



GNY.io will also launch DataNFTs, or DNFTs, which will lay the foundation for openness and transparency into GNY's processes, and for trustless ML collaboration. Using GNY DNFTs, community members and developers will be able to contribute data, models and other work products to the GNY Range Report and securely track usage, earnings, and subsequent implementation and data collaboration.

Unlike traditional market analysis tools, the GNY Range Report serves as a centralised hub, gathering and consolidating all relevant information in one place. The GNY Range Report ensures traders have access to the most pertinent data without feeling overwhelmed.

Or,"Orvidas is accused of enticing at least four individuals, referred to as'pool participants,' into his scheme, where he made extravagant promises of substantial profits and the security of their investments.

However, the outcomes sharply contradicted his claims, as he squandered most of their funds through reckless trading.

To exacerbate his deception, Orvidas resorted to fabricating information, presenting fictitifinancial documents, and offering justifications to conceal the losses.

Ultimately, these deceptive actions resulted in the pool participants suffering losses exceeding $2 million.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) order mandates Orvidas to make restitution payments exceeding $2 million and imposes a significant civil monetary penalty of $500,000.

Furthermore, it compels Orvidas to cease any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The order also imposes a ten-year ban on Orvidas's registration and participation in trading activities .

Orvidas' fraudulent activities occurred between October 2017 and July 2020, during which he deceived investors by misrepresenting his trading capabilities, falsifying profits, and making unfounded assurances regarding the safety of their investments.

Additionally, it's worth noting that Michael and Amanda Griffis, proprietors of a real estate business in Clarksville, Tennessee, were the subject of a complaint from the CFTC on July 25, alleging their involvement in defrauding more than 100 individuals in a scheme related to a digital assets commodity pool, as reported.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/08/C_35b69image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,7.171827,3e9c578b9791a1f1ae9c52010a427804

predictions around
 Bitcoin (BTC), asserting that the cryptocurrency is poised for a significant bullish rally in the coming months. 


Despite recent market uncertainties, Doctor Profit remains confident in BTC's long-term potential, emphasizing the importance of zooming out and considering broader market trends. 


Bitcoin Surge To $90,000?


Bitcoin is currently trading at $25,800, displaying a stagnant pattern within a narrow range of $25,700 to $26,200. The cryptocurrency's recent attempt to consolidate above $27,000 and surpass its strongest resistance at $28,000 proved unsuccessful.

BTCUSDT on TradingView.com


Furthermore, the BTC market has exhibited signs of fear and outflows in recent weeks, characterized by low volatility and trading volume. As a result, Bitcoin has lost its previous bullish momentum, awaiting a catalyst that could reignite its upward trajectory.


On this matter, while acknowledging the possibility of further market manipulations, pump-and-dump schemes, and the dissemination of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), Doctor Profit advises investors to maintain resilience and navigate through these challenging conditions.


According to Doctor Profit, two crucial factors will drive Bitcoin's surge to new heights. Firstly, the upcoming halving event, a phenomenon occurring every four years that historically triggers a bull cycle in BTC with remarkable accuracy. 


Secondly, the anticipated approval of a BlackRock exchange-traded fund (ETF), which could attract institutional investors and fuel the BTC frenzy.


Doctor Profit points out an interesting correlation between the BlackRock ETF approval and the BTC halving. The deadline for the BlackRock ETF falls in March, just one month before the anticipated halving. 


This synchronicity, in Doctor Profit's view, sets the stage for the 'ETF, Institution, BTC FOMO' bull market, potentially igniting a period of significant upward momentum.


Based on his analysis and historical trends, Doctor Profit forecasts a sudden BTC pump above $30,000, with initial targets ranging from $40,000 to $45,000 in 2023. He further predicts a consolidation period followed by a surge in July or June 2024, projecting conservative targets of $90,000 and optimistic targets exceeding $150,000.


BTC's Price Set For Sideways Consolidation 


In the short term, Doctor Profit 
anticipates 
a sideways consolidation in Bitcoin's price until the following week. With lower trading volume and fewer data releases, the market is expected to remain calm. 
 
He identifies two liquidity pools around the $28,500 region, aligned with the daily MA50 and MA100, as critical levels to monitor. Additionally, he points out a liquidity pool at around $25,200 that could be utilized for quick profit-taking through short-term long scalps.

Doctor Profit on X.


Drawing upon historical data, Doctor Profit highlights September's reputation as a challenging month for both stocks and Bitcoin. He warns against disregarding this historical trend, cautioning investors against assuming that the current market conditions are different. 


The chart patterns, liquidity dynamics, psychological factors, and Bitcoin's cycle all point towards a downward trajectory, suggesting the need for caution and preparedness.

Fort Lauderdale, FL , Sept. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.
 (NASDAQ:
MARA
) (""Marathon"" or ""Company"")
, a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin ('BTC') production and miner installation updates for August 2023.
 
Management Commentary
 
'We produced 1,072 bitcoin in August, which is a 9% decrease from last month and a more than fivefold increase from August of last year,' said Fred Thiel, Marathon's chairman and CEO. 'The decrease in bitcoin production from July was largely due to increased curtailment activity in Texas due to record high temperatures. These temporary shutdowns more than offset the progress we have made to increase our operational hash rate and optimize our operations.
 
'In August, we increased our U.S. operational hash rate 2% month-over-month to 19.1 exahashes, and we increased our installed hash rate 1% month-over-month to 23.1 exahashes. The sequential increase is primarily due to swapping BITMAIN S19 J Pro miners for more efficient S19 XPs. We are still waiting for the facility in Garden City, Texas to come online as Applied Digital and the utility provider are still finalizing paperwork. Based on the latest updates, we continue to believe energization is imminent.
 
'We also saw continued progress at our joint venture in Abu Dhabi which began hashing in July and mined 50 bitcoin in August of which approximately 10 bitcoin is our share. The JV's operational hash rate grew to 1.5 exahashes, and we continue to expect the project's full 7.0 exahashes to be online before year-end 2023.
 
'During August, we reached our primary domestic growth target of 23 exahashes on an installed basis. As we look to our next growth target, I am pleased to announce that we have secured miners in the ordinary course of business for the next 5 exahashes of hash rate growth. With 23 exahashes installed domestically, two exahashes planned internationally, and an additional five exahashes of capacity contracted for, Marathon's total anticipated hash rate, once fully deployed, is now 30 exahashes.'

While verifying that the event did not affect traders' funds, the platform acknowledged that a system bug led to the distribution of 20 BTC in mining rewards on a single transaction.

While Chun initially consented to refunding the reward, he later changed his mind and reached out to the cryptocurrency community for guidance.

The reason Chun is reticent to return the funds to Paxos is because he is'irritated' that'the person claiming it kept saying EST instead of EDT or UTC.'

Adding to Chun's dilemma, the crypto community on X (previously Twitter) held contradictory viewpoints, each supported by sound reasoning.

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, understanding the nuances and distinctions between Litecoin and Bitcoin becomes crucial for investors, enthusiasts, and anyone seeking to engage with these digital currencies.

This comparative study aims to delve into the essential aspects of Litecoin and Bitcoin, shedding light on their histories, technologies, adoption, and prospects, ultimately providing insights into how these cryptocurrencies differ and complement each other in the ever-expanding world of decentralized digital assets.



Inception: Bitcoin was conceptualized in a whitepaper published in 2008 by an entity or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It was introduced as a response to the global financial crisis, aiming to create a decentralized digital currency.

Genesis Block: The first Bitcoin block, known as the'genesis block,' was mined in January 2009, marking the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Early Development: Bitcoin's early years were characterized by a small community of developers and enthusiasts who laid the foundation for its technology and principles.

Popularity and Growth: Bitcoin gained popularity over the years, attracting miners, investors, and a burgeoning ecosystem of exchanges and wallet providers.

Price Milestones: Bitcoin's price experienced significant fluctuations, with notable milestones including the 2013 surge, the 2017 bull run, and subsequent price stability. Scaling Debate: Bitcoin faced challenges related to scalability, leading to debates about block size and the development of solutions like Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network.



Creation: Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, and released in October 2011 as an open-source project.

Fork of Bitcoin: Litecoin is often referred to as the'silver' to Bitcoin's'gold' because it is based on the Bitcoin source code with some modifications.

Distinguishing Features: Litecoin was designed to offer faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. It also introduced the Scrypt mining algorithm as an alternative to Bitcoin's SHA-256.

Early Adoption: Litecoin gained traction quickly, attracting a user base interested in faster and cheaper transactions.

Price Evolution: Litecoin's price has also seen its share of volatility, with significant price increases during cryptocurrency bull markets. Development and Upgrades: Litecoin has undergone variupdates and protocol improvements, including the adoption of SegWit and the possibility of implementing features like MimbleWimble for enhanced privacy.

Both Bitcoin and Litecoin have their unique histories and paths of development, which have shaped their respective roles in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Understanding their origins is crucial to comprehending their current significance and potential future trajectories.

Here are some notable differences between Bitcoin and Litecoin:



Block Time and Transaction Confirmation

Coin Supply and Scarcity

Mining Algorithms Development Teams and Governance



Bitcoin: Bitcoin has a block time of approximately 10 minutes. This means that new blocks are added to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes, leading to longer confirmation times for transactions. Litecoin: Litecoin boasts a shorter block time, with blocks added to its blockchain approximately every 2.5 minutes. This results in faster transaction confirmation times, making Litecoin more suitable for everyday transactions.



Bitcoin: Bitcoin has a maximum supply cap of 21 million coins, making it deflationary by design. This scarcity is often compared to digital gold, and the diminishing block rewards create a sense of scarcity over time. Litecoin: Litecoin, on the other hand, has a maximum supply cap of 84 million coins, four times that of Bitcoin. This larger supply can potentially influence its value and utility in the market differently.



Bitcoin: Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) mining algorithm, which is resource-intensive and dominated by ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners. Litecoin: Litecoin introduced the Scrypt mining algorithm as an alternative to SHA-256. Scrypt was designed to be more memory-intensive, initially leveling the playing field for miners using consumer-grade hardware. This aimed to promote a more decentralized mining ecosystem.



Bitcoin: Bitcoin development is decentralized, with contributions from a diverse group of developers and multiple implementations (e.g., Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots). Changes and upgrades are typically implemented through a consensus-building process involving varistakeholders. Litecoin: Litecoin development is often guided by its creator, Charlie Lee, and a smaller team of developers. While it maintains open-source principles, the development process may differ from Bitcoin's in terms of centralization.

These key differences in block time, coin supply, mining algorithms, and governance structures contribute to distinct use cases and characteristics for Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Bitcoin is often considered a store of value and a digital gold, while Litecoin's faster transaction times make it suitable for smaller, everyday transactions. Each cryptocurrency's unique features cater to different user needs within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.



Digital Gold: Bitcoin is primarily seen as a store of value and a digital equivalent of gold. Many investors view it as a long-term asset to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.

Investment: Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption as an investment asset. Institutional investors, hedge funds, and retail investors hold and trade Bitcoin as a speculative investment.

Global Transactions: Bitcoin can be used for international remittances and cross-border transactions. Its decentralized nature and borderless accessibility make it suitable for transferring value across borders.

Asset Diversification: Some individuals incorporate Bitcoin into their investment portfolios as a way to diversify their holdings and reduce risk. Payment Method (Limited): While not its primary use case, some businesses accept Bitcoin as a payment method, allowing customers to make purchases using cryptocurrency.



Fast and Low-Cost Transactions: Litecoin's primary use case is for day-to-day transactions. Its shorter block time and lower fees make it more suitable for buying goods and services compared to Bitcoin.

Microtransactions: Litecoin is often used for microtransactions, including tipping content creators and making small online purchases.

Testing Ground: Litecoin sometimes serves as a testing ground for new technologies and features before they are implemented in Bitcoin. For instance, Litecoin adopted Segregated Witness (SegWit) before Bitcoin did.

Alternative Investment: Some investors view Litecoin as an alternative or complementary investment to Bitcoin, with potential for price appreciation and utility in smaller transactions.

Merchant Adoption: Litecoin has seen adoption among a range of merchants, both online and offline, who accept it as a payment method. Liquidity Pair: Litecoin is a common trading pair with other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, offering liquidity and trading opportunities.

Bitcoin's primary fois on being a store of value and a digital gold, whereas Litecoin's primary utility is in facilitating fast and cost-effective transactions.

While Bitcoin has achieved broader recognition and institutional adoption, Litecoin remains relevant for users seeking efficient and practical means of conducting everyday transactions in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Here is prices and market performance of bitcoin and litecoin:



Price Evolution: Bitcoin's price has experienced significant volatility since its inception. It started with virtually no value and reached historic milestones, including surpassing $1,000, $10,000, and even $60,000 per BTC during bull markets.

Market Capitalization: Bitcoin consistently maintains its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often accounting for a dominant share of the total cryptocurrency market cap.

Liquidity: Bitcoin is highly liquid and widely traded on numercryptocurrency exchanges around the world. It benefits from a deep and active market.

Price Influencing Factors: Bitcoin's price is influenced by varifactors, including macroeconomic events, investor sentiment, institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and supply-related events such as halvings. Market Cycles: Bitcoin has gone through several market cycles, characterized by periods of rapid price increases (bull markets) followed by corrections (bear markets). Understanding these cycles is crucial for investors.



Price Evolution: Litecoin's price history shares similarities with Bitcoin, including significant price increases during cryptocurrency bull markets. It reached an all-time high during the 2017-2018 bull run.

Market Capitalization: While Litecoin is among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, it is typically ranked below Bitcoin and some other prominent altcoins.

Liquidity: Litecoin is relatively liquid, with active trading on variexchanges. However, its trading volume is generally lower than that of Bitcoin.

Price Influencing Factors: Litecoin's price is influenced by similar factors to Bitcoin, including market sentiment, adoption, and developments in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Market Cycles: Like Bitcoin, Litecoin has experienced market cycles, characterized by periods of price growth followed by corrections. These cycles are often influenced by trends in the broader cryptocurrency market.

It's important to note that both Bitcoin and Litecoin are subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, and their prices can be influenced by a wide range of factors.

Investors should conduct thorough research and risk assessment before participating in these markets, and they should be prepared for price fluctuations.

Additionally, the performance of both cryptocurrencies can differ significantly over time, with Bitcoin generally being more stable and influential in the market.

Here is security and network stability of bitcoin and litecoin:



Hashrate and Network Security: Bitcoin has one of the highest hashrates among all cryptocurrencies, thanks to its popularity and the vast number of miners securing the network. This high hashrate contributes to the network's robust security against attacks like 51% attacks.

Longevity and Proven Security: Bitcoin has been operational since 2009, and over time, it has demonstrated a high level of network security and resistance to hacking or maliciattacks.

ConsenMechanism: Bitcoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consenmechanism, which has proven to be secure over the years. PoW requires miners to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to add blocks to the blockchain. Security Incidents: While Bitcoin itself has not suffered major security breaches, some incidents involving exchanges and third-party services have resulted in the loss of Bitcoin holdings for users.



Hashrate and Network Security: Litecoin's hashrate is significantly lower than Bitcoin's due to its smaller user base and mining community. While it has lower security compared to Bitcoin, it is still considered reasonably secure against attacks.

Proven Security: Litecoin has also been operational for an extended period and has not experienced major security breaches or vulnerabilities.

Node Network: Litecoin benefits from a distributed node network, though it is not as extensive as Bitcoin's. This decentralization contributes to the overall stability and security of the network.

ConsenMechanism: Litecoin shares Bitcoin's PoW consenmechanism, ensuring secure transaction validation and block creation. Security Incidents: Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin itself has not suffered significant security breaches, but incidents involving third-party services can impact user security.

In terms of security and network stability, both Bitcoin and Litecoin benefit from the robustness of the Proof-of-Work consenmechanism and their respective blockchain networks.

However, Bitcoin's larger hashrate and longer history provide it with a more substantial security edge, making it the more secure and stable network between the two.

Nonetheless, Litecoin remains a secure and stable cryptocurrency network in its own right, especially for everyday transactions and use cases. Users should exercise caution with third-party services and exchanges, as vulnerabilities there can affect both cryptocurrencies.

Here is security and network stability of bitcoin and litecoin:



Layer 2 Solutions: Bitcoin continues to explore and implement Layer 2 scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network. These off-chain solutions aim to enhance transaction speed and reduce fees while maintaining the security of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain.

350,Microstrategy's Stock Soars With Bitcoin's Resurgence,MENAFN,2023-09-12 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107054558/Microstrategys-Stock-Soars-With-Bitcoins-Resurgence,menafn.com,"MicroStrategy's stock price increased by 3% on Tuesday after Bitcoin's price rebounded above the $26,000 mark following several days of underperform","Microstrategy is the largest publicly traded company holding the flagship cryptocurrency, with 158,800 BTC valued at over $4 billion listed as part of its assets.

MicroStrategy's shares climbed 3% in premarket trading on Tuesday, following Bitcoin's 4% revival, which broke the $26,000 threshold for the first time since last Friday.

At the time of writing, MicroStrategy's stock was trading for approximately $353 per share before the market's opening, while BTC's price was $26,144.

Several altcoins were boosted by Bitcoin's rise, with Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano gaining between 1.5% and 2.5%.

Given that Michael Saylor's company is the largest corporate holder of cryptocurrency, the correlation between MicroStrategy's stock price and Bitcoin is not surprising.

The corporation is viewed as a Bitcoin proxy, functioning almost like an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

As of August 1, 2023, MicroStrategy had 158,800 bitcoins. Its total purchase price for the most significant crypto asset is more than $4.5 billion, with an average price of about $29,672 per coin.

MicroStrategy has become synonymwith Bitcoin over the years, which appears to be the company's intention, and it presently controls nearly 0.7% of the total Bitcoin supply.

The future supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins.The business and stock performance of MicroStrategy have unquestionably benefited from the company's aggressive Bitcoin strategy.

This week, the company and other large corporate Bitcoin holders received a stimulus.

Notably, crypto companies and businesses with substantial Bitcoin holdings have embraced the long-awaited accounting rules to determine the value of their crypto holdings , which were approved by a unanimvote ofaccounting policymakers.

Under the new regulations, companies that hold or invest in cryptocurrencies must report their holdings at fair value, enabling them to account for the most current value of an asset, including price recoveries.

Although the new rules will likely add volatility to the earnings of companies heavily exposed to cryptocurrencies, the ability to record price recoveries is anticipated to improve current accounting practices significantly, according to company statements .",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/12/C_5e38dimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.878505,13ff5a263300cd50e806e7779172229a
351,"Can New Bitcoin Bsc Coin Repeat The Bitcoin Price Move From $1 To $30,000 And Mint More Millionaires?",MENAFN,2023-09-15 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107077809/Can-New-Bitcoin-Bsc-Coin-Repeat-The-Bitcoin-Price-Move-From-1-To-30000-And-Mint-More-Millionaires,menafn.com,"NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --If you had bought $100 of Bitcoin in 2011, it would have been worth $3m when BTC was trading at $30,00","Crypto investors certainly think so, which explains why the 'Bitcoin on BNB Smart Chain' staking crypto asset has raised more than $2 million

in less than two weeks as its presale races toward the finish line of $3.96 million.

Currently priced at just $0.99 in presale – roughly the price Bitcoin was at in 2011 – Bitcoin BSC has a much better risk-reward profile for potential investors than Bitcoin, not to mention the staking yield that generates an income stream to buttress capital returns.

To be sure not to miss out on the presale alpha opportunities and the listing, which could be next week, follow the project's X (formerly Twitter)

account and join the Telegram group .

Behind the headlines about 'crypto winter' which followed failing crypto banks and exchanges, Bitcoin is actually looking in pretty good shape, and so are the Bitcoin derivative and clone coins that seek to provide a value differential over the original offering.

Bitcoin BSC, like Bitcoin, has a total supply of 21 million tokens. However, unlike Bitcoin, it runs on a proof-of-stake network, the BNB Smart Chain, which is a cheaper and more efficient blockchain.

The latest Bitcoin alternative coin has something else going for it that Bitcoin doesn't – staking built in by design.

If you buy Bitcoin BSC today with BNB, you can start staking and earning yield. Token buyers have jumped at the chance to start locking in passive income. So over 1,000,000 $BTCBSC has been staked and is currently earning an annual percentage yield (APY) of 268%.

The current staked tokens amounts to almost half of the total number of sold $BTCBSC to date.

Often when you see an APY in triple figures, it can ring alarm bells given the huge spread it represents over the current interest rate levels in the advanced economies, which are in single figures.

Everything is transparent with Bitcoin BSC, which means you can keep tabs on how many token holders are staking by visiting the real-time Bitcoin BSC staking dashboard .

In addition, the project's smart contracts are audited , and a guarantee of locked liquidity has been provided by the team for when it is listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX).

With $BTCBSC, there is no impenetrable and opaque algorithm-based financial engineering built on rickety foundations like Terra Luna. Instead, Bitcoin BSC has allocated 69% of token supply to be paid out in rewards to stakers.

The pre-mined $BTCBSC tokens are emitted at a rate of 0.25 $BTCBSC per block in a block production schedule that mimics Bitcoin by rolling time back to 2011.

$BTCBSC rewards are paid out every 10 minutes in a similar fashion to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin BSC is part of a new wave of derivative clone coins into the bitcoin space, drawing on the version 2.0 theme but, in this case, also leveraging the utility of staking.

These staking-based bitcoin clone coins come to market with the added security of buyers knowing that they come with a sizeable portion of the token-holding community already committed to the project through their deposits into its staking smart contract.

This means when the token launches on decentralized exchanges, there will be far less selling pressure due to the yield-bearing presence of staking at the heart of its tokenomics.

Staked coins have a seven-day withdrawal lock, after which tokens can be taken off stake at any time. Those who initiate stakes after $BTCBSC is listed will be able to stake their tokens regardless of whether they have bought with BNB or ETH. But if you wish to initiate staking while the presale is still in progress, then you must purchase with BNB.

Staking makes offerings like Bitcoin BSC far superior to the utility-light meme coin version 2 clones such as Pepe 2.0, Dogecoin 2.0, Shiba Inu 2.0, or even the likes of Bitcoin 2.0, whose only resemblance to bitcoin was in the name of the token.

Then there are coins such as HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (HPOS10I) that uses the ticker BITCOIN on DEXs – although most centralized exchanges refuse to allow it to use it. It does not have a 21 million supply and is really a meme coin take on Bitcoin with zero utility.

Nevertheless, as a meme coin that has achieved a level of virality, HPOS10I has attracted substantial interest, providing an example of the power of 'bitcoin' brand name recognition. From launch to peak, HPOS10I has returned 66,000% for early investors, provided they sold at the top.

But Bitcoin BSC is looking to play at the more seriend of the spectrum, where coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to Bitcoin.

However, these assets are forks from the original blockchain and carry all the baggage and complications that come with that, such as maintaining and developing the protocol.

Still, Bitcoin Cash was the earliest such fork if we exclude Litecoin, and although it is some way off its highs, it has nevertheless been able to outperform Bitcoin in recent weeks.

Then there's BTC20 coin

which launched a little over a month ago and also compares favorably to Bitcoin. While bitcoin has slid, at one stage slipping under $25,000 earlier this week, BTC20 has not only stayed in the green, it has been earning yield for its stakers.

While Bitcoin is down 7.3% in the past 30 days, BTC20 is up 14% on its list price of $1. Bitcoin Cash is up 4.5% in the past month, also outperforming Bitcoin.

We should also add that in the case of BTC20, shortly after listing, it reached an all-time high of $5.9 for a 6x return for presale investors.

Although some of the comparative returns cited above may not feel particularly spectacular by crypto volatility standards, savvy investors who have been around the block will be aware of the improving fundamentals for Bitcoin and how clone coins with better risk-reward potential, like Bitcoin BSC, are likely to benefit in an outsized way.

Joe Parys Crypto YouTube channel , with 300k-psubscribers, is tipping $BTCBSC as one of five Bitcoin alternatives to see a price explosion.

Another crypto YouTube analyst has invested $840 into BTCBSC , attracted by the APY as well as the token price appreciation potential.

Bitcoin block rewards are due for their four-yearly halving in April 2024, and if past performance is a guide, the coin is on the cusp of yet another bull run. Each previhalving cycle bull run has seen bitcoin hit higher highs.

Aligning with that view, Pantera Capital

predicts that the next cycle will be no different. The crypto asset manager reckons bitcoin will retrace back to $36,000 by the end of this year and surge to around $147k in the next halving cycle.

True to form, bitcoin derivative coins will be among the leading beneficiaries of the halving cycle bull run, likely to outpace many other altcoins.

Institutions and savvy investors have started accumulating Bitcoin in readiness for the next bull run.

Aside from the halving, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the flood of new money – retail and institutional – that will flow into the Bitcoin and broader crypto market as a result, means the next altcoin season threatens to be the mother of all melt ups.

Do your own research, but it probably makes sense to get ready for the upturn by adding some low-cap sparkle to your portfolio.

A relatively modest allocation now to Bitcoin BSC could turn into 5x or even 100x gains

very quickly, and in the near future, as we go into the halving cycle, life-changing profits could be on the table.

If you think digital currencies like Bitcoin are the future but missed out the first time around, then Bitcoin BSC provides a rare opportunity to grab a slice of the action before the bulls start rampaging.

You can buy $BTCBSC today with BNB, ETH or USDT. The minimum purchase amount is $10. Buy with BNB if you want to start staking straightaway before the presale ends. Those who choose to buy with ETH can start staking as soon as the presale ends.

Nigel Green says:'The buzz surrounding AI is real – Nvidia 's (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares, for example, have jumped almost 210% this year on the frenzy around its uses within AI.

'The AI boom is grounded in tangible technological advancements and the potential to reshape industries across the board.



'The transformative capabilities of AI, coupled with its cross-industry disruption, data-driven nature, and rapid innovation, make it a compelling investment opportunity.



'This is, of course, attracting huge amounts of institutional capital.

'These same institutional investors are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as the currency for the AI era and, therefore, are also increasing their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency.'

There are three key reasons why Bitcoin is the currency for AI and why this synergy is attracting institutional money.

'First, in the world of AI, data integrity is paramount. The ability to trust the source and history of data is crucial, whether it's for training machine learning models or verifying the authenticity of data inputs.



Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out .

'Bitcoin's blockchain provides a tamper-proof record that can be used to ensure data integrity in AI applications,' notes Nigel Green.

'Second, Bitcoin's borderless nature facilitates seamless cross-border transactions, enabling AI companies to access the resources they need without the limitations of traditional financial systems, such as high fees and lengthy processing times.

'Third, AI relies heavily on data, and organisations are increasingly seeking ways to monetise their data assets.



'Bitcoin opens-up new possibilities for data marketplace platforms where AI-focused firms can access and purchase datasets with ease, creating a thriving ecosystem of data sharing and monetisation.'

As AI continues to advance, new use cases for Bitcoin in AI applications will inevitably emerge. Research and innovation at the intersection of AI and crypto are likely to unlock even more opportunities for synergy between the two fields.

Institutional investors are forward-thinking and recognise the potential for substantial returns on their investments in this rapidly evolving space.

'As both Bitcoin and AI technologies continue to evolve, their integration is set to drive innovation and transformation in variindustries, reshaping the way we perceive and interact with both digital currencies and artificial intelligence.



'The growing interest from institutional investors underscores the enormpotential of this partnership and further validates Bitcoin's role in the future of AI,' concludes Nigel Green.

BlackRock filed Form S-1 to register its product, while Nasdaq submitted Form 19-b4 to propose rule changes required to list the product.

On June 30, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deemed the most recent filing insufficient, resulting in its early rejection.

This decision relates more to regulatory procedural issues than the product's substance or prospective viability.

However, early rejections may not necessarily be a negative sign for applicants. Nasdaq's Head of U.S. Equities & ETPs, Giang Bui, told Forbes:

After the initial rejection, Nasdaq and others resubmitted variETF applications and listed Coinbase as a partner in the surveillance-sharing agreement.

Bui acknowledged this by stating that it is uncommon to list partners in this manner. However, she explained that the late addition was part of Nasdaq's effort to strengthen its filings.

The proposed spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock is not the only implementation of its kind. Currently, Nasdaq is evaluating a similar proposal from Vaklyrie Investments.

Cboe, meanwhile, handles proposals from other asset management firms, including Ark Invest, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, and Fidelity.

Bitwise has submitted an ETF proposal to NYSE Arca. Many of these proposals characterize a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase and are highly similar.

Grayscale plans to convert its existing GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF in a somewhat distinct manner.

The houses of other accused persons Suneesh Hegde and Prasidh in upscale Sadashivanagar locality in Bengaluru are also raided.

The officers had obtained a search warrant from the jurisdictional court on Monday and the raids have been underway since early morning. The state police department is also contemplating getting the assistance of the Israel authorities in the complicated case, according to sources.

The Congress government in Karnataka had recently issued an order directing reinvestigation into the sensational Bitcoin scam allegedly involving top BJP leaders in the state.

The SIT under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is being formed to take up the probe. Home Minister G. Parameshwara stated that, ""we had discussed about lakhs of crores being siphoned off during the previBJP government. Now, we have ordered a reinvestigation. SIT is being formed under the CID. The scandal involves technical, interstate and international matters,"" he had said.

Sources explain that the bitcoin scandal had taken place after the arrest of alleged international hacker Srikrishna by the CCB Police in Bengaluru. It was alleged that using the accused hacker, the ruling BJP leaders had minted huge money by allowing him to commit the scandal in custody in 2020.

The police had arrested the accused while allegedly selling drugs. The probe revealed that the accused had siphoned off Rs 11 crores by hacking into online gaming companies and government web portals. The accused had allegedly converted the money into bitcoins and carried out drug peddling in Bengaluru.

Congress' Karnataka in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala earlier, in his series of tweets had attacked the BJP central leadership as well as former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai over the bitcoin scandal.

'What is the role and responsibility of the Basavaraj Bommai? (who was the home minister in charge at the relevant time) and others in the state government? Surjewala had questioned, causing severe embarrassment to BJP.

""The layers of the Bitcoin scam are finally being unearthed. Let India's Home minister and Bommai answer. FBI in India to investigate India's biggest Bitcoins scam cover up under the then Karnataka BJP government. If so, release details of the investigation and suspects including political people,' he had stated.

How many Bitcoins were stolen? and of what value? Who in Karnataka is involved? Were the stolen Bitcoins transferred from the wallet of the arranged hacker Srikrishna? Surjewala questioned.

Whether the 'Whale Alerts' reflecting the transfer of the 14,682 stolen Bitfinex Bitcoins valued at Rs 5,240 crores on the two dates December 1, 2020 and April 14, 2021 when Shrikrishna was in custody --- has any correlation? Surjewala said.

He further asked, why was Interpol not informed? Why did the BJP government wait for over 5 months up till April 24, 2021 to write to Interpole and that also after the release of Srikrishna on April 17, 2021.

He also questioned why the National Investigation Agency (NIA), SeriFraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) were not informed by the Karnataka BJP government?

Minister for RDPR, IT and BT Priyanka Kharge, then stated, ""I believe the FBI is in Delhi to investigate the billion dollar Bitcoins scam. Like I said before, if the state investigates the matter, a lot of BJP's skeletons will tumble out of the layers of Bitcoins scam.

Bommai had later challenged AICC General Secretary Randeep Surjewala to submit any information regarding the scandal. ""From my side, I have given a reply to the issue in the Legislative Assembly itself, if he (Randeep Surjewala) has any information on the issue let him submit. Instead tweeting is meaningless,"" he quipped.

Sources explain that the issue is likely to trigger controversy at the national level.

Until recently, prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, had no intention of adopting the layer 2 solution, as many community members argued that NL integration provided fewer incentives for exchanges' income.

Contrary to the prevalent narrative, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong affirmed the exchange's intention to implement the Lightning Network.

The decision was made one month after Viktor Bunin, Protocol Specialist at Coinbase, began investigating the viability of LN integration, he added. During this period, the founder of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, and the CEO of Square, Jack Dorsey, publicly questioned Armstrong's stance on LN.

Following Armstrong's announcement, the cryptocurrency community applauded the decision, as Coinbase's LN integration will enable more users to participate in inexpensive and efficient Bitcoin microtransactions.

'Trading volumes on COIN have historically mirrored fluctuations in bitcoin's price,' analysts led by Dan Dolev wrote.

'Both attained their peaks in 4Q21, when COIN volumes reached nearly $550 billion and the average price of bitcoin exceeded $55,000,' for example.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the report predicts'a stark divergence between COIN volumes and the price of Bitcoin.'

The exchange's volume decreased from $145 billion to $92 billion by the end of the second quarter and is projected to reach around $80 billion by the end of the third quarter.

'This could prove problematic for COIN, as approximately 95% of its transaction revenue comes from retail exchanges,' the note stated, adding that the stock's year-to-date rise is unsustainable.

358,Bitcoin Sentiment Now Close To Extreme Fear: Why This Matters,Hououin Kyouma,2023-09-13 00:00:48,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-close-extreme-fear-why-matters/,newsbtc.com,Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has worsened recently and is now approaching the extreme fear territory.,"Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has worsened recently and is approaching extreme fear territory.


Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Plunged Inside The Fear Region Recently


The '
fear and greed index
' is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency market. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to a hundred to represent this sentiment.


When the index has a value greater than 54, the investors share greed. On the other hand, values under 46 imply the presence of fear in the market. The in-between region naturally suggests that the majority mentality is neutral currently.


Here is what the Bitcoin fear and greed index looks like right now:




The value of the index appears to be 30 at the moment | Source:

As displayed above, the Bitcoin fear and greed index currently has a value of 30, meaning that most investors in the sector share a mentality of fear.
 
Just yesterday, the indicator had a value of 40, implying that the sentiment has worsened quite a bit during the past day.




Looks like the metric's value has sharply declined | Source:

Besides the three core sentiments already discussed, there are also 'extreme fear' and 'extreme greed.' These two regions of the indicator have been pretty significant historically for the cryptocurrency.


The reason is that extreme fear occurs at and under 25 when the major bottoms have formed for the asset's price. Similarly, the tops have occurred in extreme greed (at and above 75).


Bitcoin has generally tended to go against what most investors expect. The extreme regions are when this expectation is the strongest, hence why a reversal occurred.


A trading technique called '
contrarian investing
' exploits this apparent pattern. Warren Buffet's famous quote says, 'be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.'


The current value of the index (30) is quite close to the extreme fear region, which means that if sentiment worsens further in the coming days, it might drop into this territory. Naturally, if such a drop happens, a contrarian investor might take it as a signal to buy the cryptocurrency.
 
Interestingly, if Bitcoin bottoms out in the coming weeks and sets itself up for a reversal, it would align with the historical 
Halloween Effect
. According to this effect, BTC and other assets usually perform the best between 31 October and 1 May.


Those who practice the 'sell in May and go away' strategy come back this season to buy back into the asset. It remains to be seen how the Bitcoin sentiment will develop in the coming month and if the Halloween Effect will play any role.


BTC Price


At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $26,200, up 1% during the past week.

Understanding Key Bitcoin Mining Terms
 
Before delving into investment considerations, it's crucial to understand essential Bitcoin mining terms:
 
● 
Hashrate:
 Hashrate represents the computational power of a miner, measuring how many times a miner can perform hash computations in a specific time unit. Hashrate is typically denominated in kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), tera (T), peta (P), or exa (E) hashes per second.
 
● 
Mining Efficiency:
 Mining efficiency gauges how much energy a miner consumes while performing computations, usually measured in watts (W) or joules (J).
 
Before we jump to the next term, there is an excellent mining data source from HAG that provides the weekly recap about the Bitcoin mining market as the chart below. The columns are essential points in the mining industry.

https://twitter.com/HashrateAsset/status/1696761398980993231?s=20
 
● 
Mining Difficulty:
 Mining difficulty quantifies the complexity of solving cryptographic puzzles to generate new blocks in the blockchain. The initial mining difficulty is 1 which requires 2^32 times of hash computation to generate a new block. With mining difficulty rising, the theoretical times of hash computation to generate a new block should be D*2^32. It is expressed in units of hash and adjusts approximately every 2016 blocks. Higher difficulty values indicate greater complexity.
 
● 
Weekly Average Hashrate:
 This metric provides an overview of the total hash power within the entire Bitcoin network, reflecting the competitive nature of Bitcoin mining.
 
● 
Weekly Average Mining Reward:
 This figure represents the amount of Bitcoin generated based on the total hashrate and mining difficulty.
 
Calculating Profitability
 
Investors often consider two main factors when evaluating Bitcoin mining profitability: revenue/yield and cost.
 
Revenue/Yield:
 Yield can be measured in either dollars or Bitcoin. For most miners, Bitcoin-based yield is the primary focus. The formula to calculate yield is:
 
P = H * (1 / (D * 2^32)) * R * (24 * 60 * 60)
 
Where:
 
● 
H:
 Your hashrate/hashpower.
 
● 
D:
 The current mining difficulty (measured in hash units).
 
● 
R:
 The Bitcoin reward for adding a new block (currently 6.25 Bitcoin per block).
 
This calculation provides your yield on a Bitcoin basis, which can be converted to a dollar basis based on Bitcoin's price.
 
Cost:
 The primary cost associated with Bitcoin mining is electricity cost. Depending on your situation, you may face management electricity costs, pure electricity costs, or electricity costs combined with management fees. Calculating the daily electricity cost involves multiplying the machine's power consumption (in watts) by the electricity cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
 
Closing Price/Break-Even Price:
 The closing price represents the threshold at which mining becomes unprofitable. It is calculated as follows:
 
Price = Cost per machine / Yield per machine
 
These calculations provide a quantitative basis for investment decisions and can be adapted to different scenarios and assumptions. Remember that the closing price varies based on mining equipment, electricity cost, and other assumptions affecting yield.
 
This information serves as a valuable resource for those considering Bitcoin mining investment. HAG, the world's first security token focusing on Bitcoin mining, offers investors the opportunity to earn monthly WBTC distributions. With a commitment to compliance, transparency, and sustainability, HAG invites potential investors to explore their offerings on the 
INX platform
 and join their community to discuss your insights into Bitcoin mining or to learn more about Bitcoin mining within the industry.
 
Caluculating break-even price
 
One important threshold for a miner to decide whether to stop mining is the closing price, aka break-even price. This price will vary across different series of mining equipment, electricity cost, and different assumptions that affect yield. Basically, the closing price could be deducted from the formula below: 
 
Pr
ice = Cost per machine/ yield per machine
 
Cost per machine is on a Dollar basis, and yield per machine is on a Bitcoin basis.

The firm, which administers assets worth nearl","The firm, which administers assets worth nearly $1.5 trillion, disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that it intends to list such a fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange.

The document indicates that the Franklin Bitcoin ETF would be a'series' within the Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust.

It aims to'typically reflect the bitcoin price performance before the fund's expenses are deducted.' The ETF's shares would be secured by bitcoin held by the fund's custodian, Coinbase Custody Trust Company.

A Franklin Templeton representative declined to comment beyond the filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)) is presently considering a large number of similar applications.

Ark and 21Shares refiled for a spot bitcoin ETF in April, roughly two months before BlackRock announced intentions to launch a comparable product.

BlackRock's participation in the pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF prompted Fidelity, Invesco, Bitwise, and a few other issuers to retry their efforts.

Though issuers have long sought to introduce a bitcoin-backed ETF to themarket, the SEC has never permitted one to begin trading.

Grayscale Investments won a case against the SEC in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals a few weeks before Franklin Templeton's filing.

The judges in that case said the SEC's denial of Grayscale's conversion of its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF while allowing bitcoin futures ETFs to come to market was'arbitrary and capricious.

Although the decision does not compel the SEC to sanction the GBTC conversion, the judges informed the agency that it could not deny the conversion for the reasons it had previously cited.

Some industry observers said that the ruling increased the likelihood that the SEC would eventually authorize a spot bitcoin ETF, possibly by the end of the year.

The decision prompted Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, for example, to increase the probability of Bitcoin ETF approval by the end of 2023 from 65% to 75%.

In an August research note, analysts predicted a 95% chance that such a product would launch in the United States by the end of 2024 .",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/12/C_e0b6bimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.452196,1fb2b4096e1a5aa5f53ed56dc25a17dd

Since their inception with Bitcoin in the late 2000s, cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially, reshaping traditional financial paradigms. This transformative journey, while innovative, brings forth pressing concerns about their energy consumption and carbon footprint. While many studies tend to zoom in on Bitcoin, this paper broadens the perspective by evaluating energy consumption across various cryptocurrencies. We analyze nine cryptocurrency projects, chosen for their market value, technology, and data availability. These span a spectrum from pioneering to emerging digital coins, offering a holistic view of the crypto realm. To contextualize, we juxtapose the energy usage of these digital currencies with traditional payment means like Visa and Mastercard. Our analysis shows vast differences in energy use among cryptocurrencies, largely tied to their consensus algorithms. Notably, while Bitcoin stands out as highly energy-intensive, several newer digital currencies have energy footprints mirroring those of conventional payment methods. Additionally, CO
2
 emissions estimation presents challenges due to variances in miner locations and regional energy sources, with potential higher emissions if concentrated in carbon-intensive regions like China. Nonetheless, the silver lining emerges as many cryptocurrencies, especially those beyond Bitcoin, register considerably lower CO
2
 emissions. By moving the lens beyond Bitcoin, this paper paints a more nuanced picture of the environmental ramifications of the crypto world.


 










 


Digital assets that combine cash and cryptography are known as cryptocurrencies. Peer-to-peer networks and public blockchains are frequently the foundations of cryptocurrencies, allowing network participants to validate financial transactions [
1
]. The majority of cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which has several benefits over conventional centralized financial systems, including quick transactions and minimal transaction fees [
2
]. Since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be established back in 2008, the terms, cryptocurrency (decentralized digital assets that use cryptographic functions) and digital coin (centralized digital assets), are frequently used interchangeably [
3
]. The cryptocurrency market has grown since the introduction of Bitcoin, and as of now, there are over 17,000 distinct cryptocurrency projects, of which, over 9000 are active [
4
]. There were more than 1800 full-time workers and a market value of over 
$
1.7 trillion for cryptocurrencies in February 2022 [
4
]. Controversy remains regarding whether cryptocurrencies should be considered a method of payment or a high-risk investment. The interest in cryptocurrencies has largely risen in recent years, despite some criticism of their volatility [
5
]. Cryptocurrencies are both lauded as decentralized transaction mediums and debated due to barriers like limited everyday use and regulatory challenges. While they promise a decentralized payment alternative, their role as a primary payment method remains contested. Additionally, cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have gained attention as speculative investments, promising high rewards. However, their marked price volatility raises concerns about their stability and value, leading some to question their reliability as a store of wealth. Despite skepticism, the increasing appeal of cryptocurrencies is fueled by factors like institutional acceptance, blockchain advancements, distrust in traditional banking, and global digitization. This positions them prominently in financial discourse [
6
].
Concerns about cryptocurrencies' excessive power usage have been raised by their expanding marketplaces [
7
]. Because of the notoriously energy-intensive roof of Work consensus method used by Bitcoin, some studies have calculated that the network's electricity consumption is comparable to that of whole countries like Ireland and Austria [
8
]. Since Bitcoin dominates the crypto markets and accounts for 41.9% of market value, several research have concentrated on it (20 February 2022) [
4
]. To place the energy use and CO
2
 emissions of cryptocurrencies in the present and the future, however, a correct perspective on the crypto markets beyond Bitcoin and Proof of Work is required as the market share for new projects increases [
9
].
Recent decades have seen an increase in both worldwide energy consumption and CO
2
 emissions [
10
], and according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CO
2
 emissions from the generation of electricity in 2021 grew globally by 7% [
11
]. The energy use and carbon impact of the Bitcoin marketplace are also expanding. However, new projects using novel consensus algorithms, such as Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Algorand, Chia Network, may be employed to grow markets without endangering the environment [
12
].
In recent years, alongside the meteoric rise and adoption of cryptocurrencies, there has been growing discourse concerning their ecological implications. The decentralized nature of these digital assets, while groundbreaking in many respects, has also been a source of concern from an environmental standpoint [
13
]. Cryptocurrency operations, especially those utilizing energy-intensive consensus algorithms like Proof of Work, have been linked to significant energy consumption, often sourced from non-renewable power plants, resulting in substantial carbon footprints. As digital assets become more integrated into our global financial systems, it is crucial to holistically understand and address their environmental impacts. This study seeks to shed light on this pertinent issue by exploring various cryptocurrency projects and their ecological ramifications.
Because various cryptocurrencies have varying consensus procedures and technology requirements, it has proven challenging to quantify the energy usage of cryptocurrencies. While it is true that the decentralized nature of blockchain networks makes it inherently difficult to determine the precise location and energy sources of all nodes and miners, advancements in surveillance and regulations have allowed certain states to identify and monitor major mining operations. Nevertheless, given the global and dispersed nature of the network, obtaining a comprehensive and exact calculation of the resource and energy mix powering every node remains a challenge. Localized data may be available in regions with concentrated mining activities, but a complete global overview remains elusive.
The following research question is used to study and analyze the current cryptocurrency marketplaces outside of Bitcoin as well as the energy use and carbon footprint of cryptocurrency projects: how do the energy consumption and CO
2
 emissions of diverse cryptocurrency projects, driven by their underlying consensus algorithms, compare to traditional payment methods, and what influence do financial determinants, especially in the context of Bitcoin, have on these environmental metrics?
More in-depth analysis of the technology used in various projects would have been outside the purview of this study. This study explores cryptocurrency from an ecological standpoint. Nine distinct projects were chosen due to the vast number of cryptocurrencies, on the basis of their market size, consensus method, and data accessibility. The secondary energy used in producing and cooling hardware is not considered because of a lack of information.
There are six sections in this paper. 
Section 2
 introduces blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, while 
Section 3
 does the same for consensus algorithms and a few specific crypto projects. The energy consumption of the projects is reviewed in the fourth section, and in the fifth section, energy consumption and CO
2
 emissions of cryptocurrency projects are discussed. The results of this investigation are summarized in 
Section 6
.
Our study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of data gathered from blockchain networks and qualitative analysis of academic literature, industry reports, and expert opinions on the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. Data were collected from prominent blockchain explorers, while peer-reviewed articles and industry publications provided insights into consensus algorithms, energy consumption patterns, and CO
2
 emissions ratings.
This review paper delves into specific environmental implications of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency projects. While there are various environmental facets to consider with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, our primary lens for this research is on their energy consumption patterns and resultant carbon footprints. It is essential to clarify that this study neither provides financial nor investment advice. Consequently, while our research emphasizes environmental impacts, it does not delve into the economic performance, volatility, security, or reliability of cryptocurrencies. Readers should not interpret the information presented herein as guidance for financial or investment decisions.
Despite the fact that the technology may be applied in various contexts, the majority of cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, and blockchains are frequently linked to cryptocurrencies. A ledger or chain of blocks used to store data might be referred to as a blockchain [
14
]. Transactions, data records, and executables may all be included in the data kept on the blockchain. A blockchain is made up of transactions that are combined into blocks using encryption in the case of conventional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The chain is created by cryptographically connecting each block to the one before it. A so-called ‘peer-to-peer' (P2P) network is then created, with the chain being maintained by nodes and distributed to all network users. If the block's data are changed later, the chain will ‘break', since the block's encryption has changed. 
Figure 1
 depicts the operation of a blockchain [
15
].
Blockchain technology is used by cryptocurrencies to keep track of network transactions and to establish consensus among users. Blockchains may be grouped according to their many characteristics. Blockchains can be public, private, or somewhere in between, with or without permissions. Anyone can publish blocks without a third party's approval in a permissionless blockchain network [
16
]. The majority of these blockchains are constructed on top of them and are open-source and freely accessible to everyone. The permissionless blockchain network allows all users to read from and write to the ledger, and the blockchain is open to all network participants. Permissionless blockchain networks frequently utilize a multiparty agreement or consensus method with certain restrictions for users who seek to publish blocks in order to avoid abuse and efforts to publish fraudulent blocks [
17
]. Later in this work, several of these consensus algorithms are covered.
On the other hand, before releasing blocks, centralized or decentralized authors must provide their approval in permissioned blockchain networks [
17
]. Given that the creator controls who has access to and control over the network, read access and submitting transactions may or may not be prohibited in a network like this. The majority of these networks employ consensus techniques for publishing blocks; thus, permissioned networks can nonetheless have the same openness and traceability as permissionless networks. Due to the administrators' preexisting degree of confidence inside the network, consensus techniques utilized in permissioned networks frequently have less requirements than in permissionless networks. Due to the lack of complex consensus mechanisms, permissioned blockchain networks are frequently quicker and less computationally costly.
The majority of cryptocurrencies, including the two biggest, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are public blockchain instances. Everyone on the blockchain network may read transaction information on a public blockchain, making it accessible to all users. Public blockchains are intended to be completely transparent and decentralized, which means that no one and nothing is in charge of them. The system is maintained via the peer-to-peer network, which also verifies new blocks added to the chain. Due to the widespread distribution of users and the blockchain, public blockchain networks are resilient to single points of failure. The blockchain network can continue to function even if one of its servers is offline since the others are still running [
18
]. Without a single point of authority, the network must use consensus techniques to reach agreement on verifying transactions and new blocks [
14
]. Permissioned and permissionless public blockchain are both possible.
Private blockchains are more centralized than public blockchains since they are used to transfer data between corporations, for instance. Private blockchains are permissioned networks because the data they store are not publicly accessible. The blockchain economy is only accessible to authorized parties. Not all private blockchains have a token [
18
]. Although some cryptocurrencies have features a the public blockchain and some, of a private blockchain, they are not entirely decentralized.
Within the expanding realm of blockchain technology, the introduction of ‘smart contracts' and ‘decentralized apps (dApps)' stands out as a transformative innovation. At its core, a smart contract is a self-executing contract embedded with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller. These terms are written into lines of code, which reside on the blockchain network. What sets smart contracts apart is their ability to automatically execute or enforce themselves when specific, pre-defined conditions or criteria are met, without the need for intermediaries [
19
]. Decentralized apps, commonly known as dApps, leverage the principles of smart contracts and are applications that run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers [
20
]. Unlike traditional applications that run on centralized servers, dApps are inherently resistant to tampering and censorship due to their decentralized nature. These applications function without a central authority, thus enhancing their security and potentially reducing risks of censorship or control by a single entity. In the contemporary digital landscape, dApps have found diverse applications ranging from decentralized social media platforms to gaming ecosystems, and their operation is underpinned by the automatic execution feature of smart contracts.
The underlying idea behind hash functions, which have been around for a while in computer science, is to compress any type of string into an output string with a fixed length [
21
]. To protect and compress data, a block uses hash algorithms. Given only the output value and a cryptographic hash function, it is computationally impossible to determine the input value [
17
].

This paper proposes a unified framework for the detection of statistically significant changes in time series related to Bitcoin transactions. The time locations of these changes are linked to the occurrences of events which could be further investigated aiming to reveal potential illicit activity. The proposed framework includes: (a) the extraction of 28 features of interest in the form of time series from the Bitcoin transaction history; (b) the selection of features among the extracted ones based on the 
Partition Around Medoids
 clustering approach; and (c) the change point analysis of the multivariate time series which is formulated by the medoid time series of each cluster. This analysis enables the identification of structural breaks in the underlying behavior of the time series of interest at certain time points. The proposed framework is applied on the Bitcoin transactions of two entities that have been involved in illicit activities, namely 
Pirate@40
, who orchestrated a high-yield investment programme, and the 
MintPal
 Bitcoin exchange platform that was hacked. The analysis results indicate that the estimated change points can be linked to certain event occurrences which may affect the transaction activity and could be further investigated for potential links to illicit actions.


 










 


Bitcoin has known meteoric rise in its popularity since its creation in 2008, constituting a lucrative market reaching up to more than USD 1.2 trillion
1
 over the years. In contrast to traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on administrative institutions, such as banks, to ensure trust, but rather on the transparency of its transactions. All Bitcoin transactions are stored on the blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, and are publicly available. However, despite its inherent transparency, Bitcoin offers pseudo-anonymity to its users since Bitcoin transactions are not linked to entities but to Bitcoin addresses; thus, there is no direct connection to the entities that participate to the transactions. Due to this characteristic, as well as the ease of access it offers, Bitcoin has been used for a number of illicit activities, ranging from Ponzi schemes to black markets (see, for example, 
Sándor and Fehér 2019
).
Bitcoin forensics capitalise on the vast amount of available transaction data in the blockchain (more than 480 GB of transactions accumulated to date
2
) with the goal to detect illicit activities. Such approaches typically analyse Bitcoin transactions by extracting several features aiming to determine whether they are related to criminal actions. The majority of existing methods employ classification models to infer whether an address is involved in illicit activities by extracting static features, i.e., without considering the evolution over time (
Oliveira et al. 2021
; 
Ranshous et al. 2017
; 
Toyoda et al. 2017
; 
Yang et al. 2022
). In particular, most commonly, the whole timeline of transactions related to an address is summarised into static features; for example, the transaction volume of an address over the whole activity duration is typically summarised into a single value (
Farrugia et al. 2020
; 
Lin et al. 2019
; 
Toyoda et al.
 
2017
, 
2018a
, 
2019
). However, this approach fails to capture the dynamic evolution of features of interest over time, which may add further valuable insights to the analysis of the history of transactions, thus enabling additional inferences regarding specific addresses and transactions in real time and not only retrospectively.
This paper focuses on the analysis of temporal features extracted from a Bitcoin transaction history enabling the use of time series analysis approaches to identify changes in the temporal behaviour. In particular, our work proposes a framework for the detection of time locations in the time series of features extracted from Bitcoin transactions that may signify the occurrence of events in which further attention should be paid to. This approach could serve as a digital forensics tool for the analysis of Bitcoin transactions assisting in the identification of possible causes that may have affected the transaction activity.
The proposed framework comprises three steps. At first, several features (namely 28 features) are extracted from the transaction history on a wallet basis aiming to capture as much information as possible about these transactions and add further value to the analysis. The values of the features are aggregated at specific time steps resulting in the depiction of their dynamic evolution and the creation of time series. Then, the relevant time series are grouped into clusters in order to perform feature selection and remove overlapping information. Finally, the medoids of the formulated clusters constitute the input to the change point analysis method so as to estimate time locations of statistically significant changes in a multivariate time series; this analysis enables the identification of potential relationships between time locations and event incidents that could have influenced the changes observed in the transaction activity. Moreover, the use of a multivariate change point detection (CPD) approach compared to a univariate one allows the exploitation of possible correlations that may exist between the different features.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables the use of change point analysis approaches in temporal features extracted from Bitcoin transactions with the goal to estimate the time instances where significant changes occur in the evolution of the time series of interest. The proposed framework covers the whole pipeline from feature extraction and selection, up to the final implementation of the multivariate CPD. The applicability of the proposed framework is evaluated by analysing two notable Bitcoin entities: 
Pirate@40
, who was involved in a high-yield investment programme (HYIP) scam, and the 
MintPal
 exchange platform that was hacked. Of course, it can be applied to any other crypto entity, apart from Bitcoin. The analysis results are promising as the effectiveness of the proposed framework is justified by succeeding in the detection of structural breaks in the time series of interest of both entities at time locations which are related to incidents that are worthy of further attention and may be linked to illicit actions.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2
 presents the related work with particular focus on time series analysis applied on cryptocurrency data, as well as methods used for classifying addresses involved in crypto transactions as illicit. 
Section 3
 details the proposed framework, while 
Section 4
 showcases its applicability. In 
Section 5
, the results are discussed, and, finally, 
Section 6
, summarises the main findings and provides directions for future work.
Time series analysis approaches have been widely applied on cryptocurrency data aiming at the fitting of models and the provision of forecasts related to their prices. In 
Azari
 (
2019
), the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been applied to predict the future value of Bitcoin by using the closing prices of a three-year period starting from 1 September 2015. This work indicated that the proposed model is effective over sub-periods in which the relevant time series has an unchanged trend, especially for short-term predictions. The ARIMA forecast is compared with a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach described in 
Fleischer et al.
 (
2022
); 
McNally et al.
 (
2018
). In these cases, the LSTM model achieves a better accuracy compared to the ARIMA one, having the tradeoff of longer execution time. Comparative studies about the use of time series analysis approaches in predicting crypto prices can be found in 
Ibrahim et al.
 (
2021
) and 
Tan and Kashef
 (
2019
). An important feature that can be taken into consideration when modelling the time series of crypto prices is the existence of time varying volatility. For this purpose, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models have been used to fit the relevant time series. For example, in 
Chu et al.
 (
2017
) twelve GARCH-type models are fitted to seven cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin, Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Maidsafecoin, Monero, and Ripple) and the goodness of fit is assessed using information criteria that utilise the likelihood function of the data based on the different models, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
The detection of illicit activities from cryptocurrencies has been studied focusing mainly on approaches where 
static features
 are extracted from the cryptocurrency transactions, i.e., features that do not capture variation over time. 
Toyoda et al.
 (
2017
, 
2019
) studied the identification of a type of fraudulent investment program called high-yield investment programmes (HYIPs) by analysing Bitcoin transactions. They classified Bitcoin addresses as HYIP-related using the XGBoost and random forest methods on a limited number of static features, such as frequency of transactions, number of total transactions, and the mean value of addresses per transaction. Moreover, they utilised an address clustering methodology based on heuristics that allows for multiple addresses to be grouped based on ownership. The same authors followed a similar approach in 
Toyoda et al.
 (
2018a
) to classify Bitcoin addresses into multiple usage types (i.e., Exchange, Faucet, Gambling, HYIP, Marketplace, Mixer, and Mining pool) formulating a multi-class problem compared to the previous binary classification. In addition, 
Farrugia et al.
 (
2020
) studied the detection of illicit addresses from Ethereum blockchain transactions. They extracted 42 static features and used XGBoost to classify the addresses as normal or illicit. Finally, 
Lin et al.
 (
2019
) extracted static features along with four new 'transaction moments' in a multi-class classification problem. These moments summarise the transactions distribution into singular values which represent the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the transactions.
Another approach for detecting illicit activities with static features is to use graph analysis methodologies. For example, 
Ranshous et al.
 (
2017
) modelled Bitcoin transactions as a hypergraph and identified graph motifs. Additionally, they extracted graph-based statistical features (e.g., out-degree, total in-weight, etc.) that were used in their classification model as exchange addresses that are possibly involved in money laundering/Bitcoin mixing. 
Oliveira et al.
 (
2021
) proposed GuiltyWalker, a method that performs random walks on a Bitcoin address network and extracts features based on the distance from illicit nodes. Subsequently, they used the graph features along with other static ones to classify the addresses as illicit or not. 
Yang et al.
 (
2022
) generated four-hop subgraphs for specific time periods along with a set of features for each subgraph. Subsequently, they aggregated the features (using e.g., average, max) and employed them in a classification task with the labels: 
Gambling
, 
Darknet Market
, and 
Tumbler
.
One avenue to enrich the Bitcoin transaction features is to consider how they change over time allowing for the exploitation of 
dynamic features
. By doing so, the temporal component of the features is captured and the use of time series analysis approaches is enabled. For example, 
Toyoda et al.
 (
2018b
) extracted four dynamic features on Bitcoin transactions of a known HYIP operator and constructed the corresponding time series. They used a sliding window of seven days with one day shift for the calculation of the features. Then, an anomaly score based on principal component analysis was calculated per time step based on the relevant dynamic features. 
Li et al.
 (
2020
) also extracted temporal features in order to identify illicit addresses. They initially constructed some temporal structures from time series and subsequently used an LSTM auto-encoder to codify them into discriminative temporal features. They combined the temporal features with static and topological ones to classify the addresses as illicit or not. Finally, 
Weber et al.
 (
2019
) combined temporal, graph, and static features to classify addresses as illicit in a binary classification problem. They divided the time horizon into multiple time steps and extracted features for each step akin to forming time series.
Our work also focuses on the exploitation of dynamic features related to crypto transactions in order to gain further insights to the transaction history. Particularly, the adopted approach presents a unified framework for revealing possible links between time locations and event occurrences that may have triggered changes in transaction activity, providing digital forensics practitioners a tool to identify possible trends and patterns that could reveal illicit actions. Towards this direction, a multivariate change point detection method is used to analyse the dynamic evolution of features of interest and identify changes that may indicate the occurrence of events, where further attention should be paid to. Our approach shares some similarities with the work of 
Toyoda et al.
 (
2018b
). In particular, both approaches aim to detect behaviour irregularities by extracting temporal features from cryptocurrency transactions. Moreover, the applicability of both methods is illustrated using the 
Pirate@40
 transactions. However, the two works exhibit also distinct differences. More specifically, in our approach the list of extracted features is expanded (i.e., 28 features compared to 4) in order to capture a more comprehensive overview of the transaction activity. Due to the extended list of features, we add a feature selection step so as to eliminate the overlapping information and reduce the computational cost of the analysis. Moreover, we proceed with the analysis of the time series of interest via a change point detection method instead of an anomaly score algorithm. Finally, we apply our approach on the whole 
Pirate@40
 dataset and not a part of it, compared to 
Toyoda et al.
 (
2018b
), as well as on the 
MintPal
 transactions.
This section describes the steps of the proposed change point detection (CPD) framework for the identification of statistically significant change points in the history of Bitcoin transactions that may be linked to the occurrences of events which should be further analysed (e.g., in the context of digital forensics). In particular, 
Section 3.1
 describes the methodology for the extraction of 28 time series features from the Bitcoin transaction history. Then, 
Section 3.2
 presents the approach that is followed for selecting features among the extracted ones based on the clustering of the relevant time series. Finally, 
Section 3.3
 describes the CPD algorithm that is used for the estimation of statistically significant changes in the multivariate time series of interest that is formulated by the selected features. 
Figure 1
 illustrates the overview of the proposed framework.
The proposed framework takes as input the wallet transactions of an entity of interest. A wallet in this context is defined as a set of Bitcoin addresses that are associated with a single entity. The wallet transactions can provide a better overview of the activity of an entity compared to individual addresses, since the latter ones are typically used only temporarily. In the context of this work, wallet transactions were used as extracted by the website 
www.walletexplorer.com
 (accessed on 14 July 2023).
In order to simplify the wallet transactions, the amounts that originate and end up at the same wallet are ignored; the same approach was also followed in 
Toyoda et al.
 (
2018b
). For example, if addresses A, B, and D (see 
Figure 2
) are known to belong to the same wallet, then the amount 




0.6




 can be ignored since it ends up at the same wallet from which it originated.
Typically, the majority of addresses are not directly associated with an entit; however, there are some heuristic methods that can infer the addresses used by the same entity. In particular, these heuristics are used in a process called 
address clustering
, which starts from a limited number of addresses and identifies addresses that are likely to belong to same entity based on their interactions. For example, 
Figure 3
 shows a transaction where Address A is co-spending with Address B; this indicates that likely both addresses A and B are controlled by the same entity. In the context of this work, no further address clustering took place; for an overview of address clustering methods, please see the work of 
Zhang et al.
 (
2020
) and 
He et al.
 (
2022
).
Once the addresses used by the same entity are aggregated into a wallet, the features listed in 
Table 1
 are extracted from the corresponding transactions. The values of each feature are calculated at certain time steps (e.g., once per day) in order to generate the respective time series that capture the evolution of the wallet activity over time.

However, Whale Analysis cautioned that the market leader's pricing may be susceptible to a correction in the coming weeks.

According to the post, the cryptocurrency's value could return to the $25,000 range if it fails to maintain its position above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA).

Bitcoin technically traded above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), around $26,306.92.

In addition, the 9-day EMA was also endeavoring to cross above the 20-day EMA. Should these two technical indicators cross, a significant bullish technical flag will be activated.

This particular technical flag will indicate a shift in short-term momentum in favor of purchasers.

Consequently, the dominant cryptocurrency's price may rise within 24–48 hours. Should this bullish technical flag be confirmed, BTC may attempt to turn the $26,917.47 resistance level into support.

Subsequently, sustained buy support may cause BTC's price to rise to the $27,400 level indicated in today's post by Whale Analysis.

A break below the 20-day exponential moving average, however, will invalidate the bullish thesis. In this scenario, the dominant cryptocurrency's price may lose support at $26,000, resulting in BTC trading in the $25,000–$26,000 range.

CoinMarketCap indicated that Bitcoin was trading at $26,550.76 at publication. This occurred after the cryptocurrency posted a 24-hour increase of 0.23 percent.

In addition, this most recent increase in BTC's price contributed to the cryptocurrency's weekly performance , bringing it to +2.71%.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/18/C_e3732image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.453678,02e439a98054d578a55211a634ba59fb

372,Next Bitcoin Peak: Why It Could Still Be 2 Years Away,predycto,2023-09-19 00:00:57,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/next-bitcoin-peak-why-it-could-still-be-2-years-away/,newsbtc.com,"Bitcoin's price is 26500, more than 60% down from its all-time high of 69000. History shows the next Bitcoin peak could be in two years","Bitcoin's last all-time high was $69,000 in November 2021; as of September 2023, it's been 22 months since that peak. While estimating what price Bitcoin could reach 
next
 can be very useful, it's also important to estimate when a new peak could occur.


History suggests this may still be some time away, as analysis shows that the next Bitcoin peak could arise around the end of 2025.


Previous Cycles


A specific pattern seems to occur when looking at previous tops and bottoms. The three previous bottoms, January 2015, December 2018, and November 2022, were all exactly 47 months apart. Similarly, the previous three tops, November 2013, December 2017, and November 2021, are either 49 or 47 months apart.


Market participants could anticipate the next Bitcoin peak around October-December 2025 if this pattern persists. The subsequent bottom could then occur around October 2026.




Source BTCUSD on 
TradingView.com


This phenomenon of tops and bottoms forming cyclically is a widely held belief in investing. Both stock markets and economies are believed to experience periods of expansion, marked by increased economic activity and rising stock market prices, and contraction, during which the stock market prices decline, and economic growth slows.


What's particularly interesting about Bitcoin is its consistent pattern of forming its tops and bottoms roughly every four years. The ‘halving theory' is a popular explanation for this observed pattern.
 
The Halving Theory


Approximately every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a 
‘halving'
 event, during which the reward for mining new blocks (i.e. the new supply of Bitcoin) is halved. This mechanism ensures the scarcity of Bitcoin, which is capped at a maximum supply of 21 million coins. A simple economic principle suggests that prices rise when supply drops while demand stays constant or grows.


Historically, Bitcoin has reached a new peak a year after each halving. Given that the next halving is projected to be in April 2024, it aligns with the chart above, showing the next Bitcoin peak to be around the end of 2025.
 
Next Bitcoin Peak – Will This Time Be Different?


While historical data points provide valuable insights into the potential future performance of an asset, it's crucial to understand that history does not always exactly repeat itself – it often rhymes. This suggests that while certain patterns from the past might re-emerge, they don't necessarily play out in the same way.


Various factors, such as technological advances, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory changes, can introduce differences.


In the current market scenario, Bitcoin is navigating through a high-inflation and high-interest-rate environment for the first time. These conditions can lower market 
liquidity
 as investors might have reduced capital available for investment.


Additionally, faced with such an environment, many investors could turn to savings or 
bonds
, which may present more attractive and stable returns than other assets.

The study by cryptocurrency experts Marketplace Fairness analyzed Google searches worldwide for a number of Bitcoin alternative cryptocurrencies to see which were the most popular worldwide in 2023.

It found that Ethereum is currently leading all Bitcoin alternatives in popularity, with 3,260,000 searches for the currency worldwide every month. It was founded in 2015, over five years after Bitcoin, and is proving to be more popular globally than some of its older counterparts.

Dogecoin comes in second place on the list as the most popular 'Meme coin' worldwide, with 1,659,000 monthly searches for it. The currency has been rising recently, having seen a mention in Walter Isaacson's newly released Elon Musk biography.

XRP comes in third place, with cryptocurrency seeing around 1,250,000 searches for it each month worldwide. It's the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network and was launched in 2012, making it one of the older entries on the list.

Coming in fourth place is another 'Meme coin' in Shiba Inu , which attracts around 678,000 searches worldwide. It was founded in August 2020 and saw its peak price in October 2021, when its value rose by a whopping 240% in a week.

""Historic Milestone: Bitcoin processed a record-breaking 703K transactions on Friday,"" the firm posted on X.

Moreover, the network also saw an increase in the number of daily active addresses.

According to the data from Bitinforcharts, the number of daily active addresses reached a multi-month high on September 15, rising from 754,000 two years ago to a whopping 1.08 million.

A day earlier, Ethereum briefly crossed Bitcoin in terms of daily active addresses.

In April, Bitcoin trading volume sank by almost $700 billion, historically seen as one of the strongest months for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, bringing the biggest average monthly returns.

Although Bitcoin topped over $30,400 on April 18, reaching the highest level since early June, its monthly gain was only 3 per cent, way down from 21 per cent in March and much less than gains usually seen in the fourth month of the year, according to data by BitcoinCasinos.com.

According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin's monthly trading volume amounted to $492.9 billion in April, a massive 58 per cent less than almost $1.2 trillion seen a month before.

Sell the BTC/US pair and set a take-profit at 25,000.

Add a stop-loss at 27,000. Timeline: 1-2 days.



Buy the BTC/USD pair and set a take-profit at 27,000. Add a stop-loss at 25,500.

Bullish view

Bitcoin held quite well this week even as a risk-off sentiment continued and the fear and greed index crashed. The BTC/USD pair was trading at 26,000 on Wednesday, the lowest level since September 14. This price is much higher than this month's low of 24,950.Fear and greed index retreats

A sense of fear has engulfed the financial market in the past few days. As a result, the fear and greed index has dropped to the fear zone of 30. In most periods, stocks and cryptocurrencies crash when investors are increasingly fearful.

This sense of fear has been exemplified by the performance of the US dollar. The dollar index has jumped to $106, the highest level in months. Similarly, the price of crude oil has moved by more than 20% from the lowest point in June this year.

American stocks have also slumped in the past few weeks. The Dow Jones index crashed by more than 400 points on Tuesday, the worst day in months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices have crashed by more than 8% from their highest points this year.

Therefore, it is quite surprising that Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have remained steady in the past few days. Most notably, Bitcoin has remained above the important support level at $26,000.

The risk-off sentiment has happened because of the hawkish Federal Reserve. In its meeting last week, the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%. It also pointed to an additional hike later this year.

If this hike happens, it will happen at a time when risks to the American economy are rising. Mortgage rates are approaching 8%, default rates are rising, and consumer confidence is slipping.BTC/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been moving downwards in the past few weeks. In this period, the pair has dropped below the 50-period moving average while the MACD has moved below the neutral point. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued moving in a downward trend.

Bitcoin has remained below the Ichimoku cloud. Therefore, the BTC/USD price will likely remain in this range and then make a bearish breakout. If this happens, the next key support to watch will be at 25,000. The alternative scenario is where the pair rebounds to the resistance at 27,000.

The invalid block was first 
picked
 by an X user, '0xB10C', before Jameson Lopp, the CTO of Casa, a Bitcoin-focused company, later 
confirmed
 it. 


Lopp scanned his node and noted that MARA Pool had spent an output before it was created, validating a double-spent transaction. 


Bitcoin transaction ordering| Source: 0xB10C on X


Marathon Digital Mined An Invalid Block


In Bitcoin, a mining pool or an individual miner can't approve an 'illegal' transaction originating from any network user. By double-spending, the user posting the transaction tries to cheat the system. 
 
Bitcoin is self-auditing, and every miner and mining pool connected to the network must always confirm that all transactions in the latest block and attached to the longest chain are valid. If a block contains an invalid transaction not supported by other miners, it will be rejected. This was the case with the block 
verified
 by MARA Pool; other miners automatically dismissed it and didn't build on it.


BitMEX Research findings 
show
 that the block was disregarded because of a transaction ordering problem. In Bitcoin, miners decide the order of transactions within a block based on the fees attached. 


All these transactions are picked from the mempool, a temporary storage for all unconfirmed transactions. While they can arrange them in any order, this changes once the block is confirmed after its cryptographic puzzle is solved. 
 
Ensuring transactions are ordered chronologically makes Bitcoin resistant to double-spending, which can destroy a public network's credibility. Bitcoin prevents this by automatically proving that only a particular transaction was the first to be confirmed on the network, invalidating any other.


Bitcoin Remains Volatile


The event also coincided with heightened Bitcoin volatility. At September 27 highs, the coin had soared to as high as $27,263 and remains capped inside a $1,000 range, looking at price action in the daily chart. 


Nonetheless, the surge was quickly met with strong rejections. The coin fell sharply from today's highs, and an inverted hammer forms in the daily chart. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin is roughly up 5% from September lows. Buyers have the upper hand since prices are trending inside the bullish range established in the second and third weeks of the month.

Presently, prices are trending above the primary support at around $26,000. Looking at price trends in the past few weeks, the path of least resistance is southwards despite the recent revival.

Set a buy-stop at 26,550 and a take-profit at 27,477. Add a stop-loss at 25,760.

Bullish view

Bitcoin price has held quite well in the past few days. The BTC/USD pair has remained above the key support at 26,000 since September 13th. It has dropped by ~4.13% from its highest level this month.Market risks rise

The BTC/USD pair has moved sideways in the past few weeks. It has outperformed stocks as the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 have retreated by more than 7% from the highest levels this year.

It has also done better than bonds. The 10-year, 30-year, and 5-year bond yields have jumped to the highest levels in years. Bond yields move inversely to prices. They have risen in the past few months as the Federal Reserve has moved aggressively to fight against inflation.

The US dollar index (DXY) has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few weeks. It has risen to over $105.6, the highest level in more than 6 months. Historically, Bitcoin tends to have an inverse relationship with the US dollar.

It is not clear why Bitcoin is doing well in this environment. A likely reason is that there are still hopes that the Securities and Exchange Commission (ECB) will approve at least one of the spot ETF proposals. Several large companies like Blackrock, Invesco, and WisdomTree have filed for their spot ETFs.

A Bitcoin ETF will be positive for the ecosystem since it will lead to more inflows from institutional investors. Another important event is the ongoing Bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy. The company bought 5,445 coins valued at over $150 million. It now holds coins worth over $4.6 billion in Bitcoins.BTC/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has held quite well in the past days as American stocks retreated recently. The BTC/USD pair retreated to a low of 25,990 and then bounced back to a high of 26,417. It has moved slightly below the 50-period moving average while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) drifted upwards.

The pair remains below the Ichimoku cloud. Therefore, the pair will likely remain in this range in the coming days as investors target the key support at 25,760. The stop-loss of this trade will be at 27,000.

Move the stop loss to break even once the trade is $100 in profit by price. Take off 50% of the position as profit when the trade is $100 in profit by price and leave the remainder of the position to ride.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels.BTC/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis on 18th September that both the levels at $26,440 and $26,906 looked reliable, but I thought the long trade would be a better opportunity if it set up.

This did not work out very well and did not produce any good trades, but I was correct to look on the long side.

Markets are seeing a lot of risk-off movement right now, with the US Dollar powering ahead against most major currencies.

It is therefore notable that Bitcoin does not seem to be falling against the US Dollar, although the price is just going sideways. If anything, I suspect an upwards price movement beyond the current range is suggested as more likely than a downwards one from the recent price action.

Despite that, I think that Bitcoin is really looking quite dull for traders, beyond possible scalps from reversals at either $25,986 or $26,534.

Concerning the US Dollar, there will be a release of Final GDP and Unemployment Claims data at 1:30pm London time.

After touching the mid-September highs, suddenly BTC/USD began to cascade lower. BTC/USD hit 26,500.00 on Thursday the 21st. Last week saw the consolidated lower price realm remain in sight.

Trading this week started off with a flurry higher on Sunday when BTC/USD momentarily went towards the 26,700.00 mark, but again a reversal lower developed and as of this writing Bitcoin is trading near 26,200.00 with behavioral sentiment looking flustered and perhaps weak. The ability to break through resistance in late June and create a high of nearly 31,820.00 on the 13th of July, has developed a stark bearish trend once again which has become troubling for Bitcoin backers.Monitoring the Lower Support Levels in BTC/USD

On September 11th BTC/USD did hit a low of nearly 24,940.00. The ability of Bitcoin to break through the 25,000.00 ratio briefly and then produce a solid move upward until the 19th of September is noteworthy. However, the upward movement has seemingly run out of gas and until a sincere amount of bullish momentum can be generated again it appears support near the 26,000.00 looks like a potential target for speculators.



Support near the 26,000.00 level must be watched. If this ratio is penetrated lower and prices are sustained beneath it could signal additional selling in BTC/USD could develop.

If BTC/USD were to suffer a stiff selloff in the near term and add to the rather nervous sentiment that exists in the cryptocurrency world now, bearish traders may believe a strong wave lower can be produced again. Traders should not get overly ambitious regarding their targets for BTC/USD in either direction. Digital asset moves like lightning sometimes and is not easy to pursue trades unless a speculator can absorb a great deal of volatility.

Day traders of BTC/USD need to use entry orders with an exact price when attempting to pursue the digital asset for speculation. If an entry order is not used the price fill received by the trader may not be what was anticipated. Traders also need to use an extremely conservative amount of leverage if they are wagering in fast conditions because the change of a handful of 'pips' can shatter a trading account if a speculator cannot afford moves that go against the chosen direction.Trading the 26,000.00 Ratio for Sustained Moves LowerBitcoin Short-Term Outlook:

This decline has extend","(MENAFN- Investor Ideas) Amid a state of economic uncertainty globally, Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges have witnessed a significant drop in trading volumes. This decline has extended over the past few months, with daily Bitcoin trading volumes reaching levels not seen since 2018. Additionally, we've observed that over-the-counter Bitcoin exchange transactions have fluctuated between $8,000 and $15,000 in the past week, a stark contrast to the average daily price of Bitcoin. This decrease in volume coincides with Bitcoin's price movement staying within the range of $25,000 to $26,000 for several months.

I believe the drop in trading volumes is due to the global economic instability. However, actions taken by the US Federal Reserve have heightened concerns and a persistent sense of market uncertainty, leading investors to anticipate a potential economic downturn. The unclear stance of the Federal Reserve regarding interest rate hikes and temporary pauses throughout 2023 has contributed to this sentiment.

Despite the drop in trading volumes, it appears that Bitcoin holders are holding onto their current investments. They are not seeking quick profits through short-term trading but view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as long-term investments. These investors are more interested in holding onto their crypto assets, believing in their future value rather than selling at the first sign of potential profit.

Recent data from the cryptocurrency analytics platform ""IntoTheBlock"" indicates that long-term Bitcoin holders continue to hold their assets despite market disruptions. Long-term holders are investors and companies that purchased their cryptocurrencies at least a year ago. They currently hold 13.44 million Bitcoin, representing 69% of the circulating supply in the crypto Bitcoin market.

From my perspective, the drop in trading volumes and the shift towards long-term holding come at a time when Bitcoin's price is stabilizing around $26,000. Short-term Bitcoin holders are currently holding onto their funds, incurring unrealized losses as the cost basis rises above the current spot price of Bitcoin.

As a result of these factors, interest in Bitcoin as a short- and medium-term investment has waned, evident in recent drops in US stock indices, particularly the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Interest in owning and investing in Bitcoin among new investors remains low amidst the current economic uncertainty and globally unstable market and economic conditions.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,8.089227,8e5f743b76ccb103035b1ee92c8f8d14

Guidance Reaffirmed. According to the semi-annual figures for 2023, the company reaffirms its guidance. Bitcoin Group's management projects a rise in registered users to 1,065,000 by the end of 2023, though it anticipates a marginal dip in revenue. Despite the present challenges posed by geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties, the board maintains a positive outlook on the future trajectory. The company's stringent security and transparency standards have fostered trust, aiding in customer base expansion. Furthermore, efforts are underway to establish a consistent EU-wide regulation to bolster growth. To optimize the potential of its burgeoning customer base, Bitcoin Group is strategizing enhancements in user experience and overall functionality. The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model, a metric evaluating Bitcoin's scarcity, points toward potential bullish price movements, especially with the anticipated Bitcoin halving event in 2024. A halving event sees the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks slashed by half, consequently limiting the daily influx of new Bitcoins. Historically, such events have often catalyzed Bitcoin price surges, as diminishing supply amidst stable or growing demand can elevate the cryptocurrency's value. On the flip side, the dissolved partnership with Fidor Bank might cast a shadow on the revenue prospects for 2023. Nevertheless, Bitcoin Group is actively pursuing a new express trading partner and has entered into promising negotiations to that end. For the fiscal year 2023, our revenue projections remain steadfast at €7.03 million, with an anticipated increase to €13.57 million in 2024. In May 2023, Bitcoin Group chose to discontinue its acquisition pursuits of 'Bankhaus von der Heydt', deeming it not beneficial for the company and its stakeholders. This decision brought about extra expenditures, which will be felt in the 2023 financial statements. Given the subdued revenue metrics, our forecast indicates a downturn in the EBITDA for 2023 to -€0.08 million. However, we predict a positive rebound in 2024 with an EBITDA estimate of €5.31 million. This EBITDA trend closely aligns with the anticipated net earnings. For 2023, we project a modest net gain of €0.20 million, with a more robust €3.37 million for 2024. While the company may contemplate selling a portion of its crypto assets to enhance the bottom line, such a move hasn't been factored into our forecasting model. Within our DCF valuation model, we determined a new price target of €55.00 (previously: €58.00). Our profit and loss forecasts remained unchanged. However, we assume that the net crypto holdings have decreased from about €100 million to approximately €85 million. Consequently, there was a slight reduction in the target price.

In particular, Coutts speaks about BlackRock, describing the asset manager's application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Bitcoin spot ETF as 'unsurprising.'

The analyst stated that BlackRock and other prominent global asset managers, namely Vanguard and State Street, have been involved in the Bitcoin mining industry for over three years.

In hindsight, #BlackRock's massive #Bitcoin spot ETF play shouldn't have been that surprising. Along with other behemoths (Vanguard, StateStreet) who espouse #ESG-driven investing principles, they started scooping up public mining stock back in 2020 ESG, Institutionalization🧵 pic.twitter.com/VcKX8TrgZ2 — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 26, 2023

BlackRock And Other ESG-Driven Companies Investing In Bitcoin Mining, Analyst Says

James Coutts stated that BlackRock began its venture into Bitcoin mining in 2020 by investing in Marathon Digital, the second-largest publicly traded mining company.

Notably, this development occurred when the Bitcoin mining industry faced high criticism, likely due to the substantial reliance on fossil fuels.

Over the last three years, Coutts reports that BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have increased their respective investments in Bitcoin mining companies, regardless of the market cycle.

Interestingly, all three asset managers are known to promote Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment principles, part of which is limiting fossil fuel use. However, it appears that investing in Bitcoin mining may not damage the ESG credentials of these companies.

According to a report by Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital, James Coutt notes that Bitcoin mining currently derives 50% of its energy from sustainable sources. And this percentage is likely to increase as Bitcoin mining has the unique ability to monetize stranded energy and stabilize energy grids.

Potential Effect Of Bitcoin Mining Institutionalization

Based on James Coutts's report, BlackRock and the two other asset managers in the discussion are currently the top investors in the three largest publicly traded mining companies, namely Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and Cleanspark.

Together, these mining companies collectively own 8.9% of the global hash rate, which is significant as public miners only account for 15% of the global hash power.

Source: Bloomberg Intelligence

For now, James Coutts believes that the involvement of these asset managers in Bitcoin mining poses little challenge to the network's decentralization.

However, the analyst notes that there may be a future clash of network and ESG values, especially given the activist tendencies of BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street.

However, this would not prevent the Bitcoin network from operating as expected. But it may lead other miners whose operations still rely on fossil fuels to start processing 'censored transactions.'

Among worldwide millionaires in the crypto space, a staggering 40,500 hold their fortunes in Bitcoin, according to BanklessTimes.

This number underscores the profound influence and adoption of the original cryptocurrency.

In the realm of centi-millionaires (those holding at least $100 million in cryptocurrencies), 78 individuals have achieved this remarkable status. Furthermore, six billionaires have crossed the billion-dollar threshold through their crypto holdings. These figures reflect the potential for astronomical gains in the crypto market.

TradingPlatform's crypto analyst Edith Reads commented on the data, ""To join the exclusive club of crypto millionaires and above, one must accumulate at least $1 million in digital assets. Astonishingly, a mere 1% of all crypto users worldwide meet this criteria. This statistic emphasizes the wealth gap within the crypto ecosystem, with most users holding considerably smaller portfolios.""

Additionally, it experienced a 1.49% drop in the last 24 hours, but in the past hour, it has risen by 0.13%, currently sitting at $26,143.90 per Bitcoin. These price fluctuations began as trading commenced on Monday, September 25, after the cryptocurrency platform Mixin Network announced that a group of hackers had targeted its cloud service provider, resulting in a loss of nearly $200 million in a significant cyberattack. The company stated that this incident forced it to temporarily suspend deposit and withdrawal operations.

The platform further explained that it would reopen the suspended services after identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities. It added that transactions would remain unaffected during the evaluation period. Mixin's CEO, Feng Xiaodong, will address the incident today at 05:00 GMT and the team will guide how users can recover their lost assets thereafter. It is worth noting that Mixin Network is a decentralized P2P exchange platform for cryptocurrency projects, supporting 48 currencies and holding assets valued at over $1 billion.

In response to this incident, Mixin's XIN token saw a sharp decline early in Monday's trading, losing approximately 10% and trading at $195. Bitcoin's prices also dropped by around 1.49% in the past few hours, reaching a low of $26,055.

Furthermore, the NFT platform OpenSea warned its users of a potential security breach with one of its suppliers. Platform officials explained that the incident might not have immediate effects on users, but it could expose customer API keys. OpenSea advised users to refresh their current keys and replace them immediately with newly generated options, confirming that the existing API keys would expire on October 2nd.

Therefore, I believe this news will have a significant negative impact on Bitcoin's price, which often leads to the prices of other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, I see regulatory measures tightening against digital currency platforms and companies reaching their peak after these events, ultimately causing a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices, possibly reaching $20,000. This downward pressure will also adversely affect other digital currency prices. I do not foresee any significant market recovery until the end of the current year unless positive actions or clear regulations for traded Bitcoin funds and digital asset sector security are implemented to ensure investor confidence.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,7.45991,03e96fe93d16945262d05a24c13d15c2

Bitcoin remains above $26,000 and is losing less than 2%, Ripple, Alogrand and Kyber are also trading under pressure, losing almost 8% today. Moonbeam, on the other hand, is doing very well, gaining almost 39% after the news of a possible listing on the Upbit exchange: the cryptocurrency's trading volume increased almost 20 times.



Several Glassnode indicators point to a resurgence of bearish sentiment (the price has fallen below the average purchase price of short-term investors who bought bitcoin over the last 155 days).

In their latest analysis, Glassnode analysts highlighted that the inflow of new investors into the cryptocurrency market this year was positive but very small. On-chain data shows that the number of bitcoins deposited on exchanges has increased in recent weeks, which may suggest a prolonged period of bitcoin weakness.

Bitcoin and Moonbeam (D1) Charts

Looking at the BITCOIN chart, we see that the price is trading below SMA100 and SMA200 and sellers may want to test the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement at $25,600, which has proven to be important support so far. Breaking this limit could indicate a test of $21,700 where the 61.8% Fibonacci runs. On the other hand, however, the MACD indicates a bullish divergence similar to that of Fall 2022 (yellow rectangle): key resistance remains around $28,000 (23.6% Fib of the November 2022 ascending wave).

MOONBEAM cryptocurrency price soared on hopes of the cryptocurrency being listed on major exchanges and the resulting surge in speculator interest, but the rallies quickly died out near the SMA200 (red line) and are now retreating into the area of around 0.22% set by the SMA100 and previous price reactions. If the bulls fail to break above the SMA200 again, the base case is a new downtrend. The RSI indicator points to levels close to overbought at 76 points.

Next, we see that the percentage of short-term addresses in profit has again recorded a massive drop to levels not seen in 11 months (over 97.5% of addresses are posting losses). This may mean that the pressure to sell BTC at a loss in the STH pool (short-term holders) may be growing, as evidenced by the previous pattern of on-chain behavior (when the price fell below the average STH purchase price of BTC).

Source: Glassnode

If we look historically, with the exception of a few cases where a situation similar to the current one, a price drop below the STH average has sometimes been a ""contrary"" signal; indicating an oversold market - a potential accumulation opportunity for long-term investors.

Source: Glassnode

The new investor confidence index (calculated by Glassnode by subtracting from the average BTC purchase price of long-term addresses (LTH), the average purchase price of investors selling Bitcoin, and dividing by the current market price) fell again to negative levels for the first time since January 2023.

Cryptocurrency market data provider Kaiko research analyst Dessislava Ianeva pointed out that the recorded fall is the second-largest monthly decline since April.

""BTC trade volumes on Binance are down 48 per cent in Sept, the second-largest monthly decline since April. Both drops coincided with the removal of zero fees for the largest BTC trading pairs. However, this time, the decline seems to align more closely with the broad market,"" Ianeva posted on X on Friday.

Users left the exchange in April after it cancelled the trading incentives associated with its Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin due to regulatory issues.

The exchange's trading volume had dropped by nearly 70 per cent during the second quarter at the time.

A similar situation occurred earlier this month when the exchange discontinued the zero-trading-fee incentives for its TrueUSD (TUSD) and BTC trading pairs, causing traders to migrate to other platforms.

While the removal of free trading incentives contributed to Binance's declining volume, the exchange has also faced increased regulatory issues in various jurisdictions, including the US and Europe, which has harmed its overall market share.

US regulators sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao in June this year for allegedly operating a ""web of deception"" and filed 13 charges in a federal court.

Binance was also ordered by Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) to immediately cease all offers of virtual currency services in the country.

Several crypto companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in recent months like Genesis Global Trading (a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), FTX, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager.

crypto markets, the Company was able to generate 162.71 bitcoins - without raising any additional capital.

""In addition, the management has identified the following sectors of interest: fintech with focus on liquidity and AI/VR smart glasses/headsets.

This steady accumulation could pave the way for some action as the new week unfolds.

Significant changes are also becoming evident in the overall composition of Bitcoin investors.

This decrease in short-term speculators suggests a growing cohort of strong Bitcoin holders, indicating resilience in the face of market volatility.

duke explains that after a period of remarkably low volatility, bitcoin faced a sharp sell-off last week, dropping from around $30,000 to $25,000 due to concerns about china's economic health and signals from the us federal reserve regarding high interest rates. he highlights an intriguing correlation between bitcoin and traditional markets, which had been at odds with the previously observed divergence.

he also notes the ""hodler"" phenomenon, with a significant percentage of bitcoin holders refraining from trading their holdings, even during peak price periods. he says ""the bitcoin investors we see as quite an unusual animal... there seems to be this mindset of buy and hold with bitcoin as a long-term safe-haven asset.""

duke expresses long-term bullish sentiment for both bitcoin and ethereum, emphasising the potential of both cryptocurrencies, though he acknowledged the inherent unpredictability of price movements in crypto markets.

He added: 'If you got your bitcoin, I wouldn't sell your bitcoin, you made it through winter.'


Scaramucci Remains Bullish on Bitcoin


Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci explained why he remains optimistic about the future of bitcoin during a fireside chat, titled 'Why I'm still bullish,' at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York on Thursday.


Nothing that he believes the worst of the bitcoin bear market is over, he advised:




If you got your bitcoin, I wouldn't sell your bitcoin, you made it through winter … The next 10 to 20 years are remarkably bullish.




He believes that young people 'will be mainstreaming bitcoin' in the same way his generation 'mainstreamed the internet.'


The Skybridge Capital founder cautioned that headwinds are still in the macro environment, including higher interest rates, an enforcement-centric Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, and negative sentiment around crypto adoption. Nonetheless, he remains optimistic about 
BTC
, stating: 'As wealth is created in society, a portion of that wealth is going to get chipped off for digital assets, most likely bitcoin.' He also reiterated his long-standing view that 'Bitcoin is better than gold.'


Scaramucci further expects the approval of bitcoin exchange-trading funds (ETFs) to be a game changer. He anticipates massive and widespread adoption of 
BTC
 once bitcoin ETFs become commonplace. The Skybridge Capital founder opined:




Every single Wall Street firm is going to have a bitcoin ETF in their arsenal … When Wall Street has something in their arsenal, they sell it to their clients … The market [for bitcoin] is going to widen.

Important for BTC/","(MENAFN- DailyFX) Bitcoin, BTC/USD, Ethereum, ETH/USD - Price Action:



Bitcoin and Ethereum have cleared above minor resistance.

Important for BTC/USD and ETH/USD to sustain gains if the rebound is for real. What is the outlook and what are the key levels to watch?

BITCOIN: Takes on vital resistance

Bitcoin's rise to a minor resistance at the mid-September high of 27500 raises the odds that the two-month-long decline could be over. This follows a hold above strong support at the June low of 24750, which has kept intact the higher-top-higher-bottom formation since the end of 2022. Importantly, this keeps alive the possibility of a further recovery given the sharp 2021-2022 decline.

BTC/USD is now testing a key ceiling at the end-August high of 28150, coinciding with the 200-day moving average. A decisive break above could clear the path toward the July high of 31800, which could be a defining moment for Bitcoin. Any break above would not only trigger a double bottom but would reinforce the bullish medium-term trajectory, first highlighted earlier this year – see'Bitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC/USD Turns Bullish', published January 18.

Chart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView

The potential price objective of the double bottom pattern (the June and the September lows) works out to around 39000. Such a move would imply a break above the 89-week moving average and a cross above the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts – for the first time since 2022. For the bullish view to unfold, BTC/USD needs to stay above the June low of 24750.

ETHEREUM: Beginning to flex muscles

Ethereum's break above the mid-September high of 1670 appears to have reduced immediate downside risks. This follows a hold above a crucial floor at the August low of 1535, not too far from the lower edge of a declining channel since early 2023.

ETH/USD Daily Chart

Chart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView

ETH/USD is now testing a fairly strong resistance area. This includes the end-August high of 1745, the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, and the 200-day moving average. Ethereum needs to break above 1745-1805 for the medium-term recovery trajectory to play out. So far, ETH/USD has been holding above significant long-term support on the 200-week moving average – despite the weakness since 2021, ETH/USD hasn't decisively fallen below the average.

If this morning's rebound is indeed a turning point for cryptocurrencies, ETH/USD needs to hold above the stiff support at 1450-1550.

In the world of investing, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have established themselves as a popular an","In the world of investing, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have established themselves as a popular and cost-effective way for individuals to diversify their portfolios. Rather than purchasing individual securities, investors can buy a single ETF that represents a wide range of assets, providing exposure to a diverse array of industries, sectors, and asset classes.

Lately, the SEC delayed the decision to approve or deny any Bitcoin Spot ETF again. Another delay or decision can be expected in October 2023.

A Bitcoin Spot ETF, if approved, could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency market. It would allow institutional investors, who are typically more risk-averse, to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without actually holding the asset. This could potentially lead to billions of dollars flowing into the market, significantly boosting the liquidity and stability of Bitcoin and its forks, like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Spark.

The potential impact of a Bitcoin Spot ETF cannot be overstated. Currently, institutional investors who wish to invest in Bitcoin must navigate the often complex and unfamiliar world of cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and private keys. A Bitcoin Spot ETF would simplify this process, making Bitcoin as straightforward to invest in as any traditional asset.

Moreover, the introduction of a Bitcoin Spot ETF would also likely lead to greater regulatory oversight and legitimacy for the cryptocurrency market. It could attract a new wave of institutional and retail investors, further fuelling the demand for Bitcoin and its forks.

Among the variforks of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Spark stands out for its potential. Bitcoin Spark is in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) phase.

Bitcoin Spark aims to harness the power and security of the Bitcoin network while also addressing some of the perceived shortcomings of Bitcoin, such as its scalability issues and energy consumption. If successful, Bitcoin Spark could become a significant blockchain and potentially the most-used BTC fork of all.

Investors are especially intrigued by the high accessibility the smartphone mining of BTCS offers while having the same decentralized benefits of Bitcoin and the speed and scalability of the Ethereum network. This is possible due to its hybrid approach that combines the best of PoW and PoS into the new brand-new consenmechanism PoP (Proof-of-Process).

In conclusion, the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF could have far-reaching implications for Bitcoin and its forks, including Bitcoin Spark and Bitcoin Cash. This could potentially result in an impressive surge of funds into the digital currency sector, bolstering its steadiness and fluidity while drawing in a fresh cohort of investors.

TORONTO and BROSSARD, Québec, Oct. 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (
NASDAQ: BITF//TSX: BITF
), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company, provides a Bitcoin (BTC) production and mining operations update for September 2023.
 
'In September, we continued to install new miners and fully energized Rio Cuarto to 51 MW, increasing our operating capacity by 9% to 233 MW. Year-to-date, we increased operating capacity by 24% and upgraded and expanded our fleet with over 15,000 additional miners,' said Geoff Morphy, CEO of Bitfarms. 'Also in September, our hashrate increased 9% to 6.1 EH/s, slightly below our Q3 2023 target of 6.3 EH/s reflecting some electrical infrastructure delays that pushed out the Baie-Comeau, Québec facility's full installation by a couple of weeks.'
 
'We continue to believe that many of our best opportunities for growth and investment will arise around the next Bitcoin halving expected to occur in April 2024. To this end, we are focused on infrastructure and balance sheet strength to provide the financial flexibility to move aggressively when conditions for growth are optimal. We continued to pay down debt, closing September with under $10 million of outstanding indebtedness, all of which is scheduled for repayment in advance of the halving,' added Morphy.
 
Ben Gagnon, Chief Mining Officer of Bitfarms, said, 'As the farm in Argentina became fully energized, our BTC production was 411 in September, up 7.3% from August 2023 even with a 2.7% network difficulty increase in the month.'
 
'Executing on our comprehensive fleet management strategy, we have further optimized our miner portfolio while bolstering our balance sheet in anticipation of purchasing the next generation of sub-20 w/TH miners after the halving. The September installation of S19 Pro + miners in Argentina nearly doubled the number of sub-30 w/TH miners in operation and shifted the fleet portfolio constitution; it is now comprised of 23% sub-30 w/TH miners, 58% 30-40 w/TH machines and 19% 40-45 w/TH machines. As expected, we are now well positioned to leapfrog over the XP generation entirely and strategically layer in the new sub-20 w/TH miners for both upgrades and expansion. The recently announced new generation of sub-20 w/TH miners have the capability to rapidly drive hashrate growth and increase energy efficiency around halving at significantly lower costs per TH than XP miners have traded for throughout 2023,' concluded Gagnon.
 
Mining Review 
 
Due to the added corporate capacity supplemented by the moderate weather in North America that minimized curtailment and facilitated uptimes, September production of 411 BTC rose 7.3% from the 383 BTC mined in August, which included an extra day of production.
 
Network difficulty increased 2.7% in September compared to August, as Bitcoin miners anticipating higher Bitcoin prices continue to invest in capacity and come online. For the nine months ended September 30
th
, network difficulty increased 61.5% while the BTC price was up roughly 63.2%, resulting in a 3.6% improvement in mining economics as measured by USD/TH/day.

Bitcoin, stocks, and American bonds retreated sharply in the overnight session as risks continued growing. The BTC/USD pair retreated to a low of 27,185, lower than this week's high of 28,558. It remains almost 10% above the lowest level in September.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies came under pressure as bets of higher rates continued after the strong US vacancies data. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the JOLTs job openings jumped to more than 9.16 million in August, higher than the median estimate of 8.8 million.

The data came ahead of the upcoming ADP private sector jobs data by ADP. Economists polled by Reuters expect the data to show that the economy created over 160k jobs in September after adding 177k in the previous month.

The BLS will next publish the latest non-farm payrolls (NFP) data on Friday. These numbers will provide more information on what to expect from the Federal Reserve in the coming months.

Some Fed officials have pointed to the need for more rate hikes or leaving rates at the current level for a while. They cite the fact that inflation remains at an elevated level. The most recent data showed that the headline consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 3.7% in August. In a statement, Fed's Loretta Mester said:

'At this point, I suspect we may well need to raise the fed funds rate once more this year and then hold it there for some time as we accumulate more information on economic developments.'

Bitcoin also retreated as the bond sell-off intensified. The 10-year yield jumped to 4.7% while the 30-year soared to 3.80%. Similarly, American stocks also plunged, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 falling by more than 500 and 200 points, respectively/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has retreated in the past two straight days. On the daily chart, the pair remains slightly above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. It has also formed a double-bottom pattern at 24,979 and an inverted head and shoulders. In price action analysis, these are some of the most bullish signs.

Therefore, the pair will likely remain in this range on Wednesday, with the key support and resistance to watch being 26,500 and 28,700. A move above this week's high of 28,700 will point to more upside to 30,000.

The BTC/USD pair surged to a high of 28,617 on Monday, the highest level since August 17th. It then pulled back during the American session as stocks and bonds continued their relentless sell-off. Bitcoin retreated to a low of 27,697 recovery loses momentum

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies started the quarter well as demand continued rising. At its peak, the coin was up by more than 14% from its lowest level this year. As a result, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies soared to over $1.1 trillion.

They then pulled back as risks to the American and global economy continued. The 10-year and 30-year bond yields rose to the highest level in more than a decade. Bond yields and prices move in the opposite direction.

US equities also resumed the bearish trend. The Dow Jones dropped by more than 230 points while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices slipped by 25 and 25 points, respectively. The US dollar index (DXY), on the other hand, soared by more than 76 basis points to $106.62.

Bitcoin has done well in the past few weeks as investors predict that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the spot Bitcoin ETF. Several companies like Blackrock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton have filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC.

The odds are in their favor, especially after the agency lost a major lawsuit against Grayscale, which runs the biggest trust in the industry. A Bitcoin ETF will likely lead to more Bitcoin inflows, pushing the price higher/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has done relatively well after bottoming below 25,000 in September. It jumped to a high of 28,593 on Monday and then resumed the bearish trend. Bitcoin has formed an inverted head and shoulders pattern whose neckline was at 27,522 (September 19th September.

This week's high of 28,593 was an important level since it was the lowest swing on August 1st. Further, the pair rose above the 25-period and 50-period moving averages. Most importantly, it has formed a break and retest pattern, which is a sign of a bullish continuation.

Therefore, the pair will likely continue rising as buyers attempt to retest this week's high of 28,500.

Presented at Cosmoverse, the Cosmos Network's premier conference, by Nomic's founders and core-contributors, Turbofish, Nomic will be upgraded to enable seamless BTC deposits and withdrawals throughout the entire Cosmos Network, from any platform or chain in the ecosystem.

At present, there is a lack of decentralized and streamlined methods available to users for bringing BTC into the Cosmos Network. To address this, Nomic instead empowers users to bring their BTC into Cosmos with nBTC, an IBC-compatible token, which saves users from having to convert their BTC into a different cryptocurrency.

Nomic Brings Bitcoin to the Entire Cosmos Ecosystem

Tweet this

During today's keynote, Turbofish CEO Matt Bell unveiled Nomic's nBTC Interchain Upgrade, scheduled for release on October 27, 2023 and activation on October 30, 2023, which will unlock a truly seamless and interoperable Bitcoin experience in Cosmos. The upgrade will do so by enabling users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer BTC from anywhere in the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, as demonstrated on stage, nBTC is launching on Osmosis, the premier decentralized exchange of Cosmos, with the ability to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin directly within the Osmosis Zone app.

""I believe the destiny of Cosmos is to become the application layer of Bitcoin; in fact it was that vision that drew me to the ecosystem many years ago in the first place. However, getting BTC off the Bitcoin chain in a secure and decentralized way remained a challenge -- until now. With Nomic, users will be able to use native Bitcoin on Osmosis and throughout the Cosmos ecosystem,"" said Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis . ""Bitcoin is in deep need of an application DeFi ecosystem, and Cosmos is in need of a base money asset that can serve as its primary store of value. Nomic will help make this long-awaited union for a Bitcoin-centric Cosmos a reality.""

In addition to Osmosis, from day one users can deposit and withdraw BTC directly in other popular Cosmos applications like Kujira and Levana.

To ensure BTC security, Nomic is currently undergoing an auditing process that will test the integrity of the bridge. Following the publishing of the audits, an update will transfer bridge capacity and fee controls to the Nomic DAO, which will control any BTC capacity limits along with deposit and transfer fees and result in expansion of bridge utilization. These upgrades represent a significant step toward advancing the functionality and accessibility of the Nomic platform.

""The Cosmos ecosystem is too important for it to lack a seamless and secure way to receive BTC. With these forthcoming upgrades, Nomic is poised to be the most secure bitcoin bridge on the market today,"" said Matt Bell, CEO of Turbofish, who spoke at Cosmoverse today to introduce the upgrades. ""We see today's announcement as the beginning of the most seamless and secure way to on-ramp users into the Cosmos ecosystem with BTC. With these upgrades, we are thrilled that Nomic will now unlock the exciting DeFi capabilities of the Cosmos ecosystem for any user holding BTC.""

With Nomic, rather than merely holding BTC in wallets without active utilization, users can participate in various markets and DeFi products, such as liquidity provisioning (LPing). This approach is designed to maximize the potential benefits of BTC within the Cosmos network, fostering growth and sustainability for both the platform and its users.

Cosmos, known for its scalability and security since its 2019 launch, features the IBC Protocol for token transfers between different blockchains. Until now, a secure method for transferring BTC into Cosmos was lacking - a gap now addressed by Nomic.

408,Will Bitcoin Spark's Rise Lure Ethereum Miners In?,MENAFN,2023-10-01 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107170701/Will-Bitcoin-Sparks-Rise-Lure-Ethereum-Miners-In,menafn.com,--News Direct-- Introduction to Cryptocurrency Mining Cryptocurrency mining has captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and inv,"Cryptocurrency mining has captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and investors around the world. It is the process by which new digital currencies are created, and transactions are verified on a decentralized network. The two most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, rely on mining to secure their respective blockchains. Mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles using powerful computers, requiring significant computational power and energy consumption.

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading cryptocurrencies, differ in variaspects, including their mining algorithms and goals. Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consenalgorithm, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In contrast, Ethereum is moving towards a Proof of Stake (PoS) consenalgorithm, which will eliminate the need for traditional mining. Instead, Ethereum miners will need to hold and lock up a certain amount of Ethereum in a wallet to participate in the validation process.

Bitcoin Spark, a new and promising cryptocurrency, has recently gained significant attention in the crypto community. It aims to address some of the scalability and energy consumption issues associated with Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin Spark utilizes an innovative consenalgorithm that combines the security of Proof of Work with the efficiency of Proof of Stake. This hybrid approach can potentially revolutionize the mining industry and attract miners from other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.

Some say the rise of Bitcoin Spark could significantly impact Ethereum miners in the coming years. The hybrid consenalgorithm used by Bitcoin Spark offers several advantages over traditional mining methods. Firstly, Bitcoin requires significantly less computational power and energy consumption than Bitcoin mining. This makes it more accessible and cost-effective for individual miners and reduces the environmental impact of mining operations. Secondly, the innovative approach taken by Bitcoin Spark could lead to faster transaction processing and increased scalability, which are critical factors for the success of any cryptocurrency.

Moreover, Ethereum miners may be enticed by the potential rewards and incentives Bitcoin Spark offers. As the popularity and adoption of Bitcoin Spark grow, its value is expected to increase. Miners who switch from Ethereum to Bitcoin Spark would benefit from the potential appreciation of the new cryptocurrency, tmaximizing their profits. Additionally, Bitcoin Spark's hybrid consenalgorithm could provide more opportunities for miners to participate and earn rewards, as the staking component allows for passive income generation.

For those interested in diving deeper into cryptocurrency mining, several resources are available to expand their knowledge. Online forums such as Reddit and Bitcointalk provide platforms for discussions and sharing of experiences among miners. Websites like Benzinga offer comprehensive news coverage and analysis of the latest trends and developments in the cryptocurrency industry. Additionally, varionline courses and tutorials provide step-by-step guidance on how to mine different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The rise of Bitcoin Spark and its innovative hybrid consenalgorithm has the potential to reshape the cryptocurrency mining landscape. Some believe Ethereum miners may be lured by the advantages offered by Bitcoin Spark, including lower energy consumption, increased scalability, and potential rewards. Miners and investors need to stay informed about the latest advancements in the industry and explore new opportunities that emerge. With the rapid evolution of cryptocurrencies, understanding the differences between mining methods and staying up to date with the latest trends will be crucial for success in this ever-changing field.

While more than $268 million,"The crypto market is on edge as FTX is expected to liquidate some of its assets this Wednesday. While more than $268 million worth of Bitcoin may get sold off alongside altcoins, the on-chain metrics for BTC are stronger than ever.

This article will discuss whether BTC can hold up better than other altcoins. We also discuss the arrival of a new Bitcoin-themed presale token, Bitcoin BSC , which could also be a high potential investment opportunity.

In November 2022, FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, declared bankruptcy. More than ten months later, the infamcrypto exchange is set to begin liquidating its crypto holdings.

According to trader Fomocap on Twitter, the market may see a 'fire sale' following the selling pressure this week. FTX exchange will likely get approval for the liquidation of assets starting September 13, 2023.

From the $3.4 billion worth of assets that FTX holds, $200 million will likely be sold off every week. One of the largest holdings of FTX is Bitcoin - the company holds $268 million worth of BTC, with even an larger position in Solana (SOL) valued at $685 million.

Despite the selling pressure from FTX, Bitcoin is unlikely to be affected in the long term. For more than 15 years, Bitcoin has been in an uptrend, and by far the most dominant cryptocurrency in the space.

According to coin360, Bitcoin has a 47.86% dominance as of September 11, 2023. In the past 24 hours, BTC has corrected by only 0.25%. On the other hand, altcoins such as Ethereum and Binance Coin have dipped by closer to 1%. Solana is down 2% today, and dropped 6% yesterday.

Data from Crypto Cacon Substack also states that Bitcoin's dominance among institutional investors has remained strong in the medium term. Since January 2023, there has been an increase in the BTC wallets holding $100k or more. Wallets holding $10k or more have also increased, which is a positive sign for the flagship cryptocurrency.

Another impressive factor for Bitcoin is the rise in the number of HODLers. Year-on-Year (YoY), the Bitcoin wallet holding percentage is up by 7.7%. This suggests growing confidence among investors in the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization.

Institutional investors such as Pantera Capital have also recently made headlines for their optimistic Bitcoin price prediction - as high as $148,000 in the next crypto bull run.

Based on its strong on-chain metrics, it's unclear how badly Bitcoin will be affected by the FTX liquidation process. New cryptocurrency assets without ties to FTX may also be seen as a safe haven asset class to buy the dip.

Cryptocurrency analysts and price prediction algorithms expect Bitcoin to be bullish in the coming years.

Changelly's price prediction algorithm predicts BTC could reach a maximum price of $37k by the end of 2023. Since BTC is currently trading at the $25,770 mark, this will equate to a price increase of more than 43% by the end of the year.

Crypto analyst Jacob Bury reviewed the Bitcoin Rainbow chart in a recent Bitcoin price prediction video, noting that BTC is currently in the buy zone.

Kara Szabo is another popular cryptocurrency influencer who is bullish on the BTC price. This Twitter influencer, who has nearly 40K followers, expects the token to range in the $30k - $40k zone by the end of 2023.

While Bitcoin is still a strong asset to hold, there have been new tokens that have also been offering high returns to investors.

One such new crypto token currently trending online is Bitcoin BSC, recently featured on Bitcoinist, Cointelegraph, CoinCodex, CoinMarketCap, FXStreet and a wide range of other news sites.

Bitcoin BSC is a new cryptocurrency currently available to buy on presale. As the name suggests, the project takes inspiration from Bitcoin but is a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain.

Bitcoin BSC's native token, $BTCBSC, has a total supply of 21 million, like Bitcoin, and will also follow Bitcoin's 120-year block schedule.

The key difference is that Bitcoin BSC introduces a staking mechanism for passive income and has a greener, more sustainable network model. Every ten minutes, tokens are released and distributed to stakers. At the time of writing, holders can earn an over 400% APY (annual percentage yield) by staking $BTCBSC.

From the 21 million token supply, 6.125 million have been allotted for the ongoing presale, each priced at just under $1 - modelled after Bitcoin's circulating supply and price in 2011.

With its high APY, the Bitcoin BSC project has already attracted the attention of traders wanting to farm yield during the bear market. Since launching its presale on September 5th, over $1 million has already been raised.

The project's hard cap is set at $6.125 million. Interested investors can buy and stake $BTCBSC now at bitcoinbsc.io if they purchase tokens using BNB or USDT BEP-20. Tokens bought with ETH or USDT ERC-20 are eligible to be staked after the presale concludes.

Read the Bitcoin BSC whitepaper and follow the official Twitter for updates on the project's progress.

Switzerland is well placed to take a leading role, having established a network of cryptocurrency companies, collectively known as'Crypto Valley', which interact with the traditional financial sector.

Swiss bankers are enthused by way digital blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) could automate time-consuming tasks, such as processing transactions, and open new avenues of business.

'Blockchain is going to fundamentally change our business, everyone is looking into it,' Grégoire Bordier, president of the Association of Swiss Private Banks, told SWI swissinfo.

'A fundamental competitive pillar of the financial industry is IT. One of the reasons that Switzerland welcomed the creation of Crypto Valley was to remain in the game during the constant evolution of IT innovation.'

The goal is to speed up financial transactions, reduce fees and automate different parts of the financial chain. But what does this mean for banks, traders and the person on the street? It ultimately depends on the exact design of the new digital money.

The creators of bitcoin invented blockchain to give users total control over their money and the freedom to spend it without needing a bank – much like handing someone physical cash, but in the digital world.

A separate breed of cryptocurrency, called stablecoins, seeks to curb wild price swings by pegging to traditional currencies or other assets to stabilise their value (see animation).",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/03/S_8df85image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.897191,75bee6485081d37e59d0e72f65fd82b8

HOUSTON, Oct. 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (' Digihost ' or the' Company ') (Nasdaq: DGHI; TSXV: DGHI), an innovative U.S. based blockchain technology and computer infrastructure company, is pleased to provide unaudited comparative Bitcoin (' BTC ') production results for the month ended September 30, 2023, combined with an operations update. All monetary references are expressed in USD unless otherwise indicated.

Monthly Production Highlights for September 2023



Mined approximately 85 BTC. Production of daily BTC mined increased by 21% over the previous month, as the Company finalized the infrastructure setup at its most recently acquired site. Infrastructure installation has been completed at the Company's other two sites.



The Company held cash, BTC and cash deposits of approximately $2.4 million as of September 30, 2023 (based on a BTC price of $26,968 as of September 30, 2023 per CoinMarketCap), which was approximately 10% greater than Digihost's cash, BTC and cash deposits of $2.2 million as of August 31, 2023 (based on a BTC price of $25,930 as of August 31, 2023 per CoinMarketCap).



Spent approximately $0.3 million on capital expenditure and mining infrastructure support equipment. Digihost continues to monitor its capital expenditures closely with self-funding to avoid equity dilution for its shareholders.



Consistent with management's ongoing commitment to avoid equity dilution for its shareholders, the Company has continued to monetize a portion of its BTC production to fully fund its energy costs.

The Company did not purchase or sell any miners during the month.



Operations Update

As a result of the Company's site acquisition in Q1 2023, Digihost's consolidated operating capacity across its three sites has increased to approximately 100MW, representing approximately 2 EH of computing power.

The Company anticipates that its total capacity will be fully deployed by the end of 2023. The plant will continue flexible operations to ensure that 24/7 dispatchable electrical supply is made available to upstate New York area residents, businesses and industry to mitigate impacts of power interruptions.

Recognized as a principal manager of digital currency assets, Grayscale's track record lies in offering safe entry and varied involvement to the asset class encompassing digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Their ground-breaking initiative is exemplified by Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, which is the inaugural publicly traded securities exclusively invested in and gaining value from Bitcoin.

However, Grayscale has not been without its share of challenges. The company's innovative approach to digital currency has sometimes put them at odds with regulatory bodies, leading to legal disputes. One such dispute, a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been the foof recent attention in the cryptocurrency community. The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for Bitcoin and other digital currencies.

The legal action taken by Grayscale against the SEC is a groundbreaking matter and will pave the way for the future of cryptocurrencies. The litigation puts into question the SEC's power to oversee digital currencies the way it has in the past. The result of this court case could establish a model for how cryptocurrencies are dealt with by oversight agencies moving forward.

Grayscale's lawsuit is centered on the SEC's decision to deny a Bitcoin Spot ETF while approving Future ETFs. It highlights and questions the SEC's decision-making under Gary Gensler as chair.

As the court ruled in favor of Grayscale, not only the price of Bitcoin and all other altcoins jumped by up to 20%, also the of Bitcoin Spark saw an influx of investors rushing to buy the newest Bitcoin alternative.

The Grayscale lawsuit's positive outcome already had a significant impact on Bitcoin Spark's success since the ruling, with the majority of its investors rushing to buy more BTCS since.

The win for Grayscale bolsters the legitimacy of digital currencies and provides a significant endorsement of the legitimacy of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This will help to dispel some of the skepticism that surrounds cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased acceptance and adoption of digital currencies like Bitcoin Spark (BTCS).

As Phase 4 of the Bitcoin Spark starts to ramp up, the previphase saw a huge rush of buyers since the court win of Grayscale against the SEC. The highly sought-after is expected to sell out fairly quickly, especially with the innovative hybrid consenmechanism Proof-of-Process and the ability to mine BTCS with just a smartphone.

The Grayscale lawsuit win against the SEC is a landmark event in the world of cryptocurrency. It will have far-reaching implications for Bitcoin Spark and other digital currencies. This court ruling will pave the way for more widespread adoption of digital currencies, bolster the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, and drive up the value of Bitcoin Spark.

418,Blackrock ETF Delay Could Bring Liquidity To Bitcoin Spark,MENAFN,2023-10-04 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107184882/Blackrock-ETF-Delay-Could-Bring-Liquidity-To-Bitcoin-Spark,menafn.com,"--News Direct--The financial world is a vast, interconnected ecosystem where actions taken by one entity can have far-reaching implications","The financial world is a vast, interconnected ecosystem where actions taken by one entity can have far-reaching implications for others. In particular, the recent announcement by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the postponement of global asset manager BlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application could lead to a surprising outcome. It could inadvertently boost the liquidity of a new cryptocurrency on the block: Bitcoin Spark.

BlackRock, a financial powerhouse managing over $8.5 trillion in assets, recently saw its application for a Bitcoin ETF put on hold by the SEC. The decision came in the wake of the firm's proposal for a BTC-backed ETF, with Coinbase slated to be the custodian of the fund's Bitcoin holdings and the Bank of New York Mellon overseeing its fiat accounts.

The overarching aim of BlackRock's proposal was to eliminate the hurdles posed by the complexities and operational demands inherent in direct Bitcoin investment. The firm posited that the value of the shares in the ETF would circumvent these issues. However, the SEC's decision to delay comes hot on the heels of cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments' victory in overturning an SEC decision that had previously denied the listing of its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) on August 29.

The consenin the crypto-sphere is that the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF backed by BlackRock, the world's leading asset manager, would be a positive omen for cryptocurrency adoption. The delay, which gives the SEC an additional 45 days following publication in the Federal Register to approve, reject, or further postpone the BlackRock application, sets the next deadline for October 17.

To grasp the implications of the BlackRock ETF delay and its potential impact on Bitcoin Spark, it is crucial to understand the concept of Bitcoin mining. This process, central to the cryptocurrency realm, involves adding new Bitcoins to the circulating supply and confirming transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain network.

Bitcoin mining revolves around solving complex mathematical problems called proof-of-work (PoW). Miners vie against each other to solve these problems using computational power, with the first to succeed adding the subsequent block onto the blockchain and earning a set number of bitcoins as their reward.

Bitcoin mining works through a decentralized system that serves two primary purposes: It verifies transactions in a trustworthy manner when there are enough computational resources dedicated to processing the block, and it generates new bitcoins in each block, akin to a self-sustaining system.

The profitability of crypto mining is a multifaceted question. Several factors play a role in determining whether mining is a financially viable endeavor, with electricity costs being a significant determinant due to the high power consumption involved in cryptocurrency mining.

In regions where electricity is expensive, mining may not be profitable. The costs of mining hardware and the current market rate of mined cryptocurrencies also play a crucial role in determining the profitability of mining. When more miners participate in the network, it invariably escalates its difficulty level. This means that a miner must use more computational power to solve the mathematical problem and earn the block reward.

If the difficulty increases to the point where it's more expensive to mine than the rewards earned, mining becomes unprofitable. This is where Bitcoin Spark becomes interesting for most miners.

Bitcoin Spark steps onto the cryptocurrency stage as the easiest crypto to mine, distinguishing itself from other cryptocurrencies in several ways. For starters, Bitcoin Spark can be mined using a smartphone, making it accessible to a larger population. The mining process is designed to be less power-intensive, which can significantly reduce electricity costs, making it potentially profitable even for individuals who do not have access to expensive mining hardware or cheap electricity.

Furthermore, the process of mining Bitcoin Spark is less complex than traditional Bitcoin mining. It relies on a proof-of-process (PoP) consenmechanism, which combines proof-of-work and proof-of-stake methods. This means that while some computational power is needed, users also have the chance to earn more Bitcoin Spark-based algorithmic rewards.

Bitcoin Spark, the newcomer in the crypto world, has carved a niche for itself with its unique features and growth potential. It aims to tackle some of the limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies, such as scalability and transaction speed, operating on a blockchain network similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

However, Bitcoin Spark sets itself apart by implementing a unique consenmechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS). This mechanism allows users to participate in the network's decision-making process by holding and staking their Bitcoin Spark tokens.

The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and constant innovation. In recent months, several noteworthy developments have caught the attention of investors and traders alike. One such development is the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. Major players in the industry, including banks and payment processors, have started to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their services.

The acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance have further fueled the growth and legitimacy of the industry. This development, coupled with the SEC's delay in approving BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, could inadvertently steer investors toward new projects, especially those in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, like Bitcoin Spark.

As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continually makes headlines with its market movements and developments. In recent news, Bitcoin has experienced a surge in value, reaching all-time yearly highs. Factors such as increased institutional adoption, growing interest from retail investors, and the limited supply of Bitcoin have been attributed to this rally.

Experts in the cryptocurrency realm have been closely monitoring the rise of Bitcoin Spark and its potential impact on the industry. Many believe Bitcoin Spark's unique consenmechanism and scalability solutions position it as a strong contender in the cryptocurrency space.

In conclusion, Bitcoin Spark has emerged as a promising cryptocurrency, offering innovative solutions to some of the challenges traditional cryptocurrencies face. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, staying informed about the latest news and developments is crucial for anyone interested in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Spark and other cryptocurrencies present exciting opportunities for financial growth and freedom.

Bitcoin headed below the $27,500 level, and Ethereum also failed to consolidate above the $1,640 level as well.

While there does not seem to be much to move the cryptocurrency market so far this week other than more concerns about the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for a final time by 25 basis points this year, with the job openings (JOLTs) numbers for the month of August, which apparently exceeded expectations, singling more robust labor market. While these numbers contributed to strengthening ten-year bond yields, which rose to new record highs that we have not seen since 2007.

On the positive side, the court denied the SEC's request to appeal an earlier ruling, which was a partial victory for Ripple Labs, that its XRP token sales to retail investors were not registered securities. While the court said that the authority was unable to assess sufficient justifications for the appeal.

This court decision added more positive sentiment to Ripple investors at the time and pushed the XRP price to record gains of more than 7% with the announcement.

In a related context, Ripple Labs has obtained a full license to conduct payment settlement work using its crypto network in Singapore. While the company's CEO said that Singapore is striking the balance between innovation, consumer protection and sustainable growth, he added that Singapore is a leading hub of financial technology and digital assets.

The new license for Ripple Labs to operate in Singapore may enhance the adoption of cryptocurrency technology, especially among institutional investors, which the company particularly aspires to enhance as it seeks to be a global network in settling international payments.

However, the sustainability of the judicial conflict between law enforcement authorities on the one hand and companies operating in the sector on the other hand may delay and hinder this widespread adoption, especially in the United States, as regulatory concerns may weaken the confidence of those dealing in the sector until the features of the regulatory and legislative environment become clear.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,7.552846,d0214cae1624b4a1d4d60774486a430f

This pattern played out last week as both tokens went bearish. Right now, investors say the best crypto to buy is Domini.art ($DOMI) . This new platform will deliver huge returns to investors. Let's see why investors are dropping Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) for Domini.art ($DOMI) in 2023.

Recently, Dogecoin ($DOGE) co-founder Billy Mar took a swipe at a group that believes BTC is superior to the best altcoins. The Dogecoin ($DOGE) founder said BTC maximalists are the ''literal worst at marketing.''' He joked that the group invitation sounds like, ''Join our clearly mentally ill group of insecure losers''. The Dogecoin ($DOGE) founder said this after Robert Breedlove (a $BTC maximalist) described BTC as the ''future of warfare''

Elon Musk made a cryptic tweet referencing Dogecoin ($DOGE). The CEO said, ''Cry havoc! And let slip the Doges of war.'' However, this tweet had little effect on Dogecoin ($DOGE), as the token went bearish in the second week of July. On August 10, 2023, Dogecoin ($DOGE) traded at $0.07534. Dogecoin ($DOGE) was trading for $0.06711 on August 17, losing 10.22% in seven days. Later in the month, Dogecoin ($DOGE) fell again, and entered September trading at $0.06396. Analysts say Dogecoin ($DOGE) will surge if Elon Musk includes it on X.

On August 16, 2023, Shiba Inu's ($SHIB) much-anticipated Shibarium blockchain launched on Mainnet. However, Shibarium stepped straight into challenges. According to data from Beosin, crypto funds are stuck on the Shibarium cross-chain bridge . Reports say $1.7 million worth of $ETH and $762,000 worth of $BONE are locked on the blockchain. Shibarium has already registered 21 million wallets in the tesphase .

Shiba Inu ($SHIB) investors sold their tokens after this news broke. On August 10, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) traded for $0.000009729. A week later, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) lost 7.34%, and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) was trading at $0.000009083. As of September 2nd, Shiba Inu is trading at $ 0.000007817, dashing any hopes of a quick rebound. Analysts expected Shiba Inu ($SHIB) to rise after the Shibarium blockchain launch. Most analysts believe Shiba Inu ($SHIB) will only record a major price surge when the next bull cycle returns.

Domini.art ($DOMI) is an innovative art marketplace created to democratize high-end blue-chip art ownership. Hopeful art investors without a huge budget can own shares in prestigiartworks. It offers expert advisory to token holders by providing in-depth art market analysis, personalized recommendations, and due diligence.

This beginner cryptocurrency ensures the art investment process is fully secure by providing comprehensive insurance, specialized storage facilities, and conducting rigorauthenticity checks. Domini.art ($DOMI) will soon enter its first presale stage, where the token will sell for $0.0021. After all presale stages conclude, Domini.art ($DOMI) will hit the mainstream crypto market, trade for $0.0154, and deliver a massive 340% ROI to early investors.

Bitcoin was able to achieve gains that led it to the level of $28,227, which is the highest since late last August. Likewise, Ethereum was able to achieve noticeable gains, reaching the level of $1,755, which is also the highest level since mid-last August.

These gains in cryptocurrencies come with the bullish impression that characterizes the month of October in general, as Bitcoin has not recorded monthly losses in October since 2013 except twice, which prompted this month to be called ""Uptober"" within the cryptocurrency community.

The start of the new month came with more high sentiment among traders as well. According to data provided by CryptoQuant, the number of open interests of Bitcoin derivatives has risen to the highest levels since mid-August, with more than 8.442 billion contracts as of this morning at approximately 6:00 AM GMT.

While the sudden rise may cause further rises if open short positions are liquidated. This month, attention also remains on the decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a number of applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs, while expectations indicate the possibility of postponing the decision on these applications until next January.

Traders also remain focused on regulatory developments and actions taken by law enforcement agencies in the United States, whether from the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

historical data
 points towards the possibility of a similar trend this year. 


Over the past decade, Bitcoin's October performance has been 
notably bullish
, leaving many investors hopeful for a turnaround after recent challenging months. But while the past does offer a ray of optimism, the unpredictable nature of 
crypto markets
 means that the future remains uncertain.
 
A Decade Of October Gains For Bitcoin


Influencer Crypto Tony recently shed light on Bitcoin's historically positive performance in October. Sharing a decade-long chart of Bitcoin's 
track record
, Tony highlighted that eight of the past ten years have seen Bitcoin close October with commendable gains.




8/10 OUT OF 10 OCTOBERS HAVE BEEN BULLISH FOR THE MARKETS


We are still only 4 days in, plenty of time to see a nice bounce in the month and close green 
pic.twitter.com/xM4EhD7Jrs


— Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) 
October 4, 2023


The data speaks for itself; in 2021, Bitcoin soared by 39.93% in October, while 2020 saw an increase of 27.7%. In 2017, October ended with a bullish surge of 47.81%, and a 60.79% leap in 2013 is the most significant October gain yet.

Crypto Tony


It is worth noting that this analysis offers more than just numbers. It paints a picture of optimism for many in the crypto community, fostering hope that this October would again be favorable for Bitcoin. 


Tony, bullish in his perspective, remarked that although Bitcoin's current price may not seem overly promising, it's worth remembering we are in the early days of October. Thus, there's ample opportunity for the market to rebound.


Past Performance Vs. Future Predictability


However, some in the community advise caution, as with any trend analysis. Relying purely on historical data to forecast future market movement can be a precarious strategy. 


An anonymous user on platform X (formerly known as Twitter) 
voiced
 such concerns, arguing that while the future often exhibits patterns reminiscent of the past, it doesn't necessarily mirror it. 'Skeptical about 
predicting the future
 based solely on past results. The future often rhymes with the past but isn't an exact repeat,' they commented.


Notably, despite these reservations, investors often consider the historical positivity Bitcoin showcased in October. Whether or not the crypto will adhere to its 
previous patterns
 remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown quite an upward trajectory over the past week.
 
Notably, the top crypto has surged by 5.2% in the past 7 days and 1% in the past 24 hours, bringing its current market price to trade at $27,699 at the time of writing with a market capitalization of $9.6 billion.

reported
 net inflows of $21 million, breaking a persistent 
six-week drought
. With the crypto market's future continuously 
debated among experts
, such inflows mark a possible resurgence of confidence among investors.


The top cryptocurrency remained at the forefront of this resurgence, capturing most of the inflow. But as Bitcoin continues its dominance, emerging coins like Solana also signify the diversifying landscape of the crypto world. Amid these positive indicators, the Ethereum token, however, tells a different story.
 
Bitcoin And Solana Shine, Ethereum Faces The Heat


Leading the pack, Bitcoin funds reported an inflow of roughly $20.4 million in the past week. In sharp contrast, investment products betting on 
Bitcoin's decline
 witnessed an outflow of $1.5 million, suggesting a significant retreat from negative market sentiments. 


James Butterfill, CoinShares' Head of Research, pointed out the sustained relinquishment of short positions on Bitcoin, indicating a potential 
bullish sentiment
 for the top crypto.


Solana, a rising star in the crypto ecosystem, continued to impress. Reporting inflows for the 27th week this year, it added $5.1 million to its coffers, reiterating its strong market position. 


Butterfill acclaimed Solana's consistent performance, noting, 'Solana continues to shine,' emphasizing its resilience in a year that has seen numerous altcoins fluctuate.

CoinShares


On the flip side, 
Ethereum products
 haven't mirrored this positive trend. Despite being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, it registered outflows for the seventh week. 
Butterfill labeled Ethereum as the current 'least loved' altcoin.


Global Reactions And Influencing Factors On Crypto


Geographical dissections of the inflow trends offer noteworthy insights. While Europe and Canada embraced the crypto resurgence with inflows of $23 million and $17 million, respectively, the US displayed contrasting sentiments, pulling out $19 million.


Butterfill links this unexpected inflow towards the week's end to a blend of positive price momentum, apprehensions regarding US government debt prices, and the recent impasse over governmental funding. 


However, Butterfill also highlighted the low
 trading volumes across the investment product
 and crypto markets.


Amid these crypto currents, blockchain equities failed to catch the same wind, seeing outflows totaling $8.4 million. This trend mirrors the broader tech sector's direction, which also leaned towards a sell-off, as pointed out by Butterfill.
 
Notably, the fund flows in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana appear reflected even in their prices. While Bitcoin and Solana have spiked over the past day, recording a 3.3% and 6.2% upward trajectory, Ethereum has only seen a slight upward move of just 0.5% over the same period.

Bitcoin recently shattered the $28,000 th","(MENAFN- AsiaNet News) The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to volatility, and recent market trends have proven this once more. Bitcoin recently shattered the $28,000 threshold for the first time since August and shows signs of further growth. With machine learning algorithms forecasting even higher numbers for Bitcoin, reaching potentially beyond $30,000 by the end of October, the climate for cryptocurrency investments is teeming with both opportunity and risk. Against this tumultuous backdrop, enterprises like Scorpion Casino that leverage digital tokens are faced with unique challenges and possibilities.



Market Dynamics and Predictions: A Closer Look

The surge in Bitcoin's price didn't happen in isolation. It shot from $27,000 to $28,528 in a short span, leading to a significant increase in its market capitalization-from $528 billion to $552 billion. Such substantial jumps within hours signify the volatile yet lucrative nature of cryptocurrency investments. Analysts attribute this bullish trend to several factors, including the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the expected price surges associated with Bitcoin halving events.

The Role of Advanced Algorithms

The crypto investment landscape has evolved to incorporate sophisticated machine learning algorithms specialized in predicting market trends. These tools deploy a range of technical indicators, such as the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands, among others. For investors and ventures dealing with cryptocurrencies, these algorithms offer a chance to be better prepared for market fluctuations, allowing for more informed decision-making.



Scorpion Casino's Token Amid Market Volatility

In the midst of these sweeping crypto trends, Scorpion Casino's digital token becomes an interesting focus point. A bullish crypto market can potentially add substantial appeal to the casino's digital token as an investment option. If the token brings unique functionalities or advantages in the gaming environment, it can further amplify investor interest. Conversely, the volatile nature of the market also brings its set of challenges. Sharp downturns can erode the token's value and deter potential investors.







Strategy Adaptations for Scorpion Casino

The dynamic nature of the crypto market necessitates an agile approach for ventures like Scorpion Casino. While a bullish market offers a chance to attract more investors and elevate the token's value, a bearish turn could necessitate damage control measures to maintain investor trust. Strategic planning, therefore, becomes a cornerstone. The introduction of features like staking rewards, liquidity pools, or unique use-cases within the casino ecosystem could serve as strong incentives, making the token more resilient against market volatility.

A Barometer for Success or Failure

Ultimately, Scorpion Casino's digital token serves as a reflection of its adaptability and innovation in a volatile investment landscape. The rise or fall of its value is not merely a function of market trends but a measure of how adeptly the venture can pivot in reaction to these trends. By keenly observing market indicators and employing data-driven strategies, Scorpion Casino has the potential to turn market volatility into an asset rather than a liability.

In summary, while the crypto market's ups and downs offer a rollercoaster of challenges and opportunities, how Scorpion Casino navigates this landscape will be telling of its long-term viability. The casino's digital token is more than a financial asset; it's a gauge of the enterprise's adaptability and foresight in a complex and ever-changing financial ecosystem.

Bullish view

The BTC/USD pair continued falling as demand for cryptocurrencies waned. Bitcoin retreated to a low of $27,290 on Wednesday, lower than this month's high of $28,585. It has moved to the lowest point since October 6th and stocks diverge

Bitcoin and American equities have diverged in the past few days as the market focuses on the ongoing war in Israel. The war started on Saturday when armed Hamas attackers raided Israel, leading to thousands of death.

The financial market has reacted mildly to this crisis. American equities retreated briefly on Monday and then bounced back. This rally continued on Tuesday as the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 indices rose by 145 and 30 points, respectively.

American bond yields also retreated as some analysts predicted that the sell-off has bottomed. The US dollar index (DXY) retreated by more than 0.25% to $105.57, lower than last month's high of $107.50.

Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have pulled back this week. Bitcoin price dropped to $27,290 while the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has plunged to slightly above $1.03 trillion.

The next important catalyst that could have an impact on Bitcoin will be the upcoming US inflation data and Fed minutes. The Federal Reserve will publish the latest minutes later today. These minutes will show what the Fed members deliberated during the meeting. They will also provide hints about what to expect in the coming meetings.

The BTC/USD pair will also react to the upcoming US inflation data. Economists expect the data to show that inflation eased slightly in September even as gasoline prices rose. The average gas price rose to $3.85 during the month/USD technical analysis

The GBP/USD pair has been under pressure in the past few weeks. It has dropped from this month's high of 28,585 to the current 27,400. The pair has moved below the 50-period moving average while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the oversold level.

It is also approaching the key support at 27,140 and has retreated below 27,460 (September 19th high). Therefore, the pair will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support at 26,500. The stop-loss of this view will be at 28,000.

Bearish view

Bitcoin price has done well in the past two weeks even as risks in the financial market continued. The BTC/USD pair was trading at 28,000 on Monday, higher than last month's low of 24,800 is doing well

The BTC/USD pair has held quite steady in the past few weeks even as risks to the global economy continued. For example, America's bond yields continued their remarkable sell-off last week, which pushed their yields to the highest points since 2007.

The 30-year yield was trading at 4.96% on Monday while the 10-year rose to 4.79%. In most periods, soaring yields and a yield curve inversion are usually signs of a recession.

Therefore, Bitcoin's price action is notable since many investors are moving from risky assets to the safety of money market funds.

Bitcoin has also outperformed American stocks in the past few weeks. While its price has moved sideways, key indices like the Dow Jones and the Russell 2,000 indices have retreated sharply.

The BTC/USD pair reacted mildly to the latest American jobs data. These numbers revealed that the economy added over 336k jobs in September after creating over 227k in the previous month.

While the unemployment rate rose to 3.8% and wages slowed to 4.2%, the labor market is still strong. These jobs numbers led to a risk-off sentiment as the US dollar index (DXY) retreated to $105.8 while American equities jumped.

The next key catalysts that could move Bitcoin will be the latest Federal Reserve minutes and US inflation data. Economists expect the data to show that the headline CPI slipped from 3.7% in August to 3.6% in September even as gasoline prices rose/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has done well in the past few days. On the daily chart, it has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued rising. It is nearing the overbought level of 70.

The pair has also formed what looks like an inverted head and shoulders pattern, a common bullish sign. It is also above the crucial support level at 27,383, the highest point on September 19th.

Therefore, the pair will likely continue rising as buyers target the key resistance level at 29,000. The stop-loss of this trade will be at 27,000.

Bitcoin has been the face of the cryptocurrency revolution since its inception in 2009. However, as technology evolves, so do iterations of cryptocurrencies. This evolution is often through a process called ""forking,"" which leads to the creation of new versions of cryptocurrencies, each with its unique features and functionalities. In this article, we aim to delve into the world of Bitcoin forks, their impact on the cryptocurrency market, and how they have contributed to the growth and diversification of blockchain technology.

Forking, in the context of blockchain technology, refers to a situation where the existing protocol of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, undergoes significant changes, resulting in an entirely new version of the cryptocurrency. These changes are usually the result of desired improvements to the functionality or growth, leading to the creation of a new blockchain with altered rules.

There are two types of forks: hard forks, and soft forks. Hard forks involve radical changes to the existing protocol, leading to the formation of a new cryptocurrency. On the other hand, soft forks are subtle modifications to the software, which users and miners can adapt to over time.

Since the inception of Bitcoin, there have been numerous forks, leading to the creation of multiple Bitcoin offshoots. Some of these forks have led to significant innovations, while others have faded into obscurity. Here is an overview of some of the most notable historical Bitcoin forks:

Launched in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, Litecoin is one of the earliest ""altcoins"". It was built on Bitcoin's original source code but aimed to improve Bitcoin, particularly in terms of transaction speed. Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm, Scrypt, which enables faster transaction times.

Bitcoin XT, launched in 2014 by one of Bitcoin's original developers, Mike Hearn, aimed to increase the number of transactions per second. However, Bitcoin XT eventually lost its momentum and is no longer available.

Bitcoin Classic, similar to Bitcoin XT, proposed increasing the block size to improve transaction capacity. Although it has lost its popularity, Bitcoin Classic still has some active nodes.

The Bitcoin SegWit update in 2017 changed the way information was transferred on the blockchain. It allowed for larger blocks by removing signature data from Bitcoin transactions, thereby freeing up more space for transactions.

Bitcoin Cash, launched in August 2017, is a result of a hard fork from the original Bitcoin protocol. The primary difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash lies in their block sizes. BCH has a larger block size, which allows each block in the blockchain to hold a larger number of transactions, resulting in greater throughput.

Bitcoin Gold is a Bitcoin fork that uses an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work mining algorithm, allowing anyone to mine it without the need for specialized computer hardware.

While investing in Bitcoin forks can be lucrative due to the potential for high returns, it also carries a high level of risk due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider seeking advice from financial advisors before venturing into investing in Bitcoin forks. Historically, all Bitcoin forks, hard or soft, have seen prices significantly higher than their launch price.

One fork on many watchlists currently is Bitcoin Spark, which utilizes a style of Proof-of-Work like Bitcoin, but rather than wasting the processing power and energy simply to confirm transactions, Bitcoin Spark pushes the majority of this consumption into processing power that can be rented by 'customers' of the blockchain. This provides a product and revenue generation layer onto the network that does not exist in many other blockchains. By integrating this product layer it means the inflation of the cryptocurrency is considerably less than if miners were simply taking income from the minting of new coins.

This is a huge leap forward in how cryptocurrency forks will be considered, and projects will certainly consider setting up a revenue-generating product layer as an integrated part of the ecosystem. Many investors in BTCS are likely seeing a similar opportunity for the coin to reach significantly higher prices than the launch.

Bitcoin has rallied 11% in the past month, crossing above the $27,000 threshold and leading many analysts to reconsider whether the $30,000 level could be in play again this year.

The strength of the world's largest cryptocurrency remains uncertain, however, and Bitcoin analysts are divided on what's next for BTC.

BTC Rallies as Courts Side with Grayscale Over Bitcoin ETF

The shift in sentiment around Bitcoin from bearish to bullish can be traced back to a legal decision in late August. After months of speculation, a court decided that the SEC had arbitrarily denied Grayscale's application to turn its Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.

The decision cleared the way for a spot Bitcoin ETF and could usher in a new wave of Bitcoin trading. A spot Bitcoin ETF would be far more accessible to retail traders and non-crypto retirement investors than most existing vehicles for crypto investment.

In the past month, the SEC has delayed its decision on approving any BItcoin ETF , signaling that it could still be months before an approval. However, that hasn't slowed the momentum in BTC, which is up 11% since the court decision.

Analysts Divided on Whether Bitcoin Can Continue Rally

Despite the recent bullish momentum, there are still many headwinds facing Bitcoin. A hawkish Fed has signaled that it could raise interest rates further. Yields from relatively safe investments like US treasuries have exploded higher. And the SEC could further delay or even block the launch of Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF.

These factors have made analysts cautious in predicting continued gains for Bitcoin.

One of the most bullish analysts, Michaël van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, predicted on X that Bitcoin will retest the $26,700-$26,900 level before making a move in the direction of $30,000. He doesn't specify a timeline for when such a retest could occur.

Other analysts are more circumspect. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, has said that the crypto market hasn't yet priced in the continued hawkishness of the Fed . That could result in severe whiplash in Bitcoin's price before it reaches $30,000.

Bitcoin Minetrix Emerges as BTC Alternative, Launches Stake-to-Mine Ecosystem for Cloud Mining

While Bitcoin's future remains uncertain, a new cryptocurrency is launching to enable more investors to play a role in Bitcoin mining.

Bitcoin Minetrix is a new crypto project building the world's first stake-to-mine ecosystem. Investors in Bitcoin Minetrix's $BTCMTX token can stake their coins and earn mining credits. These credits can be redeemed for mining hashpower, enabling investors to earn BTC.

This ecosystem solves one of the biggest problems with cloud Bitcoin mining. With Bitcoin Minetrix, investors never need to send tokens to an unknown mining farm. Instead, they keep their $BTCMTX safely locked and send non-transferrable mining credits instead.

It's a simple and secure solution that eliminates the need for trust in the cloud. Bitcoin Minetrix plans to start out by renting hashpower from existing mining farms and ultimately to build its own datacenter.

Regardless of what happens to the price of BTC in the coming months, mining has the potential to be lucrative.

That reality is reflected in the massive demand for $BTCMTX during the Bitcoin Minetrix presale. The presale has already raised more than $500,000 and is rapidly approaching its soft cap.

For now, investors can buy $BTCMTX at a price of $0.011. However, time is running out before the price of this stake-to-mine token increases.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis on 28th September that if anything, I suspected an upwards price movement beyond the current range is suggested as more likely than a downwards one from the recent price action.

This was a good call.

The technical picture now has changed a bit – the price has risen over the past couple of weeks, but over recent days has traded within a narrowing, consolidating triangle pattern .

There is a resistance level within this triangle at $27,750 which looks quite likely to hold if reached, so it will probably be today's pivotal point.

Traders might look to go short there at a bearish reversal, or long if there are two consecutive hourly closes above it.

There is nothing of high importance due today concerning the US Dollar.

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline transported 3.820 million tons of Turkmen and Kazakh oil from January through September 2023, Trend reports.

Data from the State Statistics Committee of Azerbaijan shows that this figure is 16.9 percent of the total volume of oil transported through the pipeline during the reporting period.

The total volume of oil transported through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline from January through September 2023 amounted to 22.665 million tons. The remaining 83.1 percent (18.844 million tons) of the total volume of oil supplied through this pipeline was Azerbaijani oil.

Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan accounted for 76.2 percent of the 29.787 million tons of oil transported through Azerbaijan's main oil pipelines during the reporting period of 2023.

During the same period in 2022, 27.505 million tons of oil were transported through the main oil pipelines of Azerbaijan. 78.9 percent, or 21.688 million tons, of this oil was transported via the BTC.

Currently, the BTC pipeline transports mainly crude oil from Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli and condensate from Shah Deniz. In addition, volumes of oil and condensate from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan continue to be transported via the BTC.

Previously, Azerbaijani Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov said that deliveries via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline from Kazakhstan would amount to 1.1 million tons of oil by the end of 2023.

""Every month, Azerbaijan receives from 12 to 14 tankers transporting Kazakh oil. This is a satisfactory development. The initial agreement between the parties provided for the transportation of 1.5 million tons of oil this year. However, given that deliveries began in April this year, we will be able to transport 1,1 million tons of oil by the end of 2023,"" he said.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/14/TNA_cf562image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.912315,ac484c68418c1b9109b572f584ffdba0

From Blackjack to Bitcoin, there's something for everyone this week.

First on this week's menu, the famous Blackjack Quest – your chance to tuck into a tasty $75 just by playing Blackjack 21. Take a seat opposite the dealer and if they serve you up a natural blackjack, a coloured blackjack, a club-suited blackjack, and two or more blackjacks in the same game… you'll bag that bonus.

Simply tap to the Tangente tab in Juicy Stakes' Casino Lobby, load up the card classic and play. You can embark on this week's Quest from 9th - 15th October.

Now for the main course – between 180 and 300 Free Spins up for grabs, courtesy of a couple of crazy cryptocurrency specials.

Don't use crypto? Don't worry – you can still get in on the action. This offer is available for all deposit methods – although you will earn a little extra if you use Bitcoin and Lightning Bitcoin. Here's how things work:

To claim your first 150 Free Spins, deposit $25 of Bitcoin and enter 72COIN for 60 Free Spins on the magical 72 Fortunes. Then deposit another $50+ with code WISHBIT, and you'll get 90 more for Wish Granted. You don't even need to rub the genie's lamp.

If you do deposit another way, you'll receive 30 less spins each time – but that's still a nice 90 Free Spins each time. And that goes for this next offer too – only this time it's using Lightning Bitcoin.

So to claim a cool 60 Free Spins on Stay Frosty, deposit $25 or more of Lightning Bitcoin alongside the bonus code FROSTCOIN. For your next 90, the code is BITLUCK with a $50+ deposit – that'll set you spinning on the brilliant Far Eastern adventure, Bounding Luck. It is the Year of the Rabbit, after all!

October 10, 2023 by Mark Allinson Leave a Comment

In the rapidly evolving intersection of finance and technology, cryptocurrencies have gained prominence as a noteworthy contender, spearheaded by Bitcoin.

The evolution of Bitcoin and the consequent proliferation of diverse cryptocurrencies have triggered a digital phenomenon reminiscent of the gold rush, fundamentally reshaping our perspectives and behaviors surrounding currency, investments, and financial transactions.

While platforms like BitAlpha AI have made trading these digital assets more accessible, it's imperative to understand the historical context and potential future of cryptocurrencies.

Understanding Cryptocurrencies: A Paradigm Shift in Finance

Cryptocurrencies signify a transformative paradigm shift in the way we conduct transactions involving value. Leading this transformative wave is Bitcoin, frequently referred to as digital gold because of its finite supply and its ability to serve as a store of value.

In contrast to conventional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies function in a decentralized manner, utilizing blockchain technology – a distributed ledger system that guarantees the security, transparency, and permanence of transactions.

Bitcoin: The Pioneer and the Game-Changer

Bitcoin, introduced by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, marked the beginning of the cryptocurrency era. It served as a response to the global financial crisis, aiming to provide an alternative to the centralized banking system.

The scarcity of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million coins, has fueled its demand as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty.

Navigating the Cryptocurrency Landscape Altcoins: Beyond Bitcoin

While Bitcoin continues to serve as the primary representative of cryptocurrencies, a multitude of alternative coins, or altcoins, have surfaced, each distinguished by its own distinct attributes and practical applications.

This innovation allows for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Conversely, Ripple places its emphasis on expediting and reducing the cost of international transactions.

Investment Opportunities and Risks

The rise of cryptocurrencies has led to unprecedented investment opportunities. Investors, both institutional and retail, have sought exposure to this emerging asset class. However, it's crucial to recognize that with great potential comes substantial risk.

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, susceptible to sudden price fluctuations influenced by market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements.

The Role of Regulation and Adoption Regulatory Outlook: Navigating Uncharted Waters

The landscape of regulations pertaining to cryptocurrencies is in a state of constant evolution. Governments and regulatory entities across the globe are actively addressing the classification and supervision of this emerging category of assets.

While certain countries have welcomed the adoption of cryptocurrencies, others remain cautious due to apprehensions related to issues like money laundering, tax evasion, and safeguarding the interests of consumers.

Mainstream Adoption: A Steady Climb

Cryptocurrencies have made significant strides in achieving mainstream adoption. Major companies like Tesla, Square, and PayPal now accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world.

Moreover, some countries are exploring the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which could reshape the global financial system.

Security and Custodianship: Safeguarding Your Digital Assets The Importance of Security

As the popularity of cryptocurrencies grows, ensuring the security of digital assets has become paramount. Cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and platforms have been targets of hacking attempts, resulting in significant losses.

Implementing robust security measures, such as two-factor authentication and cold storage, is essential for safeguarding investments.

The Future of Cryptocurrencies: Innovations and Possibilities DeFi and Beyond

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) stands out as a significant phenomenon in the realm of cryptocurrencies. DeFi platforms introduce conventional financial functionalities like lending, borrowing, and trading, but they do so in a manner that is both decentralized and permissionless.

The primary objective of this movement is to revolutionize the structure of finance, enhancing its inclusivity and global accessibility for individuals across the globe.

Scalability and Sustainability

As the utilization of cryptocurrencies continues to increase, significant issues regarding scalability and energy usage have become prominent. The proof-of-work consensus mechanism employed by Bitcoin, while ensuring security, requires considerable computational resources.

To tackle these issues, initiatives are in progress to shift towards more environmentally sustainable consensus mechanisms, like the proof-of-stake method.

Conclusion

As the digital gold rush continues, navigating this complex terrain requires a deep understanding of the nuances, risks, and opportunities that cryptocurrencies bring.

From decentralized finance to mainstream adoption and regulatory dynamics, the world of cryptocurrencies is in constant flux, promising a future where financial empowerment is truly democratized.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/10/R&AN_62ed4image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.2666335,5ff6bb55969ba89c22457b5462c0914d

Gardin explains the ideas behind the Method A and Method B enhancements, likening them to ""boosters"" for the crypto mining process.

He says Method A seamlessly integrates with Intel-based mining rigs, thanks to their cooperation, while Method B has required intricate reverse engineering. Gardin says that his current fois on business development, liaising with major miners in North America, and fine-tuning product engineering.

He expects that the next major milestone for the company will be to implement Method B in partnership with a functioning mining rig.

A Dive Into Last Week's Crypto Asset Inflows,Samuel Edyme,2023-10-10 00:00:08,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-outshines-bitcoin-a-dive-into-last-weeks/,newsbtc.com,"Last week marked a noteworthy surge for Solana in terms of inflows, leading the pack in altcoin investment interests and outshining Bitcoin...","Last week marked a noteworthy surge for Solana in inflows, leading the pack in altcoin investment interests and outshining Bitcoin. Solana's recent performance particularly placed it in the spotlight as it amassed roughly $24 million, the altcoin r
egistered its largest inflow since March 2022, according to a recent 
report
 from Coinshares.


A Closer Look: Dissecting The Solana Inflow Surge


Diving into the numbers, the broader digital-asset investment domain observed net inflows for the second consecutive week, accumulating a significant $78 million, showcasing a 
bullish sentiment
 reminiscent of July's performance.
 
While Bitcoin, the quintessential crypto giant, continued to dominate, Solana grabbed headlines. As 
highlighted
 by James Butterfill, Head of Research, Solana's re-emergence as a sought-after altcoin 
signifies its growing appeal among digital investors, especially in light of recent Ethereum futures ETF product launches. 


According to the report, with a noteworthy track record for 2023, Solana funds reported inflows for 28 weeks, with a mere four weeks registering outflows.


Always a major player, Bitcoin recorded inflows of $43 million. The report disclosed that a certain subset of investors, potentially riding on Bitcoin's recent price momentum, initiated positions in short-bitcoin products, leading to an inflow of $1.2 million within the week.

Diverging Investment Patterns: Europe Leads While ETH ETFs Underwhelm


Geographically, Europe continued its digital asset supremacy, accounting for 90% of the total inflows. On the contrary, the combined inflows from the US and Canada totaled a mere $9 million. According to Butterfill, this noticeable regional disparity in investment sentiments underscores evolving market dynamics and investor preferences.


Adding to the digital fervor, trading volumes for exchange-traded products surged by 37%, settling at $1.13 billion for the week. Trusted exchanges dealing with Bitcoin also witnessed a 16% jump in trading volume.


However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. The recent US launch of six Ethereum futures ETFs 
raked below $10 million
. While seemingly substantial, Butterfill termed the response as showcasing a 'tepid appetite,' particularly when juxtaposed against the $1 billion amassed by Bitcoin futures ETFs in their inaugural week back in 2021. 


However, Butterfill attributed this difference more to the contrasting market environments and the 'poor investor appetite' for digital assets rather than a direct reflection of the asset's potential.
 
Furthermore, regardless of the recorded positive inflows from Solana last week, the 
altcoin
 is currently facing a bloodbath along with Bitcoin. Notably, Solana has declined by nearly 10% in the past week and 4.5% in the past 24 hours, with a market price of $22.30 at the time of writing.

In contrast, Bitcoin has also shed its portion of losses, down by 2.9% in the past 7 days and 1.4% in the past day, with a trading price currently at $27,518.

439,Impending Crypto Exchange Listing: A Closer Look At Bitcoin Spark's Exciting Announcement,MENAFN,2023-10-09 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107210550/Impending-Crypto-Exchange-Listing-A-Closer-Look-At-Bitcoin-Sparks-Exciting-Announcement,menafn.com,--News Direct-- The world of digital currency is abuzz with the exciting news of Bitcoin Spark's impending exchange listing. This article o,"The world of digital currency is abuzz with the exciting news of Bitcoin Spark's impending exchange listing. This article offers an in-depth exploration of this significant event, its potential impact, and what it could mean for the future of Bitcoin Spark.

Bitcoin Spark is no ordinary cryptocurrency. This digital asset is a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform that stands out with its unique features in the cryptocurrency market. Its primary goal is to provide users with a secure, efficient, and reliable way to conduct transactions, all while maintaining complete privacy.

The first unique feature of Bitcoin Spark is its innovative proof-of-process consenmechanism. This mechanism eliminates the need for resource-intensive mining, making Bitcoin Spark more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than many other cryptocurrencies. It also ensures faster transaction processing times, thereby enhancing user experience.

Moreover, Bitcoin Spark provides its users with a higher degree of privacy. It uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that transaction details remain confidential. This level of privacy is particularly beneficial for businesses and individuals who want to protect their financial information from potential threats.

The listing of a cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange is a significant milestone in its lifecycle. Such a listing provides the cryptocurrency with a platform for trading, thereby increasing its visibility and credibility in the market. It also opens up the cryptocurrency to a larger audience of potential investors, tpotentially increasing its value.

One of the biggest benefits of a crypto exchange listing is the liquidity it provides. With more people having access to trade cryptocurrency, the volume of transactions increases. This higher trading volume leads to greater liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the cryptocurrency without significantly impacting its price.

Furthermore, a crypto exchange listing often signals the maturity of a cryptocurrency. It shows that the cryptocurrency has met the stringent requirements set by the exchange, including those related to security and regulatory compliance. This can enhance the reputation of the cryptocurrency and boost investor confidence.

For Bitcoin Spark, a crypto exchange listing represents a validation of its innovative features and potential value. It also provides an opportunity for Bitcoin Spark to expand its user base, as more people will be able to buy and sell it on the exchange.

The listing could also increase the visibility of Bitcoin Spark. As it gets listed on the exchange, financial news outlets and cryptocurrency blogs will likely cover the event, generating publicity for Bitcoin Spark. This increased visibility could attract more investors, potentially driving up the price of Bitcoin Spark.

Moreover, the listing could enhance the credibility of Bitcoin Spark. By meeting the stringent requirements for listing, Bitcoin Spark shows that it is a legitimate and secure cryptocurrency. This could increase investor confidence and encourage more people to hold Bitcoin Spark.

In general, a crypto exchange listing can have a significant impact on the value of a cryptocurrency. The increased visibility and credibility that come with a listing can lead to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving up its price.

For instance, when Bitcoin was first listed on an exchange, its price skyrocketed. Similarly, other cryptocurrencies have seen substantial price increases following their listings on popular exchanges like Binance.

However, it's important to note that a listing does not guarantee a price increase. The price of a cryptocurrency is influenced by a variety of factors, including market sentiment, investor demand, and the overall state of the crypto market. Therefore, while a listing can help increase the visibility and credibility of a cryptocurrency, its impact on the price can vary.

While it's difficult to make precise predictions about the future of Bitcoin Spark post-listing, there are several potential outcomes based on historical trends. The increased visibility and credibility from the listing could attract more investors, potentially driving up the price of Bitcoin Spark.

Furthermore, the listing could lead to increased adoption of Bitcoin Spark. As more people become aware of its unique features and benefits, they may be more inclined to use Bitcoin Spark for their transactions. This increased usage could further drive up the price of Bitcoin Spark.

However, as with any investment, there are also risks involved. The price of Bitcoin Spark could fluctuate due to market volatility. Therefore, investors should always do their research and consider their risk tolerance before investing in any cryptocurrency.

There are several examples of successful crypto exchange listings that Bitcoin Spark can learn from. For instance, when Ethereum was listed on varicrypto exchanges, its price increased significantly. This was largely due to the increased visibility and credibility that the listings provided.

Another example is Litecoin, which saw a substantial price increase following its listing on Coinbase. The listing not only gave Litecoin greater visibility but also signaled to investors that it was a credible and reliable cryptocurrency.

These examples show that a crypto exchange listing can have a significant impact on the value of a cryptocurrency. However, they also underscore the importance of having a strong underlying product. Both Ethereum and Litecoin had unique features and benefits that attracted investors, which contributed to their success post-listing.

As Bitcoin Spark prepares for its impending crypto exchange listing, there's a lot of anticipation about what this could mean for its future. Given the unique features of Bitcoin Spark and the potential benefits of a crypto exchange listing, there's a possibility that the listing could lead to increased visibility, credibility, and value for Bitcoin Spark.

However, as with any investment, it's important to conduct thorough research and consider the potential risks. The world of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile, and while a crypto exchange listing can provide opportunities, it also comes with uncertainties.

But one thing is certain: the impending listing of Bitcoin Spark is an exciting development, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds. For those interested in the world of cryptocurrencies, this is definitely a space to watch.

UXUY
 will officially implement the Bitcoin Lightning Network node named UXUY. As part of the Bitcoin Layer2 plan which we aptly named- 'UXUY Struck By Lightning'. The implementation of the Lightning Network node marks UXUY's journey to becoming an active contributor, improving the Bitcoin ecosystem, and promoting the development of the Lightning Network.

UXUY 
differs
 from other traditional Bitcoin contributors because we focus more on connecting Bitcoin assets to Ethereum, BNB chains, and other ecosystems. 
We have successfully connected to Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Tron, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche-C, Fantom, Linea, Base, and other public chains, and through our exclusive GasPool solution, we have reduced the threshold for cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and other ecosystems.
 
At present, UXUY has successfully run the Bitcoin Lightning Network node and built infrastructure for trading Bitcoin Layer2 assets, actively participated in the construction of the Taproot Assets test network, and is well prepared for the upcoming Bitcoin DeFi Summer.
 
 
The First DEX to Implement the Lightning Network Node
 
In 2020, Bitfinex officially announced the operation of Lightning Network nodes, and since then, major CEXs have successively connected to the Lightning Network. Currently, traditional CEXs such as Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, and OKX have completed the integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
 
CEXs connected to the Lightning Network are mainly used in deposits and withdrawals, taking only partial advantage of the Lightning Network. With this situation, we can see that in the face of the upcoming outbreak of Taproot Assets, there is no ready solution for users.
 
As a next-generation DEX, UXUY is the first DEX to run a Lightning Network node and, with this move, promote the integration of DeFi and the Bitcoin ecosystem. As UXUY co-founder Jordan has said, 'Currently, the scale of Bitcoin assets on the Lightning Network is only 5,000+ BTC, equivalent to US$100 million. In contrast, the size of USDT is US$86.6 billion. To promote the development of the Bitcoin Lightning Network ecosystem, we can not be limited to the existing asset scale of the Lightning Network. The advantage of UXUY is to introduce Stablecoin and Token assets to realize decentralized multi-chain transactions. This is the essential difference between us and traditional Lightning Network products (such as Walletofsatoshi, Phoenix, Muun).'
 
Elizabeth Stark, co-founder of Lightning Network, has also affirmed UXUY's stance on the matter. In a statement, she said,
 
 
Taproot Assets helps Bitcoin in numerous ways, including onboarding people to Bitcoin through fiat where they can easily swap between assets. This is particularly useful in a high-inflation environment, as many people around the world live in economies where their currencies are continually losing value. Thus, Taproot Assets helps facilitate fiat to Bitcoin rails. Further, as Taproot Assets uses bitcoin liquidity to route assets issued on the protocol, there will be greater demand for bitcoin on the Lightning Network. As a result, bitcoin will route dollars, fiat, and everything in between. 
This is how we bitcoinize the dollar.
 
 
We believe UXUY's move to implement a Lightning Network node may have a ripple effect throughout the industry, driving more DEXs to support the Bitcoin Lightning Network. As more and more users join the network, the Lightning Network's node and channel scale may once again reach new heights.
 
Multi-chain transactions for Taproot Assets
 
UXUY will fully open Lightning Network nodes to the Taproot Assets ecosystem and promote the construction of Lightning Network infrastructures. As the next generation of decentralized multi-chain trading platform, UXUY will improve the trading environment of Taproot Assets, launch BLIP — define the trading layer based on Bitcoin Taproot Assets, and enrich the liquidity of Taproot Assets.
 
UXUY will help Taproot Assets' asset issuers complete project deployment, issuance, and liquidity management. Significantly reducing the cost for project parties to issue assets on the Lightning Network, especially for the DeFi and RWA fields, UXUY will provide rich development tools and Bitcoin Lightning Network node support.
 
UXUY has exclusively created uPool to serve multi-chain pipelines. 
Its core is to allow stablecoins to play a more active role in cross-chain transactions. This will help users use existing assets to directly trade Taproot Assets, greatly reducing users' costs. Cross-chain transaction threshold.
 
UXUY's implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network node is just the first step in Struck By Lightning. If you are also a Crypto Native, join UXUY in Struck By Lightning!
 
About Lightning Network
The Lightning Network is a Layer2 solution for Bitcoin. Due to the limitations of Bitcoin's scalability, the Bitcoin network can only handle 5 to 7 transactions per second on average, which is far from meeting people's transaction needs. Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja first proposed the idea of Lightning Network in February 2015 and released a 
white paper
 on Lightning Network in January 2016. Lightning Network was officially born. The Lightning Network greatly improves the transaction throughput of the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the core protocol of the Bitcoin network. The Lightning Network guarantees millions to billions of transactions per second, as well as cross-chain atomic swaps.

Bitcoin price surged briefly to $30,000 as respected media outlets published some ETF fake news. The BTC/USD pair retreated to $28,585, still, its highest point on October 2nd. It has jumped by more than $3,000 from the lowest level in September ETF news

Bitcoin jumped after several media companies reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the iShares Bitcoin Trust by Blackrock. The news trended in key social media networks like Twitter and StockTwits, pushing many traders to buy Bitcoin and other coins.

The news was fake and the SEC is still reviewing applications by other companies like Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Ark. The report came a few days after the SEC said that it would not appeal its recent legal loss against Grayscale, which runs the biggest Bitcoin fund in the world.

Therefore, analysts believe that the SEC will ultimately approve at least one fund in the coming weeks or months. If this happens, it will lead to more inflows into Bitcoin from institutional investors.

Bitcoin also soared as investors reacted to the ongoing risk-off sentiment in the market. This view was characterized by a weaker US dollar and strong stocks. The dollar index retreated to $106 while the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices rose by more than 1%.

This rally happened even as the war between Israel and Hamas continued. It is unclear how the war will end with some experts expecting it to be a long and bloody fight. If this happens, it means that inflation could remain high for a while. Data published on Friday revealed that inflation expectations rose to the highest level in months in September/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong bullish trend after bottoming at 26,500 last week. This rally saw it retest the crucial psychological level at 28,609, the highest level on October 2nd. It has also jumped above the 25-period and 50-period moving averages, meaning that buyers are still in control.

The relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued rising and moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the outlook for Bitcoin is bullish, with the next level to watch being at 29,500. The stop-loss of this trade is at the psychological point at 27,500.

Bitcoin price outperformed stocks on Wednesday as macro risks continued rising. The BTC/USD pair was trading at 28,287, much higher than this week's low of 27,500. It remains a few points below the week-to-date high of 30,000 ETF Hopes Rise

Bitcoin has done relatively well in the past few days as investors reacted to the ongoing hopes. On Monday, Bitcoin surged after a fake report said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved Blackrock's ETF.

It then retreated but remained at an elevated level after Blackrock denied the report. And on Wednesday, Fidelity, one of the biggest companies in the financial services industry, announced that it had modified its ETF application.

In the amendment, the company explained how it will safeguard user funds and prevent market manipulation. It also explained how it will explain the risks associated with the fund.

In addition to Fidelity and Blackrock, other companies like VanEck, Ark Invest, and Franklin Templeton have applied for spot ETFs. Analysts believe that an ETF will lead to more inflows from institutional investors.

Bitcoin ETF hopes explain why Bitcoin outperformed American equities. The Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 indices retreated by more than 1% as the price of crude oil surged. Brent jumped to $92 leading to elevated inflation fears.

As a result, the bond sell-off continued, with the 30-year Treasuries surging to 5.05%, the highest level since 2007. Mortgage rates also soared to 8%, putting more pressure on American consumers.

From a macro perspective, Bitcoin price will react to the upcoming statement by Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair. In it, he will likely provide more information about what to expect in the coming meeting. On Wednesday, Patrick Harker recommended that the bank should continue pausing/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has done modestly well in the past few days. On the 4H chart, Bitcoin's current price ($28,290) is along the highest point on October 5th. It has formed a bullish pennant pattern, which is a positive sign for the coin. Bitcoin is also above the 25-day moving average and the first resistanc of the Woodie pivot point.

Bitcoin's volume has also remained at an elevated level. Therefore, there is a likelihood that it will soon have a bullish breakout, with the next target being at 29,500.

The BTC/USD price moved sideways in the past few days as the recent momentum faded. Bitcoin was trading at $28,465, where it has been stuck at since Monday. The price remains below this week's high of about $30,000. It has risen by more than 7% from its lowest level this month.

Bitcoin's volume and futures open interest jumped on Monday after a fake news report suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved Blackrock's ETF proposal. The SEC is still considering proposals by companies like Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco.

In an interview, Blackrock's CEO, Larry Fink confirmed that his company was seeing more demand for the coin from its global customers. He also noted that most of this demand is happening as investors move to safe assets as geopolitical risks rise price forecast

The BTC/USD price rose to the psychological level at $30,000 on Monday and then retreated to the current $28,465. This price was important since it was the highest swing on October 2nd.

Bitcoin has moved above the crucial support level at $24,790, the lowest swing in September and June this year. It has formed a double-bottom pattern, which is a popular bullish sign.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued rising and is nearing the overbought level. Notably, Bitcoin's volume has also risen modestly.

Therefore, the outlook for the BTC/USD pair is bullish as buyers attempt to retest the highest level this week. A break above this price will see bulls targeting the year-to-date high of 32,000. In this regard, the stop-loss of this trade will be at 26,475, the lowest swing last week.

The BTC/USD pair remained in a consolidation phase in the past few days as investors wait for the next key catalyst. Bitcoin price was trading at $26,928, where it has remained stuck at since Thursday last week. This price is much lower than the year-to-date high of 32,200 Bitcoin news

The BTC/USD pair was in a tight range on Monday even after positive news in the United States. In a statement, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that it will not appeal the Grayscale lawsuit.

The Grayscale lawsuit forced the SEC to reconsider the company's conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. GBTC is the biggest Bitcoin fund in the world, with over $15 billion.

Grayscale hopes to change the fund into an ETF in a bid to reduce its discount to the Net Asset Value (NAV). The discount to NAV has recovered modestly in the past few months and currently stands at -15.87%, higher than the year-to-date low of -43%. This is a sign that many investors believe that the SEC will finally approve the ETF.

In addition to Grayscale, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering ETF proposals by companies like Blackrock, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. An ETF approval will be a positive thing for Bitcoin because it will lead to more inflows from institutional investors

Bitcoin has also remained steady in the past few days even as the war in Israel continues. The war is leading to rising concerns about inflation if it continues escalating in the coming months. This will happen only if other countries in the Middle East like Iran join the conflict.

If this happens, there is a likelihood that inflation will remain at an elevated level in the next few months. High inflation will lead to a more hawkish Federal Reserve/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has moved sideways in the past few days. It has remained below the psychological level of 27,000 since October 11th. It has remained below the key resistance at 27,140, the lowest level since October 13th.

Bitcoin is also consolidating at the 50-period Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA) while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has drifted upwards. It has also formed a rising wedge pattern, which is usually a bearish sign.

Therefore, there is a likelihood that Bitcoin will continue falling as sellers target the key support at 26,500. The stop-loss of this trade will be at 27,460.

Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.
 (NASDAQ:
MARA
) (""Marathon"" or ""Company"")
, a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, has added a new, enterprise-grade custodian to allow it to diversify its bitcoin treasury with multiple providers.
 
As Marathon continues to increase its hash rate, it has grown its bitcoin holdings to 13,726 as of September 30, 2023. In September 2023, the Company produced 1,242 bitcoin, representing 4.3% of the available rewards for all Bitcoin miners during the month. Historically, Marathon has custodied all its bitcoin with a single provider. As part of its broader treasury management strategy, the Company has added a new, enterprise-grade custodian as its second custodian. Marathon may continue to diversify its bitcoin custody across additional custodians in the future.
 
'Diversification is a core component of our strategy that applies not just to our operations but to our treasury management as well,' said Salman Khan, Marathon's chief financial officer. 'Our existing custodian has played, and will continue to play, a valuable role in our treasury management strategy. However, with 13,726 bitcoin on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and our growing operations producing over 1,000 bitcoin per month, we believe it is an opportune time to diversify our bitcoin custody across multiple custodians. Our second custodian provides enterprise-grade digital asset solutions and is one of the most experienced institutions in the space. We are optimistic that their role as a custodian will complement our current solutions.'

This sta","(MENAFN) According to a US-based news agency's report on Sunday, the U.S. government has emerged as one of the significant holders of cryptocurrency. This status has been achieved through the seizure of approximately 200,000 bitcoins, which are currently valued in the billions of dollars. The report is based on an analysis of public filings conducted by the cryptocurrency firm 21.co.



194,188 bitcoins, valued at USD5.3 billion, are believed to be in hardware wallets under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other government organizations, according to 21.co, which states that these are 'lower-bound estimations of the US government holdings based on publicly available information.'



The analysis conducted by the cryptocurrency company monitored the flow of bitcoins to and from U.S. government accounts linked to the three most substantial cryptocurrency seizures that have occurred since 2020.



A notable illustration is the involvement in the Bitfinex cyber-attack that transpired in January 2022. This operation, which took nearly six years to conclude, led to the Justice Department obtaining 94,643 bitcoins. In a similar vein, 51,326 bitcoins were acquired in the seizure involving James Zhong in March 2022. Furthermore, the government managed to confiscate 69,369 bitcoins as a result of the notorious shutdown of the online drug marketplace Silk Road in November 2020.



It's worth noting that these assets are primarily stored offline in encrypted storage devices, which are safeguarded by the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service.



Periodically, Washington chooses to divest some of the seized bitcoins through auctions based on court-issued liquidation orders. One of the most significant sales took place in 2014 when billionaire Tim Draper acquired 30,000 of these tokens from government auctions.



Nevertheless, in recent years, the government has opted to sell the seized cryptocurrency assets through exchanges.

October 20, 2023 by David Edwards Leave a Comment

In the dynamic landscape of the digital economy, cryptocurrencies have emerged as a revolutionary force.

Spearheaded by the pioneering Immediate Definity 360 which is an Online trading platform, these alternative coins have sparked global interest in decentralized financial systems.

As the initial excitement around cryptocurrencies gives way to regulatory scrutiny, the need to establish robust legal frameworks for alternative coins becomes increasingly evident.

This article delves into the intricacies of regulating alternative coins and the significance of crafting effective legal structures in the aftermath of the Bitcoin age.

Embracing the Evolution: A Historical Glimpse The Rise of Bitcoin and Its Impact

The inception of Bitcoin in 2009 marked the beginning of a new era in finance. Operating on blockchain technology, Bitcoin aimed to provide an alternative to traditional fiat currencies.

Its decentralized nature and limited supply captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts and investors alike.

However, the lack of regulatory clarity led to concerns about its potential misuse, including illicit activities.

Proliferation of Alternative Coins

In the wake of Bitcoin's success, numerous alternative coins, often referred to as altcoins, emerged. Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and a plethora of other cryptocurrencies followed suit, each offering unique features and functionalities.

The diversification of the crypto market necessitated a more comprehensive regulatory approach, as regulators grappled with classifying and understanding these innovative digital assets.

The Regulatory Challenge: Navigating Uncharted Waters Classifying Cryptocurrencies: Commodity or Security?

One of the foremost challenges in crafting legal structures for alternative coins lies in their classification.

Are these digital assets commodities, subject to regulation by entities like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), or are they securities under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?

The answer often hinges on the specific characteristics and utility of the coin in question.

Balancing Innovation and Investor Protection

The heart of the regulatory challenge is striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding investor interests. Overly stringent regulations could stifle technological advancement, driving innovators away from the market.

Conversely, lax regulations might expose investors to fraudulent schemes and scams. Crafting legal structures that promote transparency, accountability, and fair practices is crucial to sustaining a healthy crypto ecosystem.

Regulatory Approaches: A Global Perspective Divergent Strategies Across Jurisdictions

The global nature of cryptocurrencies has prompted diverse regulatory responses from different countries. Some nations, like Japan, have embraced cryptocurrencies, recognizing them as legal tender.

Others, such as China, have imposed stringent bans on cryptocurrency trading. Meanwhile, jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union are working to develop comprehensive regulatory frameworks that balance innovation and oversight.

Sandboxes and Innovation Hubs

In recognition of the complexities involved, some countries have established regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs.

These environments allow startups and blockchain projects to operate under controlled conditions, enabling regulators to better understand the technology while providing innovators the space to develop their solutions.

This approach fosters collaboration between regulators and the crypto industry, leading to more informed and effective regulations.

Building the Future: Key Considerations for Regulation Interdisciplinary Collaboration

The multifaceted nature of cryptocurrencies calls for collaboration among various stakeholders. Legal experts, technologists, economists, and policymakers must work together to create holistic regulations that address the unique challenges posed by alternative coins.

Such collaboration ensures that regulations are not only effective but also adaptable to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Regulatory Sandboxes as Learning Grounds

Regulatory sandboxes have proven to be valuable tools for understanding the practical implications of different regulatory approaches.

By allowing crypto projects to operate in a controlled environment, regulators gain insights into how their policies impact the industry. This iterative process leads to the development of more refined and efficient regulations over time.

Conclusion: Forging Ahead in the Digital Frontier

In the wake of the Bitcoin age, the world stands at the crossroads of technological innovation and regulatory adaptation. As alternative coins continue to reshape the financial landscape, crafting legal structures that foster growth, innovation, and investor protection is paramount.

The evolution of cryptocurrencies is ongoing, and the regulatory journey is a collaborative effort that involves not only governments but also the broader crypto community.

By embracing this challenge with an open mind and a commitment to balance, we can pave the way for a sustainable and prosperous digital economy.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/20/R&AN_5c0f8image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,7.2861133,271b07d0a7c757b35a2ecc213f8aeeb8

This paper aims to reveal the asymmetric co-integration relationship and asymmetric causality between Bitcoin and global financial assets, namely gold, crude oil and the US dollar, and make a comparison for their asymmetric relationship before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Empirical results show that there is no linear co-integration relationship between Bitcoin and global financial assets, but there are nonlinear co-integration relationships. There is an asymmetric co-integration relationship between the rise in Bitcoin prices and the decline in the US Dollar Index (USDX), and there is a nonlinear co-integration relationship between the decline of Bitcoin and the rise and decline in the prices of the three financial assets. To be specific, there is a Granger causality between Bitcoin and crude oil, but not between Bitcoin and gold/US dollar. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an Asymmetric Granger causality between the decline in gold prices and the rise in Bitcoin prices. After the outbreak of the pandemic, there is an asymmetric Granger causality between the decline in crude oil prices and the decline in Bitcoin prices. The COVID-19 epidemic has led to changes in the causality between Bitcoin and global financial assets. However, there is not a linear Granger causality between the US dollar and Bitcoin. Last, the practical implications of the findings are discussed here.

Bitcoin, as well as traditional gold, crude oil, and the US dollar, are globally important financial assets that have received widespread attention from financial investors, financial institutions, and economists (
Li et al. 2021
). It seems that Bitcoin is more sought after by investors as a new financial asset. Bitcoin is favored due to its independence from central banks, with its value dependent on scarcity and mining costs (
Dyhrberg 2016a
; 
Abdullah and Mutawa 2023
). As it were, Bitcoin is a product of the distrust and uncertainty in the existing financial system. With the opening of the Bitcoin market, its trading volume and value have been increased, attracting more investors and financial institutions. Bitcoin has similar characteristics to gold, and many scholars believe that Bitcoin is also a safe-haven asset (
Long et al. 2021
). As a result, Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold (
Selmi et al. 2018
).
In recent years, scholars have studied Bitcoin from many aspects, such as the hedging ability of Bitcoin (
Wei et al. 2023
; 
Madichie et al. 2023
; 
Wang et al. 2019
), factors influencing Bitcoin price (
Bouoiyour and Selmi 2015
), Bitcoin price predictions (
Zhu et al. 2023
; 
Chen 2023
; 
Detzel et al. 2021
), and spillover effect of Bitcoin (
Fasanya et al. 2021
). Although Bitcoin is a new investment product, it brings substantial investment returns. The price of Bitcoin fell below USD 5000 in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, but by November 2021, it almost reached USD 65,000 (
Long et al. 2021
). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bitcoin market is significant (
Khan et al. 2023
). The COVID-19 pandemic and Bitcoin not only had a positive correlation, but also caused the rise of Bitcoin (
Goodell and Goutte 2021
). A few studies showed that Bitcoin, stock markets, and the global financial assets had different volatility and co-movement during the COVID-19 pandemic (
Abdul-Rahim et al. 2022
; 
Chan et al. 2023
). This shows that Bitcoin has become a very popular investment asset. High returns inevitably come with high risks. More Bitcoin investors are paying attention to the relationship between Bitcoin and global financial assets, namely gold, crude oil, and the US dollar. Among them, gold has long been considered a safe-haven asset (
Cunado et al. 2019
). Crude oil is also commonly used to hedge against the risks brought by the rise in commodity financialization (
Chen et al. 2018
; 
Tang and Xiong 2012
). And the US dollar is a store of value. Studying the relationships between Bitcoin and global financial assets helps diversify the investment risk of Bitcoin and ensure return on investment.
The purpose of this paper is to examine whether there is a co-integration relationship, especially asymmetric co-integration, between Bitcoin and global financial assets, namely gold, crude oil, and the US dollar. Through co-integration analysis, the causality, particularly asymmetric causality, between Bitcoin and global financial assets is further determined. The other objective of this study is to investigate whether the co-integration relationship and causality changes before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings of this study will help investors and financial institutions understand the relationships between Bitcoin and gold, crude oil, and the US dollar, providing valuable insights for Bitcoin investment decision making and risk management.
The reminder of this study is as follows: 
Section 2
 is a literature review that evaluates the relevant studies on Bitcoin and gold, Bitcoin and crude oil, and Bitcoin and the US dollar. 
Section 3
 provides a detailed description of the data. 
Section 4
 introduces the asymmetric co-integration test and asymmetric Granger causality test. 
Section 5
 demonstrates the empirical results and discussions, and 
Section 6
 draws a conclusion.
Bitcoin, being an emerging asset and having some similar properties to gold, is often referred to as 'digital gold' or 'Gold 2.0' (
Baur and Hoang 2021
; 
Jareño et al. 2020
). Consequently, many scholars have paid particular attention to the correlation and differences between Bitcoin and gold. 
Dyhrberg
 (
2016b
) found that Bitcoin and gold exhibit similar hedging features. Some scholars hold an opinion that there is a strong correlation between Bitcoin and gold (
Shahzad et al. 2019
; 
Bouoiyour et al. 2019
). Likewise, 
Selmi et al.
 (
2018
) and 
Shahzad et al.
 (
2021
) further identified Bitcoin and gold as safe-haven assets, especially during periods of economic instability. However, there are opposing views as well. For instance, 
Long et al.
 (
2021
) and 
Baur et al.
 (
2018
) found that Bitcoin does not have the same hedging properties as gold. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold is weak (
Kang et al. 2019
; 
Wu et al. 2019
). 
Al-Khazali et al.
 (
2018
) even claimed that Bitcoin and gold are independent. 
Ibrahim and Ali Basah
 (
2022
) found that there is no Granger causality between gold and Bitcoin. Moreover, scholars have also focused on the spillover effect between Bitcoin and gold (
Yu et al. 2021
; 
Aliu et al. 2023
), dynamic linear correlations (
Kang et al. 2019
; 
Jin et al. 2019
; 
Klein et al. 2018
), and nonlinear correlations (
Jareño et al. 2020
; 
Zwick and Syed 2019
; 
Kim et al. 2020
; 
Kumar et al. 2023
).
There is a natural positive correlation between Bitcoin and crude oil due to the fact that Bitcoin mining requires the consumption of crude oil (
Das et al. 2020
). The rise in crude oil prices may lead to inflationary pressure, resulting in the depreciation of fiat currencies. The depreciation of fiat currencies implies an increase in the demand for Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in Bitcoin prices (
Kilian 2009
). Recently, 
Wang et al.
 (
2022
) and 
Hsu et al.
 (
2023
) also revealed the positive correlation between crude oil and Bitcoin. Given this, scholars have been focused on the study of the relationship between Bitcoin and crude oil. Some scholars, such as the authors of 
Hsu et al.
 (
2023
); 
Li et al.
 (
2022
); 
Su and Li
 (
2020
); 
Zha et al.
 (
2023
), investigated the risk spillover effect and transmission path of Bitcoin, crude oil, and other financial assets. Some pay attention to the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and crude oil and their volatility (
Attarzadeh and Balcilar 2022
; 
Ozturk 2020
).
Apart from gold and crude oil, the US dollar is the asset that Bitcoin investors are most concerned about. A significant number of scholars have focused on the correlation between Bitcoin, gold, crude oil and the US dollar. For instance, 
Cao and Ling
 (
2022
) examined the asymmetric dependence structure of Bitcoin, the US dollar, and gold. 
Das et al.
 (
2020
) revealed the hedging and safe-haven properties of Bitcoin against crude oil, and compared it with gold and the US dollar. 
Dyhrberg
 (
2016a
) compared the volatility of Bitcoin, gold, and the US dollar, highlighting their roles in investment portfolios and risk management. Bhuiyan et al. 
Bhuiyan et al.
 (
2021
) revealed the lead–lag relationship between Bitcoin, crude oil, gold, and the US dollar, interpreting it as a causality. There are also studies that focus solely on the relationship between Bitcoin and the US dollar. For instance, 
Szetela et al.
 (
2016
) assessed the interdependence between Bitcoin and multiple currencies, including the US dollar. 
Antoniadis et al.
 (
2018
) and 
Ciaian et al.
 (
2016
) examined the impact of Bitcoin on the USDX, highlighting the asymmetric relationship between Bitcoin and the US dollar. 
Mokni and Ajmi
 (
2021
) compared the extremum Granger causality between cryptocurrencies and the US dollar before and after the pandemic.
The research on Bitcoin and the global financial assets is extensive, laying a solid foundation for this study. In spite of the abundant literature studying Bitcoin, we believe there are still questions that deserve further exploration. First, many studies have inconsistent findings, and ways in which the relationship between Bitcoin and the global financial assets changes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic are open to discussion. Second, many scholars have examined the hedging and safe-haven properties of Bitcoin, as well as the asymmetric risk spillover effect, while less attention has been paid to the long-term relationship between Bitcoin and the global financial assets. Third, only a few scholars have looked into the causality between Bitcoin and the US dollar or crude oil, without comprehensively determining the asymmetric causality between Bitcoin and the global financial assets. Therefore, it is necessary to study the asymmetric co-integration relationship and asymmetric causality between Bitcoin and the global financial assets, namely gold, crude oil, and the US dollar.
The contributions of this study mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, the asymmetric co-integration relationship between Bitcoin and global financial assets was examined through comparing the views of 
Tadi and Kortchemski
 (
2021
) and 
Tiffani et al.
 (
2023
) on the co-integration relationship. It was proven that asymmetric co-integration relationships can reveal more economic phenomena: there is no co-integration relationship between Bitcoin and the global financial assets, but there is a significant asymmetric co-integration relationship. Second, the asymmetric causality between Bitcoin and the global financial assets was examined. It was found that there is the Granger causality between crude oil and Bitcoin, and between the negative impact of crude oil and Bitcoin price decline. Third, further comparison was made on the asymmetric Granger causality between Bitcoin and global financial assets before and after the COVID-19 outbreak while drawing on the practice of 
Mokni and Ajmi
 (
2021
). The results indicated that the decline in gold prices due to the pandemic is no longer a Granger cause of the rise in Bitcoin prices, but the decline in crude oil prices becomes a Granger cause of the decline in Bitcoin prices.
Data on Bitcoin, gold, crude oil and the USDX were sourced from Yahoo Finance. To ensure temporal alignment, we obtained weekly data from 1 January 2015 to 15 June 2023. 
Figure 1
, 
Figure 2
 and 
Figure 3
 depict the price trends of Bitcoin and the aforementioned three assets. As can be observed, the prices of Bitcoin and crude oil are highly volatile (
Phoong et al. 2020
), and there appears to be a certain correlation between their peaks and troughs, which may be a phenomenon revealed by causality. Comparatively speaking, the USDX shows the smallest fluctuations, followed by gold.
Following 
Lardic and Mignon

Bullish view

The BTC/USD pair continued rallying during the weekend as hopes of a spot Bitcoin ETF continued. Bitcoin surged to a multi-month high of $30,400, meaning it has jumped by more than $5,000 from the lowest level in September ETF hopes

Bitcoin surge is in contrast with what happened across other assets. American stocks have retreated, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 indices falling by more than 1% on Friday. Companies like Tesla and Tesla have crashed by double-digits from their highest level this year.

At the same time, the bond market has come under intense strain as the 10-year and 30-year have jumped to 4.91% and 5.07%, their highest levels in over two decades. Bond yields jump when prices are retreating.

American bonds have plunged as the Federal Reserve continues its tightening and as the budget deficit widens. Data published last week showed that the deficit jumped to $1.7 trillion, up by 27% from a year earlier. This deficit widened as government spending rose and tax receipts fell.

Bitcoin's jump has also mirrored that of gold, which is often seen as a safe haven. After falling to $1,800 in August, gold has jumped to almost $2,000 as demand from central banks rise.

The main catalyst for Bitcoin is the ongoing hopes of a Bitcoin ETF. In a statement last week, Gary Gensler said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was still reviewing the most recent applications.

Analysts at JPMorgan said that they believe that the SEC will approve the ETFs in the coming months. Therefore, hopes are that the price will continue rising ahead of the ETF launch and then retreat as traders sell the news/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has been in a strong bullish trend after bottoming in September. As it rose, Bitcoin has moved above important resistance levels like 28,628, the highest swing on October 2nd. It is now sitting at the important resistance level at 30,000, which is a crucial psychological point.

Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-period moving average, signaling that buyers are in control. At the same time, the volume has moved downwards while the two lines of the MACD have formed a bearish crossover.

Therefore, Bitcoin will likely retreat slightly in the near term as investors start taking profits. Alternatively, it will remain in this range as traders wait for the next ETF news.

Bearish view

Bitcoin's remarkable rally gained steam this week as investors remained optimistic about the crypto industry. The BTC/USD pair crossed the crucial resistance level of 35,000 for the first time since May 2022. It has jumped by over 35% from its lowest point in September.

Bitcoin demand continues

The BTC/USD pair continued surging as investors remained optimistic about the upcoming Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. Several large companies like Blackrock, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and Ark Invest have all filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In a statement last week, SEC chair said that the agency was still studying the ETFs. Analysts believe that this approval will happen in the next few weeks or months. The implication of all this is that institutional investors will likely allocate some of their funds to a BTC ETF.

Bitcoin has also risen because of the overall flight to safety as risks in the financial market rises. US budget deficit has jumped to almost $2 trillion while the cost to service the debt has jumped to over $800 billion.

There are also risks that high inflation is here to stay now that the price of crude oil is stuck at $90. As the war between Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah continues, there is a likelihood that it will soar to over $100 soon.

Bitcoin's surge has also corresponded with the performance of gold. After falling to $1,800 earlier this month, gold has jumped to almost $2,000. Gold is often seen as a safe haven in periods of risk while many investors view Bitcoin as a digital gold/USD technical analysis

The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price formed a double-bottom pattern at $24,801 on June 15th and September 11th. It has now bounced back and moved above the psychological levels at 30,000 and 35,000.

Bitcoin has also jumped above the 50-day and 25-day moving averages, pointing to the strength of bulls. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved to the extreme overbought point of 85.

Therefore, based on the trend-following approach, the outlook for the pair is bullish, with the next target being the psychological level at 36,000. A move above that level will open the possibility for the pair soaring to 40,000. The alternative is where the coin pulls back as investors start taking profits.

Bitcoin has been one of the best-performing assets this week as demand for the coin rises. The BTC/USD pair surged to a high of 35,133 on Tuesday, the highest level since May 2022. It has surged by over 117% from the lowest level this year. In contrast, other assets like gold and stocks have risen by much less surge continues

Bitcoin has rallied in the past few days as investors remained hopeful that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve ETFs by leading companies like Blackrock, Invesco, Ark Invest, and Franklin Templeton.

Analysts believe that the SEC will approve all these ETFs together. As a result, these companies will need to buy as many Bitcoins as possible to fulfill demand from institutional investors.

There is speculation that some of these companies have started buying Bitcoin already. For example, Blackrock's ETF proposal said that the company would start buying the coins by the end of October.

Also, the approval of the ETF will validate Bitcoin as an established asset class along others like gold and silver.

Bitcoin's performance has stunned many crypto bears. It comes a year after Terra's collapse, which led to the demise of companies like Voyager Digital, Celsius, and Three Arrows Capital.

In November, FTX, then the second-biggest cryptocurrency collapsed, leading to billions of dollars in losses. This collapse pushed more people to exit the crypto industry as concern about safety continued.

Bitcoin has also risen after a series of legal wins. Ripple Labs won a major lawsuit against the SEC in which the regulator called XRP a financial security. Recently, Grayscale won a lawsuit that compelled the SEC to review its plan to convert GBTC Trust into an ETF/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few days. This surge saw it rally from last month's low of $24,800 to over $35,000. On the daily chart, Bitcoin has risen above the important resistance at $31,906, the previous YTD high.

The BTC/USD pair has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Arnaud Legoux Moving Averages (ALMA). It has also moved above the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Therefore, there is a possibility that the uptrend will continue as buyers target the next resistance point at 37,000.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as apin bar , adoji , an outside or even just anengulfing candlewith a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previousBTC/USDanalysis that there could be a good short trade entry opportunity due to the medium-term bearish trend. In fact, there was little volatility that day, and none of my key levels were reached.

The technical picture has become much more bullish over the past two weeks, especially over the past few days, with the strong, fast rise to the $35k upon rumours that the first Bitcoin ETF was close to gaining approval. This has not become reality yet, but it is enough to keep the price testing the $35k area.

However, bulls are so far failing to break above the $35k level, which looks pivotal, and we have seen a bearishdouble top chart patternforming from these rejections.

I think the next thing to watch is whether the support levels at $34,281 or $33,445 continue to hold. Bullish bounces at these levels could be good long trade entries, but if the price gets established below $33,445 it could fall far quite quickly.

As the price has risen strongly to make new multi-month highs, Bitcoin could be very attractive to trend traders on the long side. Conservative traders might want to wait for a bullish daily close above $35k before entering.

Concerning the US Dollar, there will be a release of US Advance GDP data and Unemployment Claims data at 1:30pm London time.

460,It's the Best Time of Year for Bitcoin Prices,Brenden Rearick,2023-10-27 00:00:00,date,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/money/bitcoin-price-best-time-of-year,charlotteobserver.com,"Bitcoin prices have doubled already in 2023, and we're entering a time of year when major spikes have happened.","Bitcoin prices have doubled already in 2023, and we're entering a time of year when major spikes have happened.

After a rough year for cryptocurrency prices (and investing in general), bitcoin has been clawing its way back up. Prices for the most famous cryptocurrency have risen from $16,625 in January all the way to over $34,000 in October, including an increase of around 30% over the past month. And now we are entering a time when it seems like bitcoin has historically performed the strongest.

The crypto asset's price has often seen significant spikes in the fourth quarter of the year, suggesting a seasonal trend for bitcoin prices. In 2016, for example, bitcoin gained 63% from the beginning of October to the end of December. In 2017, it gained 267% in that same time frame. In fact, between 2016 and 2021, the crypto has gained an average of 25% in October, 8% in November and 11% in December, according to data by investing research company Bespoke Investing Group.

This gives a lot of hope for investors that bitcoin can add onto its recent surge. But no one can accurately predict where volatile investments like crypto are headed at any given time, and some experts question whether there's any truth to the theory that bitcoin prices often get a bump toward the end of the year.

Do bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year?

The numbers indicate that the fourth quarter has been historically favorable for bitcoin prices. But experts have not come to a consensus on why or even if bitcoin prices often surge in the fall.

A popular theory is that crypto buyers, just like stock investors, are apt to trade heavily toward the end of the calendar year. Bitwise Asset Management's chief investment officer, Matthew Hougan, previously told Money that while investors are looking to strategize their portfolios for the year's end, lots of money has tended to end up in crypto allocations.

Others say it's just too early to draw any conclusions about bitcoin pricing trends. Omid Malekan, crypto expert and adjunct professor at Columbia University's Business School, tells Money that he's 'not certain if bitcoin has a strong seasonal trend or if it's coincidental.'

Crypto may be over a decade old, but it's still infantile compared to other assets like stocks or bonds. This lack of sufficient data, Malekan says, makes it difficult to assess the validity of any crypto trends.

Malekan says bitcoin is defined by 'eras' perhaps more so than seasonal trends. 'The last bull market and crash were driven by central bank liquidity and fears about inflation and the resulting monetary tightening,' he says. These eras are not seasonal trends that hold up over time, but rather shorter-lived events driven by investor behavior.

Do bitcoin prices and stocks rise and fall together?

But wait, don't stocks often rise in the fourth quarter as well? That's true. As it turns out, bitcoin prices and stocks are likely more linked than you might expect. And this relationship could be what gives some credence to the idea of bitcoin price seasonality.

In February, researchers at Georgetown University discovered that a correlation between cryptocurrency prices and the stock market continues to grow stronger. Specifically, they find that price movement of bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index are correlated, and continue to become more so. They said that the linkage 'may reflect the fact that the two markets are becoming more connected, as institutional investors increasingly enter the crypto world.'

While the reasons why the two investments follow the same price patterns aren't totally understood yet, it would make sense that crypto is prone to the same kind of selloffs that happen in the stock market.

If this is true, then there is reason to believe that bitcoin prices tend to rise at the end of the year at least partly because stocks also frequently rise at the end of the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted an average gain of 4.2% in the last quarter of the year. That's twice as good as the next best-performing first quarter, which averages a return of 2.1%. And just like how September is typically a bad month for bitcoin prices, it is also historically one of the worst months for stock performance.

Where are bitcoin prices heading now?

If the theory that bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year holds true, the crypto could continue its recent hot run. However, as the saying goes: Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Last year, the coin dropped by 12.3% over the course of the fourth quarter. Of course, bitcoin's 2022 was marked by losses throughout the entirety of the year, with the crypto losing 66% over 12 months. In retrospect, banking on a strong end of the year in 2022 would have proved foolish. Ultimately, the October-December period was bitcoin's second-worst quarter in 2022.

With wind behind bitcoin's sails this year, though, as well as building excitement over likely upcoming changes in crypto investing options, many experts have voiced bullish predictions for the near term.

'We're one step closer to a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors are optimistic that an approval could happen fairly soon,' says Anthony Georgiades, general partner at investing fund Innovation Capital. 'There's also much anticipation about the next bitcoin halving, which typically serves as a catalyst for bull markets.'

A bitcoin ETF is an investment fund made up of bitcoin or bitcoin-related companies. Right now, bitcoin ETFs only consist of futures contracts, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. Investing companies Fidelity and BlackRock are both waiting for approval for their spot bitcoin ETFs, which would be the first ETFs to contain bitcoin itself. Bitcoin halving, meanwhile, is a process in which the rate at which coins are released is cut in half; it happens every four years, and the next halving is expected in spring of 2024.

Others say that the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 2024 is also driving optimism. Zachary Townsend, CEO of crypto company Meanwhile, says 'the cost of servicing the existing and new debt will simply be too high' for the Fed to avoid cutting its rates.

One consequence of this, Townsend says, is 'debasement of the currency,' or a drop in value of the U.S. dollar. 'It's in these kinds of environments in particular, when fiat currency is getting debased, that bitcoin performs best.'",,2295,news,US,en,Brenden Rearick,https://rs.moneyresearchcollective.com/wp-assets/apwp/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/27100103/media-temp-e8-YWoAOPORPmLSR4QNciA20231027-6128-1332aq8-scaled.jpg,False,,8.731625,0c5f8afaa99878e23507f4cd9906bdc2

463,Developments In Spot Bitcoin ETF Brought $66 Million To The Crypto,MENAFN,2023-10-26 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107311633/Developments-In-Spot-Bitcoin-ETF-Brought-66-Million-To-The-Crypto,menafn.com,"Discussions around the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) heated up in the last days of October, benefiting not altcoins but Bitcoin.","(MENAFN- B2Press) Discussions around the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) heated up in the last days of October, benefiting not altcoins but Bitcoin. Approximately 84% of new crypto investments were made in Bitcoin.

TURKEY - The week of October 23 started quickly for cryptocurrencies. Rising expectations that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications from mid-October brought a new surge as the end of October approached. On October 24, Bitcoin tested its highest level in 18 months, reaching $35,000. Kafkas Sönmez, Global Growth Director of the global cryptocurrency exchange Gate, evaluated the latest developments in the cryptocurrency markets.

The weekly market report published by the digital asset investment strategies company CoinShares indicates an increase in managed assets and a weekly entry of $66 million into the crypto markets. The report notes that Bitcoin ETF developments have elevated investments in digital currencies for the fourth consecutive week.

Kafkas Sönmez, stating that Bitcoin has taken a leading role in the new asset flows towards the cryptocurrency markets, said, ""According to the report, Bitcoin showed significant growth, with approximately 83.7% asset inflow compared to previous weeks. Of the $66 million, $55 million flowed into Bitcoin. When we look at the historical perspective of Bitcoin's price, we can say that the cryptocurrency has doubled since reaching its bottom at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. Especially, the legal victories of Grayscale and Ripple that we witnessed in recent weeks had a significant impact on these developments.'

Kafkas Sönmez, stating that signals of the rise in Bitcoin began to be seen in recent weeks, said, ""In the previous week, Bitcoin tested above $30,000 twice within the same week. Moreover, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, highlighted in his speech at the New York Economic Club that inflation is still running very high and signalled the possibility of new interest rate hikes in the coming period. Although this situation caused minor pullbacks in U.S. stocks, Bitcoin experienced one of its most resilient months in October. This resilience is also reflected in other cryptocurrencies; for instance, there was a net inflow of $15.5 million into Solana in the past 4 weeks.'

Gate Global Growth Director Kafkas Sönmez, emphasizing that the institutional interest in crypto has led financial authorities to be more open-minded about digital assets, concluded his assessments with the following statement: ""Those interested in the cryptocurrency markets are closely monitoring the latest developments and reacting very quickly. We see that the market is pricing in Bitcoin ETF from the recent surge, believed to be associated with Bitcoin ETF. A wider audience understands the potential growth of digital currencies, and the positive responses shown by the market to this flexibility are becoming concrete in the figures. As Gate Turkey, offering secure transactions 24/7 for over 1,400 cryptocurrencies, we continue to monitor the market in real-time and introduce investors of all levels to the possibilities of crypto and Web3.""

The largest digital asset experienced a substantial increase, surging by as much as 11.5 percent to surpass USD35,000. It was trading at USD34,800 as of 10:31 AM in Singapore on Tuesday, marking a year-to-date rebound of over 100 percent from the digital asset downturn in 2022.



One of the primary factors fueling this surge is the anticipation of the potential approval of the first US spot Bitcoin ETFs in the coming weeks. This prospect has ignited speculative interest in the cryptocurrency. Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, are actively competing to introduce such ETF products. Supporters of digital assets argue that ETFs would significantly expand the adoption of Bitcoin.



On Monday, a US federal appeals court formalized a legal victory for Grayscale Investments in its pursuit of establishing a spot Bitcoin ETF, despite objections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has been cautious about permitting ETFs that directly invest in Bitcoin, citing concerns about risks such as fraud and market manipulation. The applications submitted by prominent investment firms have generated speculation that the regulatory agency may reconsider its stance.



Furthermore, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that the iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation with the ticker ""USDIBTC."" Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, operates the iShares business, while the DTCC is responsible for clearing and settlement processes in US markets.



In summary, Bitcoin's surge to its highest price in over a year is closely tied to the growing anticipation of US spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining regulatory approval. These ETFs have garnered significant attention and are expected to contribute to the wider adoption of the cryptocurrency, marking a pivotal development in the digital asset space.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_31.jpg,False,@menafn,7.563214,4448f4f182227c7a209b4e6927e99cc0

It's up 20 per cent over the past five days, a media report said.

The famously volatile cryptocurrency has more than doubled in value this year as investors grow excited about the prospect of being able to buy bitcoin funds that trade on good old-fashioned stock exchanges rather than having to deal with less-regulated and sometimes sketchy crypto platforms, CNN reported.

BlackRock applied in June to register a bitcoin spot ETF, which is pending approval. The company is the largest provider of ETFs in the world, managing trillions of dollars of assets. A BlackRock bitcoin ETF would give the cryptocurrency a new sense of legitimacy.

'This listing in the DTCC does not mean that the fund has actually been launched or that this will inevitably happen,' said Samer Hasn, market analyst at online brokerage XS.

'However, it may appear as part of BlackRock's preparations to launch the ETF soon,' Hasn said, CNN reported.

Other companies have also applied for approval to launch similar bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale Investments.

There's another reason why bitcoin may be rising: Fear.

As investors look to diversify their portfolios in uncertain times, some turn to bitcoin, ironically as a kind of digital safe haven. Sometimes dubbed'digital gold"", bitcoin has become a way for investors to branch out beyond traditional stocks and bonds, CNN reported.

This paper reports our findings on the return dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum using high-frequency data (minute-by-minute observations) from 2015 to 2022 for Bitcoin and from 2016 to 2022 for Ethereum. The main objective of modeling these two series was to obtain a dynamic estimation of risk premium with the intention of characterizing its behavior. To this end, we estimated the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity in Mean with Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution (GARCH-M-NIG) model for the residuals. We also estimated the other parameters of the model and discussed their evolution over time, including the skewness and kurtosis of the Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution. Similarly, we determined the parameters that define the evolution of the estimated variance, i.e., the parameters related to the fitted past variance, square error and long-term average value. We found that, despite the market uncertainty during the COVID-19 emergency period (2020 and 2021), the selected cryptocurrencies' return volatility and kurtosis were even greater for several other subperiods within our sample's time frame. Our model represents an analytical tool that estimates the risk premium that should be delivered by Bitcoin and Ethereum and is therefore of interest to risk managers, traders and investors.


 










 


The sanitary emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic induced much turbulence in most economic sectors and, naturally, in the financial markets. Its effects during 2020 and 2021 were significantly greater than those of the financial crisis of 2008 [
1
,
2
,
3
]. From an economic point of view, the two most significant consequences were high global inflation rates during 2022 (resulting from a complex combination of supply constrains in the product and labor markets and economic agents' expectations) and the aggressive anti-recessionary policies implemented by many countries. In February 2022, inflation levels in the United States were recorded to be at a historical maximum of 7.9% (their highest in 20 years). Business and consumption worldwide were impacted, and the global economy underwent negative growth. For example, the US GDP saw a reduction of 19.2% between the last quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020, with the unemployment rate reaching 14.7% in April 2020, its highest level since 1948; this represented 23.1 million people without jobs. Between March 21st and July 18th 2020, 52.7 million citizens applied for unemployment insurance [
4
]. As an example of extraordinary anti-recessionary policies, the monetary measures taken by the United States government and its central bank represented an almost six trillion-dollar injection of money to the economy, and the reference interest rate dropped to almost zero.
Financial markets experienced their worse crash since the 2008–2009 turmoil. With huge transfers of money from the stock market to treasury bonds, the stock market's upward trend that had lasted since 2009 finally ended. The turning point can be identified as March 2020, when the sanitary emergency and its associated constraints hit the market. However, significant recovery was observed during the second quarter of 2020, a period in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ increased by 18%, 20% and 31%, respectively [
5
].
The behavior of the cryptocurrency market was significantly different, which requires some explanation. Cryptocurrency trading is supported by Blockchain technology, a platform with the following distinctive characteristics:
(1)
There are no financial intermediaries, i.e., there is no middleman between buyers and sellers. It is a peer-to-peer technology, according to Harwick [
6
] and Dwyer [
7
].
(2)
It is decentralized and the government cannot control it, at least theoretically, as proposed by Dwyer [
7
] and Rose [
8
].
(3)
In terms of security, if the network has a problematic area, the non-affected areas can review the whole transaction flow with no problem. This is an important characteristic of Blockchain technology.
(4)
It is almost anonymous in its operation, Fang et al. [
9
].
(5)
It is open for operation 24 h, 7 days a week.
Since the introduction of Bitcoin and until December 2019, approximately 4950 cryptocurrencies were created (see Fang et al. [
9
]), and their market capitalization value was around 190 billion dollars in 2019. Bitcoin and Ethereum were the most important that year in terms of their market capitalization, representing 64% of the total in March [
10
].
Financial security time-varying risk premium estimation was introduced by Engle et al. [
11
], and led to a vast number of papers being published on this topic in the following decades. Authors who have analyzed the risk/return relationship using high-frequency data include Baron et al. [
12
], who use a sample of the leading Swedish equity index, the OMX S30; Almeida et al. [
13
], who study the S&P 500's futures returns; and Ji [
14
], who works with the Shanghai 50. Breckenfelder [
15
] presents an interesting theoretical discussion on the tradeoff between risk and return using high-frequency data.
In this paper, we study the time dynamics of risk premium for Bitcoin and Ethereum during the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 periods, using high-frequency data (minute-by-minute). A GARCH(1,1)-M-NIG model with 1440 daily observations was used because its parameters can be interpreted as an asset's risk premium. To achieve improved adjustment, the residuals were modeled with a semi-heavy-tail distribution (Normal-Inverse Gaussian). This approach enables the observation of the model's parameters throughout the observation period. Modeling the risk premium permits monitoring the behavior of Bitcoin and Ethereum to support investors in their decision making.
We hypothesized that the parameters of our model would show important variations during the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subperiods. We found that the former subperiod was not associated with the largest observed volatility during the analysis. The risk premium parameter varied considerably in subperiods that were different from the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subperiods. These variations were associated with time series bias and kurtosis, which, in addition to conveying valuable information for risk management (since we worked with intraday data), allowed us to better understand the behavior of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate the existence of a relationship between price bubble episodes and exuberant behavior in the skewness and kurtosis of the returns distribution. The daily estimation of the model's parameters supports finer calibration for risk managers and portfolio managers.
The interpretation of the GARCH model is straightforward and provides dynamic updates for supporting risk-management decisions. The variations in the parameters—which are random by nature—allow the dynamic behavior to be described with more precision to support decision making, especially when there are important variations. In contrast to other studies of high-frequency data (e.g., Pele et al. [
16
], Louzis [
17
], Degiannakis [
18
], Giot [
19
], Dionne [
20
] and Beltratti [
21
]), we present a model that explicitly shows the dynamic evolution of risk premium, not just the returns and volatility typically modeled by the GARCH Family models. While Gyamerah [
22
] uses the NIG distribution for residuals, they do not review the parameters of the distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the behaviors of the skewness '




ρ




' and shape '




ζ




' parameters are discussed using high-frequency data for Bitcoin and Ethereum. An additional contribution of this paper is that we developed GARCH-M-NIG modeling by day, i.e., we studied the evolution of the parameters with daily frequency, which was possible thanks to minute-by-minute data availability. The COVID-19 period did not show the largest variability during the period of study. Instead, the observed market bubbles of the previous year represented the period with the highest variance. This was reflected in the 2019 risk premium parameter.
This work provides a better understanding of the variability of Bitcoin and Ethereum by modeling their returns and volatility. The reported findings are expected to provide support for improving investments and risk management practices.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2
 presents a literature review; 
Section 3
 discusses the methodology used in our analysis; 
Section 4
 contains a description of the data and presents the estimation results; and 
Section 5
 concludes the paper.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the market and is currently the most important in its category; for these reasons, it has attracted a significant amount of of research attention. Studies of its returns' volatility have used GARCH-type models, as in Bariviera et al. [
23
], Katsiampa [
24
] and Troster et al. [
25
] (note: Charles [
26
] re-estimated Katsiampa's model using the same data and an extended observation set to find partially different results, and concluded that 'GARCH-type models characterized by short memory, asymmetric effects, or long-run and short-run movements, seem not to be appropriate for modeling the Bitcoin returns', contributing to a better understanding of this modeling technique).
Conrad [
27
] found that Bitcoin volatility has an inverse relationship with the volatility of the S&P500, and at the same time exhibits pro-cyclical behavior relative to the behavior of gold in periods of higher S&P500 volatility. In a related study, Al-Khazali et al. [
28
] discovered an asymmetric response between Bitcoin and gold volatility in the presence of positive or negative macroeconomic news.
Wen [
29
] demonstrated that Bitcoin is not a safe-haven asset, and Briere et al. [
30
] studies the possibilities that Bitcoin represents for portfolio diversification. Before the COVID-19 pandemic period, Feng et al. [
31
] proved the ability of Bitcoin and gold to achieve risk diversification.
For the period of 2014–2018, Kaya [
32
] used a family of GARCH models to discover the presence of long memory in the volatility of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple (which represented 86% of total market capitalization). A similar finding for Bitcoin was reported by Bouri et al. [
33
], and for seven other cryptocurrencies by Lahmiri et al. [
34
].
Long memory implies predictability, as demonstrated by Mensi et al. [
35
], in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a better risk–return tradeoff in portfolios, as established by Gil-Alana et al. [
36
], in the case of different financial indices.
Comparing volatilities, Liu et al. [
37
] showed that cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple) have greater volatility (with weekly and monthly frequencies) than stocks, and greater volatility than fiat money and metals (euro, UK pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, gold, platinum and silver).
Nie [
38
] studied the structure of changes in the correlation matrix of the top 100 cryptocurrencies according to their market capitalization and using Minimum Spanning Trees. The author addresses two main questions: 'do the correlation dynamics in the cryptocurrency market include critical events?' and 'is there synchronization between correlation dynamics and the structural dynamics of the correlation networks?'. Shi et al. [
39
] used a multi-factor stochastic volatility model to analyze the different correlations of twelve cryptocurrencies before the COVID-19 pandemic period.
In Chuffart [
40
], cryptocurrencies' conditional correlations were reported to have changed after the 2017 bubble burst, but other studies (e.g., Baur et al. [
41
]) report that Bitcoin has no correlation with other assets (bonds, commodities and stocks) during either normal or crisis periods. Similarly, with a panel with 300 cryptocurrencies, Bianchi [
42
] reported a weak relationship between the returns of cryptocurrencies and the returns of different commodities.
Cryptocurrencies are characterized by high and persistent volatility, as reported by Yaya et al. [
43
] in a study using twelve cryptocurrencies for the period of 2015–2018. Along the same lines, cryptocurrencies exhibit time-varying volatility and leverage effects, as reported by Catania et al. [
44
].
Several authors have stated that cryptocurrencies' market structure characteristics differed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Samut et al. [
45
] tested two alternative hypotheses on the correlation and causal relationship between the returns volatility and trading volume of financial assets, and found that the sequential information arrival hypothesis offered a more adequate description of the cryptocurrency market during the pre-pandemic period, but that during the pandemic period, the mixture of distribution hypothesis was more pertinent. By contrast, Goodell et al. [
46
] showed that movements of Bitcoin prices were related to the global number of deaths during the pandemic. Both studies reveal a changing market structure.
Several authors have tried GARCH modeling and forecasting cryptocurrencies' volatility. For example, Cheikh et al. [
47

Bitcoin price moved sideways on Tuesday even as investors moved to relatively risky assets. The BTC/USD pair was trading at 34,400, where it has been in the past few days. This price is a few points below the year-to-date high of 35,133. It has jumped by more than 122% from the lowest level this year rally eases

Bitcoin has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. The rally accelerated this month as hopes that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will accept a Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year.

Analysts believe that a spot BTC ETF will lead to more inflows from institutional investors in the coming months. This will be important since Bitcoin supply remains significantly lower.

At the same time, Bitcoin whales have continued accumulating the coin. MicroStrategy, the biggest Bitcoin whale, has bought coins worth over $4.8 billion. Further, the number of Bitcoin holders with over $100k coins have risen sharply in the past few weeks. The number stands at over 23, the highest point this year.

The next important catalyst for the BTC/USD pair will be the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Economists expect the Fed will deliver another hawkish pause. This happens when the bank leaves rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%.

The Fed will also point to another rate hike later this year if inflation remains stubbornly high. The decision will come at a time when bond yields have surged to the highest level in years. At the same time, data published by the statistics agency showed that the economy expanded by 4.9% in the third quarter/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. It managed to move above the important resistance point at 31,780, the highest point in July. The pair has also jumped above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages . The two have made a bullish crossover, which is commonly known as a golden cross.

Bitcoin has also formed a bullish flag pattern and is now nearing the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also formed an ascending triangle pattern. Therefore, the pair will likely continue rising as buyers target the 50% retracement point at 42,115.

Bitcoin and American stocks and bonds reacted positively to the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The BTC/USD pair remained above 34,600 on Thursday morning and is nearing the year-to-date high of 35,161. It has jumped by over 38% from the lowest level in September Reserve decision

The Federal Reserve , as widely expected, decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%. In its statement, the bank said that the American economy was holding strong despite the elevated interest rates.

The Fed also left the door open for another rate increase if inflation remains above the 2% target. In his press conference, Jerome Powell said that that the bank will remain data-dependent when determining the next rate decision.

The key data to watch ahead of the last meeting of the year will be two non-farm payrolls (NFP) and two consumer inflation data. The first of these reports will come out on Friday when the Fed will release the latest jobs numbers.

In addition to Bitcoin, stocks and bonds reacted positively to the Federal Reserve decision. The Dow Jones jumped by over 245 points while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices rose by 50 and 207, respectively.

The 10-year Treasury yield dropped by 2.44% to 4.76% while the 30-year moved below 5% for the first time this week. Bond yields move inversely to prices. At the same time, the yield curve narrowed to minus 15.8 while the US dollar index (DXY) dropped to $106.54.

There will be no macro event on Thursday. Therefore, traders will focus on the upcoming NFP data. On Wednesday, data by ADP revealed that the country's private sector created 113k jobs in October/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a narrow range in the past few days. On the 4H chart, the pair has moved above the 25-period and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages. It has also formed a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern is often a sign that the pre-existing trend will continue.

The pair has also moved above the Woodie pivot point. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also formed a bearish divergence pattern. In all, the outlook for the pair is bullish, with the next resistance point to watch being the psychological point at 36,000.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis that bulls had been failing to break above the $35,000 resistance level, which looked pivotal, so I thought that the next thing to watch was whether the support levels at $34,281 or $33,445 continued to hold. I paid particular attention to the lower level.

This was a good call as the support level at $33,445 has continued to hold, so although the price has remained below $35,000 over the past days, it is still holding up, and has not made a significant bearish breakdown.

Essentially, Bitcoin is stuck in a consolidation pattern between $33,445 and $35,000. One obvious way to play this will be to wait for a daily close above $35,000 for a long trade entry signal, or for a daily close below $33,445 for a short trade entry signal. A more aggressive approach would be to wait for two consecutive higher hourly closes above $35,000, or lower below $33,445.

The fundamental driver of Bitcoin's recent strength is the increased speculation that a retail Bitcoin ETF by Blackrock is close to securing regulatory approval. However, there is plenty of evidence that if this happens, it will not happen for several months yet at least, so this bullish push may be premature and could quickly fade away. Another factor is the absence of strong risk-on sentiment, which tends to depress the price of Bitcoin.

Therefore, I think the resistance at $35,000 is more likely to hold than to break.

There is nothing of high importance scheduled today concerning the US Dollar.

Bitcoin's price has risen strongly in recent weeks with the United States possibly set to allow a popular type of trading in the cryptocurrency that would further normalise the asset.

A 30-percent jump since the end of August has been driven by speculation around the creation of a so-called exchange-traded fund for the asset, which would directly track the price of bitcoin.

Spot bitcoin ETF would allow more of the general public to invest in the cryptocurrency without having to directly buy it.

""Approval is now (a matter of) when, not if,"" Charles Morris, founder of crypto analyst group ByteTree, told AFP.

With a market capitalisation of about $670 billion, bitcoin is the world's biggest cryptocurrency and has doubled in value since the start of the year.

Bitcoin's price briefly surpassed $35,000 last week -- helped also by some investors viewing the asset as a haven amid economic and geopolitical unrest.

But it remains around half its record value of almost $69,000 that was reached in late 2020.

""The rebound we are seeing... seems linked to a single catalyst: the enthusiasm generated by a possible approval"" of Spot bitcoin ETF, said Clara Medalie of cryptocurrency data analysts Kaiko.

Blackrock chief executive Larry Fink recently argued that part of the rally could be attributed to ""way beyond the rumour"".

He said it was also ""about a flight to quality, with all the issues around the Israeli war now, global terrorism"".

A federal appeals court in Washington last month upheld its decision that ruled in favour of asset manager Grayscale against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which had refused to authorise its bitcoin ETF.

The SEC is now re-examining the application, as well as looking at bitcoin ETF requests made by other financial groups, including BlackRock and Ark Invest.

The regulator's first decision is expected to be on Ark Invest, by January 10 at the latest.

- In gold's wake -

Morris believes SEC approval will set off a gradual push into bitcoin trades, similar to when an ETF for gold was approved at the start of the millennium.

Companies applying for a fund are helping to boost the cryptocurrency's price, since they are required to have a certain level of bitcoins before launch, according to Michael van de Poppe, founder of the MN Trading platform.

Felix Hartmann, managing partner at Hartmann Capital, told AFP that the present situation ""moves bitcoin further out of this esoteric asset class and more towards being recognised as a legitimate trustable asset"".

Central banks and regulators have long warned over the volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, especially in statements aimed at small investors.

- Rival cryptocurrencies -

Analysts believe rivals to bitcoin, notably ether, could also eventually have Spot ETFs attached.

Before then, Sui Chung, chief executive at CF Benchmarks, expects the SEC to approve several bitcoin ETFs at once, since the applications are similar.

""Once providers know what the benchmark is for approval, it could open the way for ETFs tracking other cryptocurrencies,"" he predicted.

His company is providing market data to seven bitcoin ETF applicants, including BlackRock.

Whatever the SEC decides on the exchange-traded funds, bitcoin's current price-recovery is a positive for cryptocurrency, a sector rocked by a series of bankruptcies and scandals in recent years.

Attention is also fixed firmly on the ongoing court trial of former crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried.

The 31-year-old has been charged with seven counts of fraud, embezzlement and criminal conspiracy and faces decades in prison if found guilty on all counts.

He witnessed his FTX empire's downfall, which followed a meteoric rise in which the platform became the world's second biggest crypto exchange -- making Bankman-Fried a tech-world billionaire sensation.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/01/AFP_1463aimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.342772,4810407d34ea30ca7067633d31935270

Based on traditional market theory, this study aims to investigate whether conventional market investment slopes affect the unconventional Bitcoin market, considering both normal conditions and crises. This study examines three main characteristics of the economy-intensive blockchain system, namely reliability, investment slopes, financial and accounting aspects that ultimately determine the confidence in the choice to invest in cryptocurrency. The analysis focuses on the study of the Bitcoin (BTC) investment slopes during January 2014–April 2023, considering the specifics of blockchain technology and the inferences of ethics, reliability and real-world data on investment Tassets in the context of conventional regulated markets. Using an econometric model that incorporates reliability analysis techniques, factorial comparisons and multinomial regression using economic crisis periods as a dummy variable, this study reveals important findings for practical and academic purposes. The results of this study show that the investment slopes of Bitcoin (BTC) are mostly predictable for downward trends, when statistically significant correlations with the investment slopes of conventional stock markets are observable. The moderate or high increase in performance slopes pose several challenges for predictive analysis, as they are influenced by other factors than conventional regulated market performance inferences. The results of this study are of intense interest to researchers and investors alike, as they demonstrate that investment slopes analysis sheds light on the intricacies of investment decisions, allowing a comprehensive assessment of both conventional markets and Bitcoin transactions.


 










 


In today's digital age, blockchain technology is being closely studied from a technical point of view and links to the Internet of Things (IoT) [
1
] as well as its impact on financial investment [
2
,
3
]. A secure blockchain is a distributed network in which information is stored as a chain-connected block. This innovative technology is based on cryptography and decentralization principles, ensuring high data security and integrity. Using cryptographic algorithms, the blockchain can help or face challenges in ensuring privacy and protection against fraud and manipulation [
4
]. The combination of cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms enables a variety of uses for blockchain technology, such as the development of applications with enhanced security, blockchain distribution networks, intelligent grids or digital financial systems.
Previous studies indicate that blockchain technology reveals new operational opportunities for financial service providers, considering the interest of conventional market agents in adopting the blockchain in operational trade, processing capabilities or reporting financial systems [
5
,
6
]. Server-based reporting systems, traditionally used in conventional markets, are under profound transformation [
7
], and blockchain technology is used not only as a trend, but also as a way forward for traditional market agents to achieve innovative operational advances and increased operational security. However, one of the most evocative immersions of blockchain technology into conventional markets is the innovative use of blockchain to create crypto-assets and the expansive attraction of investors to adopt blockchain currencies for investment portfolio diversification [
2
,
8
].
The widespread advances in blockchain technologies have shown that any context can present opportunities for those who focus on obtaining information. The innovative nature of blockchain technology, combined with the world of financial investments, has become fascinating and full of opportunities, risks and challenges [
9
]. As technology is constantly changing, information can be the key to success. Since the adoption of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, the blockchain has quickly become an economic hotspot [
8
,
10
]. The challenge for regulators, financial institutions and the attraction of individuals to invest in blockchain technology has grown rapidly. However, along with the excitement of technological development and the breakthrough in the investment of crypto for portfolio diversification comes the stress of finding the right solutions to secure the gains and mitigate the losses. The search for appropriate solutions for investment requires inspiration and knowledge. Numerous recent research studies on emerging technologies have focused on key aspects of blockchain, such as security, reliability and trust in crypto investments.
Several research studies have addressed different perspectives on blockchain security and have drawn divergent conclusions [
11
] such as highlighting positive aspects, or elaborating on security concerns, challenges and risks. Studies point to the positive security characteristics of blockchain technology in accounting and corporate financial reporting [
12
], logistics and supply chain management [
13
], improving the operational efficiency of the health industry [
14
], increasing the compliance potential of companies in applied information sharing practices and safeguarding sensitive data [
15
]. Zamani et al. [
16
] investigated a series of blockchain incidents based on understanding the root causes, and formulated recommendations for prevention and security consolidation. Such security risks in blockchain technology surpass the widely debated regulatory insufficiencies and address aspects such as the permissionless of blockchain caused by restrictive network hashing power [
17
], poor design or vulnerability of smart contracts [
18
], suspicious or malicious breaches of currency blockchains [
19
] with the purpose of altering wallet addresses and digital wallet breaches [
20
]. Given the decentralization of blockchain technologies and the large number of parties involved and the association with different Internet of Things capabilities, researchers draw signals that all the risks associated with blockchain security are yet to be discovered.
The choice to invest in cryptocurrencies stimulated research in looking for answers regarding motivation, modernism, sustainable impact or ignorance [
21
]. Researchers have turned to game theory or capital market theory to understand and to analyze the complex decision-making process of investors in conventional stock markets. According to game theory, stock market choices may be understood similarly to playing a game, when a participant's actions are influenced by the actions of others [
22
,
23
]. The actions and the strategic choices of investors to buy, sell or hold certain portfolio assets are interconnected with market dynamics.
When it comes to predicting the flow of the supply and demand of stock markets or the values of future returns, the capital market theory was preferred by many researchers. Predicting a stock's expected return is related to systematic risk and market dynamics. According to the modern portfolio theory, developed by Harry Markovitz [
24
] and followed by many researchers since [
25
], an investment portfolio may be considered efficient if potential high returns may be attained at the lowest possible risk exposure. To achieve efficiency, investors are advised to share common assumptions, borrow at risk-free rates and strive for the highest returns while maintaining a low propensity to risk.
However, the literature shows that conventional market theories seem to lead to divergent results when comparing similar principles to crypto assets investments [
26
,
27
,
28
]. The complexity of investment trends assessment or prediction is undeniable. Finding unifying methods to assess complex portfolio investment trends, including both conventional assets and cryptocurrency, is a research gap that this study strives to fill.
Considering the complexities of motivation, associated risks and uncertainty attributed to cryptocurrency investments, this study followed a new research path. The diachronic evolution of conventional or unconventional assets included in investment portfolios can be comprehensively tracked using investment slopes.
The investment slope is a useful managerial tool for investment portfolio decisions [
29
] that can be applied to both traditional market assets and cryptocurrencies. Considering the conventional meaning of the investment line slope, which is the representation of the 'rise' (change in investment) over the 'run' (change in return), this study investigated whether the marginal propensity to invest in Bitcoin may be associated with conventional market investment scenarios.
Based on past known market trends and conventional market theory, the research question that this study investigated was whether the investment slopes in the conventional markets can influence the unconventional market of Bitcoin transactions, considering both normal market conditions and crisis times.
The novelty of this study is reinforced by the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to provide a comprehensive and unified assessment of three major characteristics of the economic-intensive blockchain system in the context of conventional market imperfect conditions: reliability, investment slopes, financial and accounting aspects, ultimately determining confidence or risk in the choice of investing in cryptocurrency. This study of the relationship between investment slopes of BTC and conventional investments contributes to the literature in more than one way. The analysis is calibrated to quantify to what extent investments in BTC would provide economic returns as to observe incentives of the impact of conventional regulated investment trends, complementing the context with empirical assertions on consumers' trust, reliability of the blockchain, regulatory incentives and financial crises. The investment slopes analysis offers a set of practical methods to assess market trends comprehensively and promptly. Additionally, the study actively contributes to building a unifying image of investment markets, whether conventional or unconventional. Evocative empirical assertions are highlighted to deepen the understanding of the intricate context of investment decisions.
An analysis of the evolution of Bitcoin investors' behavior in the market was developed, dividing these evolutions into three investment slopes: (a) the decrease slope reflects investment losses; (b) the moderate increase slope is the period of investment revival for up to 10% in investment returns; (c) the high increase slope represents a high increase in investment profitability (>10% compared to the bottom of BTC investment). By examining the slopes of Bitcoin since 2014 in the context of conventional markets, atypical developments may be observed, with steep rises and falls compared to other conventional investment assets of regulated markets. In these conditions, it is necessary to deepen the analysis of the possible causes, correlations and determinants of cryptocurrency developments in relation to the profitability slopes of other investment assets.
The empirical analyses investigated the following research hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1 (H1).
  
There is a correlation between the evolution of investment slopes of BTC compared to other conventional market assets.
Hypothesis 2 (H2).
  
The evolution of the investment slopes of conventional regulated markets influences the evolution of the investment slopes of the blockchain market represented by BTC.
Reliability is an important parameter of the blockchain [
30
] and a crucial issue in the investment world [
31
]. Investors are looking for assets or instruments that give them confidence in maintaining their value and performance over time. The secure blockchain brings a new dimension of reliability in the transactions and transfers of digital assets such as Bitcoin. By their nature, secure blockchains eliminate the need for central intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, to validate and confirm transactions. Transaction validation is performed by a decentralized network of nodes, which in theory reduces the risk of human errors and fraud. Studies show that these beneficial aspects of decentralization are outweighed by the risks associated with the security of globally dispersed blockchain networks [
16
]. With no proper centralization of data, i.e., no unitary control system, the principle on which blockchain technology is based is that of trust between participants in the network concerned. Therefore, secure blockchains can be regarded as tools based on investors' trust in the activities of other participants in the blockchain network. Blockchain technology offers a reliable solution for the preservation and transfer of digital assets, with the potential to improve accounting activities [
32
]. Nevertheless, the absence of unified control over the entire operations between network nodes creates room for ethical deviations and incompatible competitive behavior [
33
].
As a result, confidence acquires dual importance in the financial investment sphere. On the one hand, the trust in the blockchain system is given based on the principle of transparency and certainty, relying on the users' perception, experience and affectivity towards the blockchain [
34
]. On the other hand, trust can be quantified by the confidence given by the willingness of many individuals to invest time or capital in cryptocurrencies [
35
,
36
]. Trust is dependent on the collective interest of the participants [
37
]. If the common interest in achieving the financial performance of the entire blockchain system is known and protected by blockchain-specific data protection rules, the common interest of participants may be reflected in the direction of increasing the reliability and performance of the cryptographic investment network. However, if the interests of individuals are channeled towards obtaining their own benefits without considering the common-sense principles of the blockchain, the risk of fraud or security breaches may occur, with the consequence of affecting the security of blockchain systems.
Most of past research focuses on blockchain security and privacy [
38
], risks and challenges [
16
]. Few studies have investigated the reliability and trust of data in blockchain technology [
37
] and even fewer have examined the need for a modern comprehensive theoretical framework in which blockchain technology may be integrated with conventional market understanding in the context of the adoption and development of cryptocurrency [
39
,
40
]. Our contribution to the literature is calibrated by an analysis of the relationship between the evolution of Bitcoin's investment slopes in the context of existing asymmetric market information, adding new insights to the literature concerning the choice and the trust to invest in cryptocurrency.
Interest in investigating the adoption of cryptocurrency for investment purposes is growing. Various studies have examined the use of Bitcoin in the diversification of investment portfolios [
41
,
42
,
43
] and offered divergent results. On the one hand, research finds Bitcoin to be a diversifier in an investment portfolio and not a hedge [
26
], highlighting BTC's significant influence of the spillover effect in relation to other assets [
27
,
43
]. Other studies show that Bitcoin can be considered a hedge over short-time horizons under extreme financial market conditions [
42
,
44
]. Corbet et al. [
28

Bitcoin price was flat on Wednesday even as the US dollar index (DXY) bounced back. The BTC/USD pair was trading at 35,370 close to the year-to-date high of 36,000. It has risen by over 33% from the lowest level in October dollar index rebound

The US dollar index rose in the overnight session as American bond yields pulled back. The index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose to $105.60. At the same time, the 10-year and 30-year bond yields dropped to 4.56% and 4.7%. The 5-year yield fell to 4.57%.

Bitcoin also consolidated as American stocks continued rising. The Dow Jones index rose by 62 points while the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 rose by 20 and 150 points. These indices are having their longest bull run since 2021.

Bitcoin has done well for several reasons. First, there are rising hopes that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. In its decision last week, the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%.

With inflation easing, economists expect the bank will leave rates intact. Federal Reserve Chairman, the head of the Federal Reserve, will deliver a statement later on Wednesday.

Second, there are signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the coming months. Companies like Blackrock, Frederick Templeton, and Ark Invest have applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF.

Further, Bitcoin is doing well, helped by the upcoming halving, which will happen in late April. Historically, Bitcoin tends to do well ahead of a halving event. Halving reduces Bitcoin rewards by half.

Meanwhile, a Bloomberg analysis shows that more Bitcoin mining sold more Bitcoins in October than they mined. They sold these coins to benefit with the rising BTC prices/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a tight range in the past few weeks. It has consolidated at the important resistance point at 35,000. The pair has moved above the 50-period moving average while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has drifted upwards.

Further, the pair has formed a bullish pennant pattern, which is shown in yellow. Volume has drifted upwards in the past few days. Therefore, with the pennant nearing the confluence level, there is a likelihood that it will have a bullish breakout to 37,000.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis last Monday that Bitcoin was stuck in a narrowing triangle pattern , and although the action above $35k was quite bearish, the triangle seemed more supportive than resistant as there is a support level quite confluent with its lower edge.

It therefore seemed likely that the support level at $34,669 is going to be today's pivotal point. This was a great call as although it took until the next day to happen, the price made a major bullish breakout and came rising out of the triangle pattern to perform very strongly, making a new 17-month high price just a few hours ago not far from $37,000.

The technical picture now is simply bullish and is backed by a strong felling among crypto analysts that the US is likely to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETFs over the next few weeks or months, which will open the Bitcoin market more fully to retail investors.

Technically, the price is effectively trading in blue sky, which is very bullish.

The only thing bulls should watch out for is that the price is currently very close to the resistance level at $37,179.

Bitcoin will be very attractive to trend traders now.

I will look for a long trade today if the price retraces to the support level at $35,469 and makes a bullish bounce there.

Regarding the US Dollar, there will be a release of US unemployment claims data at 1:30pm London time.

On the 11th of October BTC/USD was trading near the 26,700.00 level. It does not take a math degree to figure out that Bitcoin has gained a bit more than 10,000.00 in a little less than one month. Speculators who shake their heads in disdain regarding the gains made recently, because they have not participated in the move higher cannot be blamed. One burned, twice shy, but unfortunately with BTC/USD, it is a case often of ten times burned, not participating and Backers Saying 'I Told You So'

Again, I am not a backer of Bitcoin. I believe it is too dangerous and do not trust some of the fundamental questions I have regarding the digital asset. However, those who do believe in Bitcoin are in a happy state if they have profited. Day traders though still are confronted with the task of finding a situation in which they can comfortably trade BTC/USD. The fast moving digital asset needs to have entry points to get into a position safely. Risk management is essential, because – not to be a stick in the mud – as fast as BTC/USD can go up, it can also come down.



I have no bold predictions; I have been wrong about the current trend in BTC/USD and will remain out of the market.

Some analysts are using the word parabolic – meaning they believe the speed of the upwards movement can actually gather strength.

However, history shows us volatility has frequently been in the other direction too for BTC/USD and reversals lower can quickly take place. If you speculate in BTC/USD use risk management, conservative leverage and hope you are on the correct side of the trade. If you do achieve profits it may be a good idea to cash them out before whipsaw and violent moves turn your winnings into losses.

So what's next for BTC/USD? Good question and my answer is I do not know. Via technical charts BTC/USD has not traded its current value since May of 2022. And this occurred when BTC/USD was coming off of highs seen in March of 2022 near 48,000.00. And for speculative giggles let's remember BTC/USD was trading near 69,000.00 in November of 2021 Predictions and Risk ManagementBitcoin Short-Term Outlook:

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis last week that Bitcoin was stuck in a consolidation pattern between $33,445 and $35,000. I thought that the resistance at $35,000 was more likely to hold than to break.

This was a good call for that day, as the price just consolidated within those levels.

The technical picture now is more bullish, as the price has advanced a bit beyond $35k before falling back, with that round number now effectively erased as an infective resistance – it has now become a zone of consolidation where the price is comfortable to chop around.

The price chart below shows the current action is dominated by a narrowing triangle pattern , and although the action above $35k is quite bearish, the triangle seems more supportive than resistant as there is a support level quite confluent with its lower edge.

It therefore seems likely that the support level at $34,669 is going to be today's pivotal point. There is a long-term bullish trend which remains valid, so a long trade from a bullish bounce off that level could make sense.

Another bullish factor which might impact Bitcoin is the news that Hong Kong is considering allowing spot crypto ETFs.

Alternatively, if the price breaks down convincingly below the support level at $34,669, that could be a bearish sign, so two consecutive lower hourly closes below that level could be used to trigger a short trade entry, as the price would have room to fall a lot further before meeting other support levels.

There is nothing of high importance scheduled today concerning the US Dollar.

Do you want to trade or invest in Bitcoin but need to know how it works? Here is a guide on Bitcoin trading and investing.

Bitcoin has proven to be a fantastic investment asset for over a decade. Although this digital asset is volatile, it entices investors to invest because the network assures them high returns in the long run.

Trading and investing are two of the most common ways to use this digital money. To some, investing and trading are new words, while others might mean the same thing. Investing and trading electronic money are two essential Bitcoin pillars. However, investing and trading have some differences between them.

Understanding Bitcoin Trading

Most Bitcoin traders have the goal of accumulating wealth fast. While investing is a slow, measured approach, trading is a fast-paced way to make money. People trade this electronic money with long-term or short-term goals. Selling this electronic money also requires registering with a reputable exchange. Platforms like the Bit QT allow individuals to register and start purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies.

However, trading involves buying this digital asset at a lower value and selling it when the price increases. These digital money traders follow news and events at all hours of the day to look for indicators that Bitcoins value will increase.

This electronic asset is notoriously volatile hence why it is a high-risk asset. Purchasing this electronic money at a low price means you pay a low amount of fiat money. Selling this virtual asset at a higher price means receiving more conventional funds than you spent on its purchase. Moreover, trading involves medium-sized traders, but large trades also occur.

Benefits of Trading Bitcoin

Possibility of accumulating high returns in a short period

You can start buying and selling this electronic asset with a small amount of fiat money

You can trade Bitcoin 24/7

Disadvantages of Trading Bitcoin

Traders need to understand their risk tolerance

Bitcoin is volatile hence increasing the chances of accumulating losses

Bitcoin Investment

Investing in this virtual money is not a means of accumulating wealth overnight. A Bitcoin investment earns wealth and not short-term profits. In simpler terms, an asset is when someone purchases this electronic money with the hope it will increase in value over time.

When you decide to invest in this virtual money, you don't intend to spend it anytime soon. Instead, investors look to gradually build profits by buying and holding this electronic money for a long time.

This digital money price only affects investment a little short time. However, investors need to understand the risks involved in this electronic money investment. Like with all financial strategies, there is a chance that the initial investment will not grow in value or may even be lost.

Investing in this digital asset is unusual because serious investors tend to pay much attention to news or current affairs regarding the markets on a day-to-day basis. Investors are ready to hold this virtual currency through several price cycles. Therefore, if the price of this electronic asset drops, investors might not sell. The thought behind the theory is that the cost of most assets tends to increase over time. Investors had on this digital money because it is a higher returns investment.

Benefits of a Bitcoin Investment

Possible Short-term accumulating wealth over time, not short-term profits

Investment is easier to manage

Limited taxable events

Risks of a Bitcoin Investment

At times the wait is not worth the reward

You must have adequate knowledge to invest in Bitcoin

Investing is not for the impatient

Final Thoughts

Bitcoin is one of the greatest innovations that Satoshi Nakamoto did create. So, before deciding to invest or trade this virtual money, you should research thoroughly. Both trading and investing are excellent means of accumulating profits with this digital money.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/05/pr_15215_89b4a1e1_image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,9.205715,94ee613c34a96ace6b65153484fd5909

This potential development holds significant importance for investors, as it could offer them a means to track the price fluctuations of digital currencies without needing to possess them directly.



Speculation has been mounting concerning BlackRock, the investment behemoth, considering listing its iShares ETF on the platform of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) clearinghouse. If BlackRock moves forward with this listing, it will join a growing list of companies with pending applications for Bitcoin-related offerings in the United States.



As Steen Jacobsen, the Head of IT at Saxo Bank, underlines, the value of any asset is inherently tied to the number of people utilizing it. The advent of an ETF is anticipated to have a substantial impact on market liquidity and generate heightened interest in cryptocurrency markets.



Regarding the price of digital currencies, Bitcoin registered a slight increase of 0.03 percent, reaching a value of USD34,884 during Tuesday's trading. The market capitalization of Bitcoin remained relatively stable at USD681 billion.



This potential approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's conversion into an ETF represents a significant milestone in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments, as traditional financial institutions explore ways to tap into the growing digital asset market. The growing interest in such financial products is expected to bring further liquidity and potentially more participants into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, thereby influencing the overall market dynamics.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_14.jpg,False,@menafn,7.0734186,2d4dd0919b02a1e336c6fd8ce883bf1e

Data from blockchain analysis firm Glassnode reveals a notable trend: a significant portion of Bitcoin's circulating supply is firmly in the hands of long-term holders, with figures reaching record heights. Notably, the trend of Bitcoin being tightly held is not a new phenomenon, but the level of accumulation we're witnessing today appears unprecedented. Glassnode's research points out that the community of long-term Bitcoin holders is not just growing but doing so at an 'impressive rate of accumulation.' This cohort's commitment is evidenced by the historical highs in key supply metrics—illiquid supply, coins held (HODLed), and long-term holder supply—are all at their peak, according to shared Glassnode insights. Related Reading:  A Dive into Bitcoin's Illiquid Supply  Glassnode's briefing depicted the Bitcoin market's current state. The data illustrates that 68% of Bitcoin's circulating supply has not moved for more than a year, indicating a decision by investors to hold through volatility and market dips. The metric for coins held for over five years is even more telling, constituting nearly a third of all Bitcoin in circulation. In terms of Bitcoin's illiquid supply—coins held in wallets with little to no spending history—the figures are also at an all-time high, with over 15.4 million BTC firmly held. This illiquidity is not a static condition as it is growing monthly at 71,000 Bitcoin, according to Glassnode's analysis. According to a Glassnode analyst, this accumulation has coincided with a notable pattern of investors pulling their Bitcoin from exchanges into private custody, further solidifying the trend of long-term holding. The analyst disclosed: The data suggests investors are continuing to withdraw their coins into custody, with over 1.7 million bitcoin doing so since May 2021. Bitcoin: Divergence In Holders And Latest Price Action Glassnode's report also highlights a significant divergence between the behaviors of long-term and short-term Bitcoin holders. While long-term supply is seeing historic highs, short-term holder supply is at record lows, indicating a change in spending habits after the currency's surge above the pivotal $30,000 benchmark.  Glassnode's analysis suggests this price point is a crucial battleground for bullish sentiment, marking a potential inflection point in the market's trajectory.

Bitcoin price staged a strong comeback in the overnight session as demand for the coin continued. The BTC/USD pair rose to a high of 37,985, the highest point since April last year. It has soared by over 140% from the lowest point in December last year of a dovish Fed

Bitcoin continued its recent rally as investors reacted to the latest economic data from the United States. In a report on Tuesday, the US published encouraging inflation data. The data revealed that the headline inflation dropped from 3.7% in September to 3.2% in October.

The same report showed that the core CPI retreated from 4.2% in September to 4.0% in October. These numbers were weaker than what analysts were expecting. In addition, the Producer Price Index (PPI) continued falling in October.

The US also published weak jobs numbers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the economy created 150k jobs while the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9% in October.

These numbers mean that the Federal Reserve will likely pause rates between 5.25% and 5.50% in December. Historically, Bitcoin tends to do well when the Fed is either lowering rates or when it has signaled it will lower them.

Bitcoin also rose as investors waited for the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Most analysts believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve ETFs filed by companies like Blackrock, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton.

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, one of the most popular players in Wall Street, maintained her bullish view of Bitcoin. She maintains that Bitcoin is a digital gold and that its price will continue rising in the coming years. She expects that the coin will continue rising and hit over $600k in the coming years/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. It has now moved above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement point on the daily chart. The BTC/USD pair has jumped over the important resistance level at 31,700, the highest point in July this year and June last year.

The BTC/USD pair sits above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). In the long-term, the pair has formed an inverted head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, the outlook for the pair is bullish, with the next point to watc being at 40,000.

The BTC/USD pair retreated in the overnight session even as more institutions embraced cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price retreated to a low of $36,770, which was a few points below last week's high of 37,985 Bitcoin futures

Bitcoin has done well in the past few months, helped by the ongoing concept of TradFi. TradFi refers to a situation where companies in traditional finance are embracing digital assets.

The most prominent of these companies are firms like Blackrock, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which have all applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF. If approved, these companies aim to attract billions of dollars from both retail and institutional investors.

On Monday, Cboe, a leading company in the financial services industry, said that it would launch trading and clearing in margin futures for Bitcoin and Ether. This launch will make it the first US regulated crypto native combined exchange and clearing house. It will support both spot and leveraged derivatives in a single platform.

Cboe joins CME to offer these futures. CME's futures volume recently passed those of other companies like Binance, Deribit, and OKX.

Bitcoin also retreated in line with the performance of US equities. The S&P 500 index dropped slightly while the Nasdaq 100 fell by over 12 points. This performance happened as traders reacted to the warning by Moody's, which warned about the soaring public debt and dysfunction in Congress.

There is also a rising possibility that the American government will shut down next week as Democrats and Republicans differ on the way forward. Democrats have rejected the proposal by Speaker Mike Johnson to keep the government open.

The next important catalyst for the BTC/USD pair will be the latest US consumer inflation data. Economists believe that inflation retreated slightly in October as the price of gasoline drifted lower/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair peaked at 37,986 last week as demand continued soaring. It has now pulled back as some traders have started taking profits. Along the way, Bitcoin has moved back to the ascending channel, which connects the lowest and highest swings since October 24th.

Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pulled back to the neutral point of 50. Therefore, the outlook for Bitcoin is bearish for now, with the next reference level being at 36,000, the highest swing on November 2nd.

The answer is... First, why is November 17th a key date for the SEC to appro","(MENAFN- TimesNewswire ) Will the SEC approve a BTC spot ETF on Friday, November 17th? The answer is...

First, why is November 17th a key date for the SEC to approve a BTC spot ETF? Let's explore the reason.

James Seyffart of Bloomberg posted on social media platform X that there is a small window from November 9th to 17th for the SEC to issue a 19b-4 approval order. However, applications submitted later by Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, and Global X will enter the public review period on November 17th, at which time the SEC will close the approval window for 12 BTC spot ETFs, including those represented by BlackRock.

During the public review period, the SEC will not process approvals for BTC spot ETFs. The next round of approvals can only be scheduled after the public review process ends, which will be in January 2024.

Therefore, November 17th is merely the date when the SEC closes the approval window for BTC spot ETFs, which is also the last date for the SEC to decide whether to approve BTC spot ETF applications this year. Whether the BTC spot ETF will be approved on November 17th can be inferred from the following content.

Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store and host of the ETF Prime podcast, posted on X, quoting Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, saying that although it is generally believed that the SEC prefers to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in bulk to avoid showing favoritism in a highly competitive market.

The consensus is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in bulk, as the agency wants to avoid being seen as playing the kingmaker role in a high-risk and competitive market. However, the time window for the SEC to issue a batch of 19b-4 approval orders for spot Bitcoin ETFs before Friday, November 17th, is narrow.

Geraci also introduced the difference between the 19b-4 approval order and the SEC's approval of each issuer's registration statement. Although the former is a procedural step to allow ETFs to be listed and traded, the latter is more important for the actual launch of these ETFs. He emphasized,'The SEC still needs to approve each issuer's registration statement (S-1, or #Grayscale's S-3), which is more important for the actual launch time and may be issued later.







So, when the BTC spot ETF will be approved and when it can be officially launched remains a mysterious case with some suspense, requiring our continued attention to related news.

Regardless of whether the spot Bitcoin ETF can be approved this year, the convenient and secure cryptocurrency exchange #Salavi is launching a global campaign with the theme'Participate in copy trading, profits are yours, losses are ours, and there are plenty of USDT rewards!' The goal is to further activate the cryptocurrency market sentiment by providing users with rich rewards.

The cryptocurrency reached $36,856, marking its highest valuation since May 2022. In tandem with Bitcoin's rise, Ethereum, a smaller cryptocurrency in comparison, witnessed a 2.2 percent increase, while Solana advanced by 3.2 percent.



The surge in Bitcoin's value is closely tied to the speculation surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts James Seyphart and Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg Intelligence revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been granted a short deadline of at least eight days to ""issue theoretical approval orders"" for Bitcoin ETFs. The analysts noted that even if official approvals are not granted this month, there is a belief that there is a chance for an announcement of approval by January 10, 2023.



The anticipation of regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs has been a key driver in the recent surge, as the cryptocurrency market reacts to the potential mainstream adoption and investment opportunities that these financial instruments could bring.

The development and application of blockchain-based technologies have been overshadowed by the performance of cryptocurrencies and the belief that these are all that this technology has to offer. This idea has led to the question on numerous occasions if this technology is just expectations or if there are indeed applications that solve problems in today's world. This bibliometric study on the current state of blockchain applications in the context of digital transformation seeks to break down the myth that this technology is just expectations, synthesizing and ordering the wide variety of topics that arise from this relationship. The results showed that the development of blockchain in the context of digital transformation is growing at an exponential rate, and with this, its applications have come to cover a large part of the industries, interact with other technologies, and establish objectives of all kinds. Based on these topics of technologies, industries, operational objectives, and strategic objectives, a structure is proposed that will serve as a guide for the development of new solutions to some problems, research, applications, and integrations with other technologies.

'Blockchain technology has long been associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but there is so much more that it has to offer, particularly in how public and private organisations secure, share and use data,'—Steve Davies, Global Leader, PwC UK [
1
].
The development of blockchain technology was initially aimed at cryptocurrency-based monetary systems, leading to extremely high expectations and countless adherents [
2
]. This is not surprising as many have enriched themselves through the Bitcoin market and the crypto market activity has grown steadily. This monetary commitment sustains such high expectations and leads many to claim blockchain as one of the most-disruptive technologies with capabilities to genuinely transform the world [
3
]. However, the reality shows that there are some issues with blockchain technology, which has given rise to a discussion of whether it is solely rooted in expectations rather than promoting benefits and transformation. This has led to a division among scholars, with one group advocating in favor of blockchain's potential [
3
] and the other more skeptical, placing doubts on its benefits [
4
].
The persisting controversy is problematic, as it leads to confusion and low construct clarity, giving rise to the question of whether blockchain can bring augmented value or is merely blended with Bitcoin and its ups and downs [
5
]. Current financial figures offer support to the optimistic views. The global blockchain technology market is valued at USD 10.02 million with an expected annual growth rate of 87.7% until 2030, of which the financial market segment accounts for 37%. Cryptocurrencies represent only a portion of this financial market segment [
6
]. Thus, value stems mainly from other sources than cryptocurrencies. Despite the above, blockchain continues to be confused with cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin specifically. This problem has been captured in some surveys, showing that 2 out of 3 people in the U.S. believe that blockchain is the same as cryptocurrencies and 1 out of 2 believe it is the same as Bitcoin [
7
]. This situation shows that there is even more ignorance on the subject, confirming that the hype around Bitcoin has overshadowed the whole picture about blockchain. Meanwhile, other research shows that business decision-makers still struggle to grasp blockchain's potential applications, often failing to embed the technology into innovation and value-added activities [
8
]. This context reveals that there is a lack of understanding of blockchain, in general [
9
], as well as in the academic and organizational spheres, with a greater concern for the latter as the implementer of these systems.
We agree with [
7
,
10
] that, given the exponential growth of blockchain and its presence in more and more industries, organizational leaders, entire industries, and regulators must gain a better understanding of the technology's promising applications and its potential for digital transformation. Likewise, we agree with [
9
] that, when reviewing the current literature on the subject, we find that most of the articles on this technology are of a technical and descriptive nature. Thus, some work of this nature shows the benefits of blockchain, such as real-time, transparent information exchange through shared systems in port and maritime transport [
11
], unified systems for education to overcome territorial limitations [
12
], the basis for business model innovation in the pension industry [
13
], and the redesign of entire supply chain networks, improving transparency, reducing waste, and protecting against unethical information manipulation [
11
,
14
,
15
]. Without exception, blockchain's applications come together with other technologies such as the cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) [
16
,
17
,
18
]. These aspects, combined with the persisting confusion and controversy, are ingredients that emphasize the complexity surrounding the application of blockchain and the plurality in the relationship with other digital transformation technologies.
Against this background, the literature has promoted several reviews and bibliometric analyses. The studies are, nevertheless, of a specific nature, focusing on a specific industry, such as education [
19
], or on a specific field, such as management and business [
20
] and supply chains [
21
]. Only one study attempted to provide a holistic literature review, but included only a few studies in its sample because many studies were not available at the time, failing to find comprehensive clusters and order in the literature [
10
]. In general, existing reviews do not provide an orderly and clarifying structure on what topics are dealt with in the development of blockchain in the context of digital transformation, thus aligning with the existing controversy and supporting the existence of chaos and disorder in the body of knowledge.
To cover this gap, the goal of this study was to clarify the current status of the application of blockchain technology in the context of digital transformation by showing its impact in today's world. In doing so, we highlight how digital transformation gives significant purpose to the implementation of blockchain. In terms of this goal, we understand digital transformation as a process that involves the development of new business models that are unique to the firm or industry, which requires changes that involve the entire organization. This phenomenon goes beyond digitization and is not just about implementing technology, but about giving it a strategic purpose that allows, for example, achieving barrier-free interaction between all participants in a supply chain. We intend to change the prevailing perception of this technology and dispel the recurring confusion that links it to cryptocurrencies. We achieved this through an analysis that considered the evolution of the literature in this field and its current structure. We aimed to break down the latter into an understandable structure that accurately reflects the current state of research in the field. The ambition was not only to provide a necessary update to the existing analysis, but also to clearly connect blockchain and digital transformation. We considered this necessary because emerging technologies such as blockchain are not an end in themselves; organizations are not interested in just acquiring them, but in perceiving the most benefits from them. In this sense, the current context or end of digital transformation gives purpose to the adoption of them. To this end, we conducted an in-depth bibliometric study, combining the R program bibliometrix with VOSviewer. We provide a temporal overview that helps identify which literature feeds this relationship, which are the most-relevant articles to date, what its structure is, as well as identify countries and leading journals in this field. Our findings show that blockchain in the context of the digital transformation literature can be organized into four clusters: technologies, industries, operational objectives, and strategic objectives. These findings offer valuable insights into the advancement of blockchain within the digital transformation context and its status. They elucidate the specific industries where blockchain technology is being applied, its integration with other technologies, the operational objectives it pursues, and the organizational goals that drive its implementation. Additionally, the article provides some of the challenges that exist in the digital transformation and discusses how blockchain is contributing to this process and what new issues its implementation is generating.
This paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2
 details the methodology used to obtain the bibliometric results. 
Section 3
 presents the results obtained. 
Section 4
 analyzes the results from a theoretical point of view, and finally, 
Section 5
 discusses the practical implications of the results obtained.
A bibliometric analysis was conducted to recreate a performance analysis and science mapping to help us identify the structure of the literature, its most-significant contributions, and its development over time. The latter sought to provide a review of the past, present, and future of the relationship between blockchain and digital transformation. This was achieved by carrying out a co-citation analysis, a bibliographic coupling, and a co-word analysis. With this purpose, the following four stages proposed by Donthu et al. [
22
] were followed.
The first step is the definition of the objectives and the scope of the bibliometric analysis, which are related to the retrospective performance and structure of a research field and the volume it possesses [
22
]. For this purpose, objectives were defined considering the three general questions that bibliometrics can answer [
23
]. The main objectives defined are the recognition of the past (intellectual base), present (literature structure), and future (conceptual structure dynamics) of this relationship. Additionally, it seeks to name the most-relevant articles, journals, and countries in the literature and see what can be concluded.
In the second step, the bibliometric techniques necessary to achieve the proposed objectives were chosen. As a result of this process, we decided to initially conduct a performance analysis of the documents to be analyzed, which considered their main information and the most-relevant articles, countries, and journals. Subsequently, a science mapping analysis was carried out, which included co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and co-word analysis. The co-citation analysis helped us identify the intellectual base of the literature, allowing us to recognize its beginnings [
22
]. The bibliographic coupling gave us the articles with the most-significant impact. Finally, the co-word analysis was carried out to identify the formation of clusters and the dynamics of their topics [
23
].
For the third step, the topics of blockchain and digital transformation were searched in all Web of Science database fields, using the following search 'Blockchain' AND 'Digital transformation' with no exclusion criteria. By the latter, we mean that there is no definition of dates, authors, journals, or any other exclusion parameter. As the relationship between these terms is recent, only 192 publications were found between 2018 and 2022. Since this study covered all aspects of this relationship, all publications were downloaded in bib format to be processed in bibliometrix and plain text format for use in VOSviewer. Regarding the data collected, all the publications' fields were chosen to carry out a complete analysis.
For the analysis of the extracted data, bibliometrix and VOSviewer were used. With the first one, the primary information about the documents was obtained, as well as a specification about its annual growth, the identification of the most-productive countries and journals, and the recognition of the most-relevant articles. With the second one, the co-word and co-citation network visualizations were obtained, along with overlay and density visualizations for the first one.
The establishment and development of the relationship between blockchain and digital transformation in the scientific literature are recent, having an average age of 1.84 years. As can be seen in 
Table 1
, 192 documents published on the Web of Science between 2019 and 2022 were found, coming from 121 different sources. The publications consisted mostly of scientific articles (154 publications), followed by reviews (33 publications) and a smaller number of editorial materials (5 publications).
The production over the years, as shown in 
Table 2
, presents an upward trend, with more than half of the documents published in 2022 (101). The remaining papers were published in the previous four years, with 43 articles in 2021, 31 in 2020, 11 in 2019, and just 6 in 2018. A comprehensive review of scientific output in this research field indicates an annual growth rate of 103%.
In 
Table 3
, in an examination of scientific production, considering the country of origin of the documents included in the bibliometric analysis, a substantial presence of Chinese authors (23 articles) can be observed. The following four positions, occupied by Italy (13 articles), Germany, Spain, and the United States, have almost an equal number of authors (12 articles).

Bitcoin price staged a relief rally as traders reflected on several important developments in the industry. The BTC/USD pair jumped to a high of 37,635, the highest point in more than a month. It is nearing the year-to-date high of 37,950 Bitcoin news

Bitcoin price rose as traders reacted to several important news. First, the coin jumped after Argentina voted for Javier Milei to be the next president. He is a libertarian who believes in cryptocurrencies. He has also pledged to drastically reduce the size of the country's government.

The other news was a report that Binance was prepared to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to Bloomberg, the company was prepared to pay as much as $4 billion to end the lawsuit thar the SEC brought a few months ago.

Binance has been under scrutiny in the past few months as regulators accused it of offering unregistered securities and facilitating money laundering. In addition to the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (SEC) has also sued the company for offering derivatives against the law.

Bitcoin also rose after Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange, decided to buy Coindesk from Digital Currency Group. The purchase price was not mentioned.

Further, the BTC/USD pair rose as the US dollar index (DXY) plunged to the lowest level in months. It has dropped by more than 3% from the highest point this year as investors predict on the next action by the Federal Reserve.

Most analysts expect the Fed to maintain its interest rates at the current level and then start cutting them in 2024. The Fed will publish minutes of this month's meeting on Wednesday. Bitcoin and other risky assets do well when the Fed is a bit dovish/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin continued its recovery in the overnight session, helped by the positive crypto news. It was trading at 37,620, a few points below the year-to-date high of 37,950. It has also formed an ascending channel, which is shown in black. Also, it has remained above the 25-period and 50-period moving averages.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved above 60 while the MACD rose above the neutral point. Therefore, Bitcoin's upside will be confirmed if it moves above the resistance at 37,960. If this happens, it will likely rise to the next resistance point at 39,000.

Buy the BTC/USD pair and set a take-profit at 38,000. Add a stop-loss at 35,000.

Bullish view

Bitcoin price held quite steady above the key support level at $36,000 as traders waited for the next big catalyst. The BTC/USD pair was trading at 36,800 on Monday, much higher than last week's low of 24,780. It is a few points below the year-to-date high of 38,000 for the next catalyst

Bitcoin price has been muted in the past few days as the industry has had no major news. The most important news came out on Friday when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the Bitcoin ETF by BitGo and Franklin Templeton.

Most analysts believe that the SEC will ultimately accept some or all of these ETFs at the same time. If this happens, analysts expect that there will be more Bitcoin inflows when these inflows are approved.

Other analysts suspect that the positive impact of a Bitcoin ETF approval will be short-term since the coin is already available to most investors. For one, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), which tracks its futures, is already available to investors. It now has over $1 billion in assets.

The SEC has long been concerned about the viability of the safety of Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs. The regulators believe that Bitcoin is highly volatile and that it can be manipulated. Also, they see Bitcoin as a highly illiquid asset.

The BTC/USD price has also held steady as investors react to the ongoing macro events. The price of crude oil has pulled back from the year-to-date high of $95 to $80. Therefore, analysts expect that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates at the current level for a while.

The next important macro news to watch will be the upcoming minutes of the Federal Reserve . These minutes will provide more information about what to expect in next month's meeting/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has remained in a tight range in the past few weeks. On the 4H chart, the BTC/USD pair has formed an ascending channel and is now at the middle point. A closer look shows that the volume has been moving in a downtrend.

Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a descending channel, signaling a bearish divergence. The MACD has also formed a bearish divergence. Therefore, the pair will likely have a bearish breakout in the coming days. This could see it drop to the next psychological level at 35,000.

The proposal, if adopted, could mark a pivotal shift in Germany's economic policies by advocating for Bitcoin to be officially recognized as legal tender. Noteworthy in the proposal is an emphasis on the significance of privacy and adaptability in financial innovation.



This positive momentum in Bitcoin's value had a cascading effect on its derivatives, particularly futures contracts, which experienced a surge. The notional value of Bitcoin contracts also witnessed a steady increase, signaling a resurgence of interest in trading activities and a heightened level of confidence in the digital currency market.



In tandem with these developments, there is a growing anticipation surrounding the potential approval of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. This anticipation is indicative of the expected influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a growing readiness among investors to venture into digital assets.



Examining the specific numbers, Bitcoin's price climbed to USD37,350, underscoring the sustained positive response from investors. Concurrently, the total market capitalization of the leading cryptocurrency reached approximately USD730 billion, reflecting the growing prominence of Bitcoin in the broader financial landscape. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, these recent developments underscore the increasing acceptance and integration of digital currencies into mainstream financial systems.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_0.jpg,False,@menafn,9.1999855,b54d3afc5ca7dc5c3ab584c566895958

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis that as the price had been topping out at a long-term high, if the price remained below the resistance level at $35,902, I saw the day's outlook as bearish. The price in fact quickly broke above that level and continued to rise strongly over most of the day, making a new long-term high just below $38k.

The price has continued to range below that recent high, making quite deep retracements which have printed railway tracks on the daily price chart. This suggests increasing volatility which tends to spell the end of a trend, and if correct, this would be a bearish sign.

It is clear the price is probably in a fairly pivotal area. I think the best thing to do here is to wait for the price to make another attempt to break to a new high price.

If we get a daily close above $38k I will see that as a good long entry signal, as will most trend traders.

If we get another strong bearish rejection of the $38k area, this could be a good short trade, but due to the high volatility that trade could be a nervous ride.

Swing traders who are feeling very confidently bullish might try a long entry from the bullish bounce at the support level of $37,271 which already seems to be setting up as we approach the London open.

There is nothing of high importance regarding the US Dollar, as it is a public holiday today in the USA.

494,Celsius Network pivots to bitcoin mining after bankruptcy,Dietrich Knauth,2023-11-22 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2023/11/22/celsius-network-pivots-to-bitcoin-mining-after-bankruptcy,thestar.com.my,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crypto lender Celsius Network has scaled back its post-bankruptcy business plans to focus only on bitcoin mining, citing U.S. regulators' skepticism of its other planned business lines.","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crypto lender Celsius Network has scaled back its post-bankruptcy business plans to focus only on bitcoin mining, citing U.S. regulators' skepticism of its other planned business lines.

Celsius, whose restructuring plan had also envisioned the company earning ""staking"" fees by validating blockchain transactions and managing its legacy portfolio of cryptocurrency loans, said in a statement late Monday it had changed course after receiving ""feedback"" from the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.

Celsius declined to comment on Tuesday. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan had approved Celsius' Chapter 11 plan on Nov. 9, clearing the company to return cryptocurrency to customers and create a new company owned by Celsius creditors.

The SEC did not definitively say during Celsius' bankruptcy case whether the new company's business plans would violate U.S. law, but it reserved the right to make that determination later.

The SEC has argued in past public statements that most crypto lending and staking activity should be regulated to ensure that customers have sufficient information about how their crypto assets are used.

Celsius said it now plans to hold back certain assets that would have been transferred to the new company, and instead liquidate them as a part of the wind-down of its bankruptcy.

Bitcoin mining was always meant to be the ""core business"" of the new company, Celsius said.

The pivot has led to further negotiations with Fahrenheit, a consortium of bidders selected to lead the reorganized company. Celsius said it expects to seek court approval of a modified bankruptcy plan in the coming weeks.

Celsius said the ""reduction in scope and scale"" of the new company should lead to lower management fees and increase the amount of cryptocurrency Celsius will directly return to customers beginning in January 2024.

Fahrenheit, led by hedge fund Arrington Capital and U.S. Bitcoin Corp, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

New Jersey-based Celsius filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2022, one month after freezing customer accounts to prevent withdrawals. Celsius, once valued at $3 billion, was one of the largest crypto collapses in 2022, along with FTX, Voyager Digital and BlockFi. Crypto lenders Voyager and BlockFi decided to fully shut down their businesses and return some crypto to customers during their bankruptcies.

496,How To Buy Bitcoin Minetrix In 2023 Complete Walkthrough,MENAFN,2023-11-24 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107482220/How-To-Buy-Bitcoin-Minetrix-In-2023-Complete-Walkthrough,menafn.com,Bitcoin Minetrix is a new crypto project designed to simplify Bitcoin mining and allow everyone to earn BTC coins without using expensive hardware a,"This could be a game-changer in the Bitcoin mining space, especially when the new crypto bull run starts and pushes Bitcoin prices higher.

Native to this crypto project is the $BTCMTX token, which you use to earn Bitcoin mining credits. In this guide, we dive deeper into this project and explain how to buy Bitcoin Minetrix tokens.

Here's what you need to know about the Bitcoin Minetrix presale :



Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is a new cryptocurrency, which you can stake to earn Bitcoin mining credits.

Traditional Bitcoin mining relied on expensive hardware. You don't have to worry about selling it once you don't want to mine anymore. Simply unstake and sell your $BTCMTX tokens.

The minimum purchase amount of $BTCMTX during the presale is $10 worth of tokens. Bitcoin Minetrix token presale accepts ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT or a card.

The $BTCMTX token is an ERC20 token, meaning it works on the Ethereum network. Because of that, you need an Ethereum-based crypto wallet to complete the transaction.

MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets, which we recommend using in this case. However, you can choose whichever Ethereum-based wallet you want for this presale.

Visit MetaMask website and select download. You can add it as a browser extension or download it as a mobile app on your iOS or Android device.

Open MetaMask, create a password and write down your seed phrase. Store your seed phrase somewhere safe because you will need it to restore your crypto wallet in case you lose access to your smartphone or computer.

You need ETH, USDT or a card to buy $BTCMTX tokens. You can also buy them with BNB and MATIC, but you won't be able to earn any staking rewards during the presale if you buy with these two coins. That is why we recommend sticking with ETH or USDT.

Buy ETH or USDT on an exchange of your choice, such as Coinbase and Binance. You can do so either using a credit card, a bank transfer or any other method accepted at the exchange.



Once you have your ETH or USDT, withdraw them to your MetaMask wallet address.

Go to the Bitcoin Minetrix token presale site and click'Connect Wallet'. Select MetaMask, or select another wallet via the WalletConnect option.

Enter either the number of $BTCMTX tokens you want to buy or the amount of ETH or USDT you wish to spend. The site will automatically calculate the number of Bitcoin Minetrix tokens based on the current presale price.

You need to have 0.015 ETH in your wallet to pay for the transaction fees. Once you're ready, click the'Buy and Stake for rewards' button.

As soon as you buy your tokens in the presale, you can stake them but you can't withdraw them yet. Once the token presale ends, you can claim your tokens and sell them or keep staking them to earn Bitcoin mining credits.

Make sure to follow Bitcoin Minetrix on X (formerly Twitter) , and on the Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram channel to get updates on the project as well as when token withdrawals are enabled.

If you want to mine Bitcoin, you need expensive hardware and massive amounts of electricity to power that hardware. It took an estimated 1,449 kilowatt hours to mine one Bitcoin in 2022 , which would cost an average of $35,404 in electricity alone. A single Bitcoin ASIC miner starts from $2,900 , and not everyone can afford that. That's where Bitcoin Minetrix comes in.

With an innovative cloud mining solution, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to lower the entry barrier to Bitcoin mining and allow everyone with a small investment to take part in this endeavor.

The way it works, is you buy $BTCMTX tokens and you stake them. In return, you get non-transferable ERC20 token credits, which you can burn in exchange for BTC cloud mining time or a percentage of Bitcoin mining yields.

Once you get BTC in return for your mining credits, you are free to move it to your personal Bitcoin wallet or sell it on an exchange.

The $BTCMTX token presale aims to raise up to $15 million, according to the Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper , where 77.5% of the total token supply will be distributed via the token presale while keeping the remaining 22.5% for staking rewards and community initiatives.

The proceeds of 42.5% of the BTCMTX tokens sold in the presale will be used to fund the Bitcoin mining operations, while 35% will be used for marketing and growing the ecosystem.

The $BTCMTX token presale will run in 39 presale stages where each stage will see a small token price increase. During the first presale stage, you can buy $BTCMTX tokens for a price of $0.0110, while in the final presale stage, one $BTCMTX token will cost $0.0148.

That's a 34% difference between the first and final phases, which makes it prudent to buy the presale in the early stages to lock in a potentially better token price, especially if you plan to purchase $BTCMTX tokens anyway.

Here's how each token presale stage will go:",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/24/V_380daimage_story.png,False,@menafn,7.9791284,16b3b0c807b11bbfd3dc1db84baef741

Many view this development as a significant achievement, as it promises to broaden access to digital currency investments for both institutional and individual traders. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates indicate that the Bitcoin ETF market could potentially reach USD100 billion, underscoring the substantial impact expected from this financial innovation.



The imminent launch of Bitcoin ETFs is perceived as the initiation of a new upward cycle for the world's largest cryptocurrency. This development is seen as a pivotal moment, marking the entry of wealth managers and financial advisors into the burgeoning crypto sector. The prospect of these professionals allocating a portion of their extensive trillion-dollar portfolios toward the promising cryptocurrency market is gaining traction.

As traditional financial institutions embrace these instruments, it signifies a growing recognition of the legitimacy and potential of cryptocurrencies in the broader investment landscape. The move is expected to encourage a more diverse range of investors to participate in the crypto market, fostering increased liquidity and stability.



This development aligns with the evolving narrative surrounding cryptocurrencies, moving them from the fringes of the financial world to a more mainstream and widely accepted asset class.

One notable aspect, in my view, is the anticipated rise during Bitcoin's halving event in early 2024, coinciding with investors' hopes for the potential approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF.

I believe that the approval of an immediate Bitcoin ETF holds significant importance for the cryptocurrency market, especially with the increased likelihood of approval in light of recent news. This is expected to fuel expectations of maintaining the current upward trajectory in the coming weeks. Confirming the importance of this stage in the market cycle, any current declines in Bitcoin prices are seen as opportune times for investors to capitalize and open buying positions.

Furthermore, delving into the emerging cryptocurrency market reveals clear signals that these digital assets are gearing up for the start of a major upward trend. They are currently within the first price wave of the market cycle, and I believe they have the potential to achieve returns that far exceed current market expectations.

I see what we are witnessing now as just the beginning of a long-term upward trend, signaling a promising future for the markets. With the digital asset market gaining new momentum, strategic investment decisions during this upward trend for cryptocurrencies become crucial. As alternative currencies prepare for a significant rise and the potential approval of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), there is an opportunity for investors to maximize returns by adopting pending market orders.

Currently, the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has gained 1.84% over the past 24 hours, reaching $1.42 trillion. Additionally, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have also seen significant increases, contributing to overall market gains.

It's worth noting that the price of Bitcoin has risen by 2.36% to reach $37,380.16 so far, while the price of Ethereum has increased by 2.13% to reach $2,062.84. Over the past thirty days, Bitcoin has experienced an increase of approximately 22%, with the latter rising by around 23%.

The factors mentioned above are expected to be a reason for the continuation of the upward cycle, paving the way for potential gains in the market. This raises the possibility of the crypto bubble returning to the spotlight, and if that happens, I believe it will be the last compounded upward wave for digital currencies before a collapse and possibly long-term disappearance.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,7.6425133,c47af62fc53ffacea51750fb659efa9f

GlobaleCrypto
, a leader in digital asset and cloud mining services, has announced new opportunities in Bitcoin mining, proving it to be highly profitable in 2023. This revelation is set to change the dynamics of earning through cryptocurrency.
 
Understanding Bitcoin Mining in the Current Landscape
Bitcoin mining, a process of using computational power to transact and secure the Bitcoin network, remains a vital component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This process involves miners verifying transactions, assembling them into ""blocks,"" and adding them to the blockchain, a task that requires solving complex computational puzzles known as proof of work. Successful miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins, making the endeavor highly lucrative, especially considering the current BTC/USD exchange rates.
 
The Profitability of Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin mining's profitability stems from its crucial role in maintaining the Bitcoin network's independence from centralized authorities. Every 10 minutes, miners confirm a block of transactions. The first to validate it earns a reward of 6.25 BTC, a significant sum given Bitcoin's current market value. However, the competitive nature of mining, driven by Bitcoin's value and the substantial rewards, necessitates significant investment in specialized hardware.

Binance Holdings Ltd. had such lax controls over cryptocurrency transactions on its exchange that terrorists, hackers and sanctions violators used it for years to move billions of dollars, US prosecutors said.
 
Binance and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges Tuesday, admitting they failed to take basic anti-money laundering steps that are the bedrock of government efforts to check the flow of dirty money worldwide. Binance will pay $4.3 billion, while Zhao will step down as CEO and pay a $50 million fine. 
 
The stunning turn of events means Zhao, the most powerful crypto figure in the world, faces prison time and will no longer run the industry's largest exchange. It comes after a multiyear investigation by federal prosecutors and the fraud conviction earlier this month of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the collapsed FTX exchange.
 
Employees at Binance were engaged in a wide array of misconduct, and many were aware of the consequences of allowing millions of illegal transactions, according to the Justice Department and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. 
 
'Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.' 
 
Because of those failures, the US said, Binance allowed the following to take place:
 
• The al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, used Bitcoin transactions to raise money for the Palestinian resistance. Hamas, which has been designated by the US as a terrorist organization, murdered more than 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7. Binance failed to file suspicious activity reports with the US about Hamas fundraising, according to FinCEN.
 
• Binance allowed Bitcoin transactions with other terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida and ISIS, FinCEN said.
 
• At least 1.1 million transactions valued at $899 million were conducted by people living in Iran, in violation of US sanctions, the company admitted.
 
• Exchange users in Cuba and Syria, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, engaged in millions of dollars in transactions in violation of US sanctions, Binance admitted.
 
• Binance users made $275 million in deposits from BestMixer, a crypto platform that helped obscure the digital money trail, the company said. Dutch authorities shut it down in 2019, saying it was 'probably used to conceal and launder the criminal flows of money.'
 
• Customers transferred $106 million in Bitcoin from Hydra Market, the Russian darknet marketplace, to Binance wallets between 2017 and 2022, the company admitted. US and German authorities seized Hydra's servers in 2022, calling it the world's largest and most prominent darknet market. It sold hacking software, fake IDs and illegal drugs such as heroin, cocaine and LSD.
 
• Binance addresses handled tens of millions of dollars in transactions involving 24 strains of ransomware, with names like SamSam, Satan and WannaCry. While the company worked with law enforcement when notified, it deprived authorities of critical information about those attacks, FinCEN said. In 2021, the US indicted three North Korean military hackers over WannaCry attacks.
 
• More than 1,000 transactions took place involving three marketplaces that dealt in child pornography and related material, FinCEN said. An administrator of one of those sites, Dark Scandals, was indicted in 2020. The site featured violent rape videos.

It appears that the markets may suffer from the return of negative sentiment in light of the return of regulatory concerns to the fore and renewed fears of another possible turmoil in the market. That was with the lawsuit filed by the SEC yesterday against the third largest crypto exchange, Kraken.

While the SEC brought a number of charges against the crypto giant regarding its unregistered work as an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency, in addition to charges of comingling investors' funds with the company's own funds.

The SEC also said that this unlicensed business deprived investors' funds of the necessary protection. This, in turn, prompted the Authority to file charges against the exchange related to failure to carry out internal control and record-keeping as required.

In the aftermath, the head of the authority's law enforcement division said that the exchange had preferred to make hundreds of millions of dollars rather than comply with the laws.

This lawsuit call brings to mind the lawsuits that Coinbase and Binance faced, in addition to the collapse of FTX and the lawsuits that it subsequently faced. These events, although different in some details, once again awaken fears about renewed widespread collapses that may occur in the market in the event of a renewed outbreak of panic among participants.

However, I believe that the giants of companies operating in this sector have already learned how to survive and maintain the necessary reserves to face any sudden withdrawals or panic outbreaks in such circumstances, and this may prevent such collapses from occurring on a large scale. This is what it looks like. So far.

In contrast, Kraken defended itself by saying that the authority did not report any fraud, manipulation, or loss of customer funds as a result of a cyber breach. The exchange also stated that the authority did not indicate a failure to maintain sufficient reserves and that it could not prove the loss of any client funds. Kraken appears to be seeking to allay any potential concerns among its customers as well as defend itself.

This lawsuit against one of the largest cryptocurrency companies has also prompted Congress, Cynthia Lummis, to renew the call to pass the legal framework that regulates this market, which clearly defines for the SEC what are securities and what are commodities, and this would stimulate more innovation. in the United States.

This is true, of course, and I believe that the continued regulatory concerns and the lack of a clear legal and legislative environment may remain an obstacle to the development of this sector and prevent further adoption of this technology, in addition to weakening investors' appetite to enter this very turbulent market until now.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,6.8177905,9abefb4be2fe06b37c50f1cd0ad8f9a7

In this study, we used a combination of AI-assisted analysis of social media discourse and collaboration with industry experts to delve into the key research needs associated with the Bitcoin mining industry. We identified primary threats, opportunities, and research questions related to the Bitcoin mining industry and its wider impacts, focusing on its energy use and environmental footprint. Our findings spotlight the industry's move towards increasingly greater energy efficiency and an emerging commitment to renewable energy, highlighting its potential to contribute to the coming energy transition. We underscore the transformative potential of emerging applications in the Bitcoin mining sector, especially regarding demand response, grid flexibility, and methane mitigation. We suggest that targeted research on Bitcoin can serve policymakers, private sector decision-makers, research funding agencies, environmental scientists, and the Bitcoin industry itself. We propose that filling key information gaps could help clarify the risks and benefits of Bitcoin mining by encouraging collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders and conducting research that provides baseline peer-reviewed evidence surrounding Bitcoin's production and impacts. A collaborative approach could help mitigate the risks and realize the benefits of Bitcoin mining, including potentially positive and substantive contributions in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.


 










 


Bitcoin, a decentralized open-source digital ledger, enables global peer-to-peer financial transactions [
1
]. Its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism rewards the ‘miner' who solves a cryptographic challenge with the right to create the next transaction block. Once validated by decentralized node operators, the miner receives bitcoin (lower-case bitcoin denotes the currency; upper-case Bitcoin denotes the protocol) as a reward, plus transaction fees collected for that block. The PoW consensus mechanism safeguards the ledger's integrity, creating a secure and immutable record of transactions. Attempts to falsify it are not only mathematically formidable but also extremely energy- and capital-intensive. Bitcoin miners are central to network security.
For newcomers to Bitcoin, several essential points are worth noting. Firstly, miners, ranging from individuals with a single computer to large-scale entities with thousands, provide computing power and security to the Bitcoin network. Secondly, tens of thousands of independent Bitcoin network node operators validate mining transactions, providing a balance of power between the compute and validation functions. Each node operator stores a copy of the globally distributed ledger, securing the network's integrity. Lastly, Bitcoin, distinctively decentralized, has no central authority or foundation and derives its power and security from its inherently decentralized design. 
As of November 2023, the Bitcoin network reached a computation capacity of >500 exahash per second (
https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc
 (accessed on 20 November 2023)), accounting for nearly 0.65% of global electricity consumption (
https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/comparisons
 (accessed on 20 November 2023). Despite its numerous and innovative benefits [
2
], Bitcoin's energy-intensive production has become a point of criticism [
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
]. Some policymakers [
8
] and parts of the public [
9
,
10
] equate Bitcoin's global energy demand and contributions to climate change, even though these two factors are not necessarily correlated should mining prove to support the transition to renewable energy. 
The foundation for informed Bitcoin policy decisions is currently limited, partly due to its nascent nature and partly due to conclusions drawn by researchers unfamiliar with Bitcoin's intricacies [
11
,
12
]. This underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive Bitcoin research program that spans environmental, applied, and social sciences [
13
]. The research should contextualize Bitcoin mining within the broader framework of energy production and socio-economic dynamics, catering to policymakers by providing high-level studies on Bitcoin mining's influence on energy systems and, as needed, in-depth case studies and modeling efforts. Much of the current knowledge resides with industry experts and experienced practitioners, so engaging them is crucial.
In this study, we explore research areas to enhance the understanding of bitcoin mining and its multifaceted impact on climate, energy systems, the environment, and society. Utilizing a twofold approach inspired by the horizon scanning field [
14
,
15
], our first step involved assessing a broad spectrum of publicly accessible broadcasts within Bitcoin's dynamic social media landscape. This discourse laid the foundation for AI-assisted identification and articulation of pivotal Bitcoin information needs and candidate research questions. Secondly, we collaborated with industry stakeholders to scrutinize the AI-generated research questions, add additional questions when necessary, and enrich the knowledge-building process. This paper aims to significantly contribute to an emerging Bitcoin research agenda that can help policymakers and other decision-makers make informed decisions and prioritize research needs.
Our study centered on identifying perceived threats and opportunities (‘issues') relevant to the Bitcoin mining industry and energy- and environment-focused policymakers. Our methodology involved:
Identification of Key Issues: We employed AI to extract prominent threats and opportunities related to mining from Bitcoin-oriented podcasts (this step replaced the solicitation of candidate research questions from the wider community in traditional key questions exercises).
Formulation of Candidate Research Questions: From these threats and opportunities, we further used AI assistance to develop a set of pertinent and compelling research questions (
n =
 180).
Consultation with Industry Experts: After a light-touch human review that further eliminated redundancies, we were left with 81 candidate research questions. We then engaged with experts from the Bitcoin mining, energy production, and support industries, inviting them to identify their priority information needs and engage in the manuscript review and editing process.
Our approach, engaging with seasoned industry professionals, helps to ensure high-level perspectives on the industry's information and research needs. Our participatory approach was preferred to traditional quantitative surveys, which likely would have garnered limited engagement. This strategy helped maintain focus on the key evidence vital for informed decisions concerning Bitcoin mining, as well as energy and environmental policymaking.
The Bitcoin-focused social media landscape is active and spirited, with a wide variety of interviews and discussions addressing topics such as mining, technological advance, and the broader societal impacts or Bitcoin mining and adoption. Our source pool of podcasts included interviewees ranging from high-profile senior executives to lesser-known but often very knowledgeable practitioners. Most of our content was derived from long-form interviews (
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24547774.v1
, accessed on 20 November 2023) for interview summaries and other Supplementary Materials).
We analyzed transcripts from 358 broadcast segments, amounting to 383 h of dialogue (
Figure 1
), at which point we reached a pre-determined cut-off date for analyses (to allow for the preparation of a short list of questions prior to a July 2023 workshop). These broadcasts, sourced from 59 broadcasters, afforded broad insight into the industry. While mining was a central theme, other Bitcoin-related subjects were also discussed. 301 out of 358 broadcasts occurred in the first half of 2023, so we captured current issues being actively discussed on Bitcoin-oriented social media.
Rapid advancements in automated AI-assisted podcast transcription services over late 2022 and 2023 have made the analysis of long-form interviews and panel discussions simple and economical. Moreover, with the recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering [
16
,
17
], complex parsing of transcriptions is now possible. Innovative use of LLMs opens up new possibilities for cross-cutting transdisciplinary research [
18
,
19
].
For each of the 358 broadcasts, OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 was tasked with identifying 10 AI-derived keywords, a concise summary, and the 10 most important threats and opportunities (‘issues') discussed in the transcription. Note that the scope of material that we drew on for this study—3580 issues—was far in excess of the level typical for traditional horizon scanning exercises [
20
]. The full list of 3580 issues and prompts are available in the Supplementary Materials of 
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24547774.v1
 (accessed on 20 November 2023). 
Initiating the threats and opportunities identification process necessitated the establishment of a research context and the creation of a research persona for GPT-4. The context specified that the analysis would extract information for subsequent use by researchers conducting synthesis research on Bitcoin mining. The persona was described as a ‘senior academic researcher and full professor, highly acquainted with Bitcoin, and possessing a PhD focused on the social and technical implications of emerging technologies.' This persona had a keen interest in aspects concerning Bitcoin's social, environmental, political, economic, and governance impacts, as well as issues relating to computer science, technical developments in Bitcoin and Layer 2, finance, and law.
We asked ChatGPT-4 to identify issues using the prompt: '…list 10 important threats and/or opportunities—the most important issues—you discovered in this content. These threats and/or opportunities may (1) impact on Bitcoin mining, technology, or adoption, or (2) be environmental, economic, social, or governance impacts arising from Bitcoin mining, technology, or adoption'. Note that we focused GPT-4 entirely on identifying issues that were discussed within the transcription text, not on its general knowledge. We wanted the AI to extract important issues and then generate ‘candidate' research questions based on those issues, mirroring the process in traditional key questions exercises, where a working group sorted and refined a pool of candidate questions supplied from the broader community. We requested the AI to summarize its internal rationale for its choices (
Table 1
).
To illustrate GPT-4's capability, we analyzed Peter McCormick's interview with Troy Cross and Shaun Connell from What Bitcoin Did (
www.whatbitcoindid.com/wbd619-troy-cross-shaun-connell
, accessed on 20 November 2023). They discussed US Bitcoin mining and energy policy. GPT-4 identified 10 issues—threats and opportunities—from the broadcast transcriptions and, in 
Table 2
, explains how they were selected. 
As of July 2023, neither GPT-3.5 nor GPT-4 could consistently and systematically sort issues due to restrictions on the context window size. Thus, we used a traditional text miner (QDA Miner version 5.0.11) to analyze the 3580 issues. Through keyword and phrase cluster analysis, we identified 21 themes, 10 of which were particularly relevant to mining. These 10 are detailed in 
Table 3
.
Keywords characterizing the 10 relevant clusters were input into GPT-3.5 for deeper analysis (3580 issues—the list of issues was >125,000 words in length). It recognized 239 subthemes across the 10 themes and proposed two research questions for each. From these, we selected 10–20 questions per theme based on the number of related interviews (
Table 4
).
Note that we used GPT-4 for all analysis of individual transcripts, but due to mid-2023 constraints in loading large datasets to ChatGPT-4 (all our transcription analysis was done prior to the release of Code Interpreter), we used GPT-3.5 for synthesis. These are two entirely different modeling exercises, so mixing models had no impact on the quality or consistency of transcription analyses, for which we relied on GPT-4. GPT-3.5 was perfectly competent for generating research questions using output from GPT-4's individual analyses. 
Chat-GPT-3.5 narrowed the pool to 180 important research questions across all 10 themes. A light-touch human review was used to identify further redundancies and opportunities for combining questions, which resulted in a final list of 81 questions in 11 topic areas. This procedure mirrored that used for some human working groups conducting key question exercises, where project leaders undertake a preliminary edit prior to bringing a list of candidate questions to workshop participants [see [
20
] (
Table 2
)]. 
We discussed the AI-generated research questions at an open Bitcoin industry workshop (Mining Disrupt, 26 July 2023, Miami, FL, USA). After the workshop, industry representatives reviewed the questions and contributed to the manuscript. Once the manuscript draft was complete, it was circulated among a wider group of industry participants for review. Contributors who provided substantive input during the preparation of the draft manuscript were included in this paper as ‘review and editing' co-authors.
In the material that follows, research questions identified by the AI are shown in tables, while the accompanying commentary for each section was developed by the co-authors. There was no obligation for co-authors to mention every AI-generated question nor to restrict themselves to questions in the tables. This level of freedom is similar to the freedom that breakout group participants have at in-person meetings. Participants in the key questions exercises are always free to accept or reject candidate questions or develop their own questions [
14
,
21
,
22
].
Our focus was on Bitcoin mining in this paper. We recognize that there are a variety of Bitcoin's impacts that are also important (e.g., the impacts on issues like financial inclusion and adoption, cybersecurity and crime, and macroeconomic and political implications), but those are beyond the scope of the current mining paper. 
This section explores questions pertaining to the complex interplay between Bitcoin mining and sustainable energy (
Table 5
). This kind of targeted research may help Bitcoin miners and policymakers make informed decisions on the optimal settings, locations, and terms for conducting business.
Bitcoin mining now holds significant influence in the energy landscape in some regions and is increasingly being used to monetize underused energy resources. As the Bitcoin network continues to grow, the industry will need to increasingly rely on lower-cost power to remain economically viable, particularly during bear markets when miners may face significant cash flow challenges. 
From a mining supply and demand perspective, low-cost electricity, the most important input in bitcoin production, enables producers to increase production levels and",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Branscum,Bratcher,Carson,Collins,Connell,David,Gronowska,Hess,Murray A.,Murray A.

Set a sell-stop at 37,500 and a take-profit at 38,445. Add a stop-loss at 36,400.

Bullish view

Bitcoin price surged to over $38,442 during the weekend, the highest point since April 2022. The BTC/USD pair retreated to a low of 37,260 on Monday morning, the lowest level since November 23rd. It has risen by almost 10% from the lowest point in November's momentum fades

Bitcoin price continued its bullish momentum even after the crypto industry went through numerous regulatory challenges. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Kraken, one of the biggest crypto exchange in the world.

The SEC alleged that the company commingled customer funds and operated as an unregistered securities exchange. In another regulatory setback, Binance reached a major settlement with the SEC. It agreed to pay over $4 billion and completely exit the American market. Changpeng Zhao, the company's CEO also agreed to pay $50 million and exit his role.

Analysts believe that the settlement is a positive thing for the industry since it removes one of the biggest challenges that has existed in the past few months. The settlement also means that Kraken and Coinbase could also decide to settle with the SEC.

Bitcoin's price action has coincided with the recent US dollar index (DXY) crash. The DXY index has plunged to $103.41, much lower than the year-to-date high of $107.35. Similarly, the closely-watched VIX index has also dropped to $13, the lowest point since 2020.

This price action is a sign that investors have embraced a risk-on sentiment as global inflation retreats. The most recent data showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) retreated to 3.2% in October.

Inflation likely retreated in November as the price of crude oil has drifted downwards recently. Brent, the global benchmark, has dropped to $80 while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) moved to 17/USD technical analysis

The 4H chart shows that the BTC/USD pair has formed an ascending channel in the past two months. It rose and retested the upper side of the channel on Sunday. The pair has now moved below the 50-period Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA). Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has crossed the neutral point of 50.

Therefore, the outlook for the pair is bearish, with the next point to watch being the lower side of the channel at 36,370. The stop-loss of this trade is at 38,445.

Analyst Predicts BTC Won't Fall Below $35,000 Ever Again",Samuel Edyme,2023-11-29 00:00:16,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-unbreakable-floor-analyst-predicts-btc-wont-fall-below-35000-ever-again/,newsbtc.com,"Renowned Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model creator, PlanB, has recently made a bold prediction about Bitcoin (BTC) that's captured the...","Controversial Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model creator PlanB has recently made a 
bold prediction
 about Bitcoin (BTC) that's captured the crypto community's attention.


Via his social media handle X, PlanB stated that Bitcoin's price would never plummet below the $35,000 threshold again. PlanB supported his claim with a chart illustrating Bitcoin's valuation trend about its intrinsic hash rate. According to PlanB, this relationship is a critical indicator of the 
digital currency's enduring value
.
 
Despite acknowledging potential black swan events or short-term market volatility, PlanB insists that based on the current fundamentals, particularly the cost of electricity ($/kWh) used in mining Bitcoin, the asset's market value is 'unlikely' to retract below the mentioned support level – 
$35,000
.


Mining And Market Arbitrage: A Key Factor


The crux of PlanB's argument lies in the unique arbitrage opportunity that exists between Bitcoin miners and everyday users. Miners, who invest heavily in electricity to mine the digital asset, and users, who typically purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency on exchanges, create a 
dynamic market environment
.


According to PlanB, this arbitrage might become even more 
pronounced
 with the advent of a potential launch of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US.




🚨BREAKING: Bitcoin valuation based on difficulty (hashrate) increased to $35k yesterday. IMO this could mean that, apart from possible black swans or short term volatility, based on $/kWh-arbitrage fundamentals … BTC will never go below $35k ever again. 
pic.twitter.com/JPLkXieQAP


— PlanB (@100trillionUSD) 
November 27, 2023


PlanB 
suggests
 that miners, equipped with specialized knowledge about the market and the actual cost of producing Bitcoin, might begin to demand a premium when selling the cryptocurrency. This shift could fundamentally alter the way Bitcoin is traded and its 
perceived value
.


The introduction of BTC spot ETFs, in particular, is expected to bring a new level of mainstream acceptance and investment into Bitcoin, potentially solidifying its price floor as predicted by PlanB.


Bitcoin Hash Rate And Market Dynamics


Delving deeper into the concept of Bitcoin's hash rate, it's essential to understand its role in securing the network and validating transactions. The hash rate basically measures the computational power being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain.


A higher hash rate indicates more robust security and efficiency in the network, often correlating with increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher asset valuation.
 
PlanB's analysis posits that Bitcoin's valuation will follow suit as the hash rate continues to rise, driven by technological advancements and increased mining activities. This relationship forms the basis of his prediction that Bitcoin will maintain a strong market position, unlikely to fall 
below the $35,000 mark
.

Currently, BTC is trading above $37,000, marking an increase of over $2,000 from the support level PlanB mentioned. Specifically, at the time of writing, Bitcoin's price stands at $37,605, reflecting a 2% rise in the last 24 hours.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis that the price was consolidating just below a long term high on increasing volatility , suggesting a bearish reversal. Overall, I saw the $38k area as likely to be pivotal.

Since then, the price briefly made a new high, but has continued its wide, bullish consolidation.

I see the technical picture as essentially unchanged – a strong rejection of any of the nearby resistance levels could be a good opportunity to enter a short trade which would have a chance of catching a major bearish reversal. On the other hand, a daily close above $38,000 could be a powerful long trade entry signal for trend traders.

I also see the support level at $35,661 as likely to give a strong bounce if reached today, so that could be interesting for shorter-term traders, or swing traders using pullback trading strategies .

Regarding the US Dollar, there will be a release of CB Consumer Confidence data at 3pm London time.

With the development of the 4th industrial revolution and its implementation, enormous changes are taking place at all levels of the systems. Technology is subject to change and renewal, and the day is not far off when paper money will be replaced by digital money.







The key element of the traditional economy that the anonymous creator of Bitcoin wanted to fix was money. In the modern world, national currencies, or fiat money, are printed by governments. They are also a centralized structure with known flaws. First of all, the value of money is determined by the actions and credibility of the issuer. In addition, fiat money is subject to constant inflation, i.e. depreciation.

Bitcoin is a decentralized system that operates on a software protocol and is based on the principle of direct exchange between users. It works without the involvement of any regulatory body or central bank, issuing coins and processing transactions is done collectively by the participants of the network. Thus, no one can control Bitcoin, block or cancel a transaction. However, anyone can join the network, use it for transfers, or develop Bitcoin code.

After a meteoric rise on October 12 from $26,750 to $34,667 on October 31, the price of bitcoin (BTC) has not stopped moving upwards. On the day Grayscale Investments met with the SEC about a bitcoin-ETF application, BTC rose from $36,500 to multi-day support at $37,400.

Can Bitcoin ever replace paper money in Azerbaijan ?

Today, in the global re-farming of the world and implementation of the 4th industrial revolution, technocrats, elites, and big companies of the West, attach significance to the introduction and creation of a centralised system of one Bank with a single currency for all in digital form at the global, world level. The introduction of digital currency has become very important after the emergence of Bitcoin. Western countries are a great example of how digital currency adoption will be handled in social and industrial circles. The European Union and its countries have already released a ready-made digitalisation system called CBDC.







Bitcoin will not replace paper money in Azerbaijan, as its transition marks a systemic reformation and consideration of the needs and requirements of society and the state, but there is a possibility that a digital currency like Bitcoin or CBDC will be introduced soon.

According to Taleh Kazimov, Chairman of the Board of the regulator, the Azerbaijani Central Bank has all the possibilities to introduce digital manat. Its introduction is hampered by the fact that the impact of digital currencies on financial stability and monetary policy has not been fully researched. Azerbaijan is studying by observing other countries with digital currencies.

""Of course, digital currency has certain risks that can affect the economy, including requiring a large number of electronic resources. It is encouraging that the Central Bank has all the resources and opportunities to introduce the digital manat, however, we are focused on modernizing and optimising the national payment system, and then we will start introducing innovations""

Why bitcoin is not very recognisable in Azerbaijan ?

Informativeness, social prosperity, and self-education, their importance in balancing will give knowledge to society in the use of technological and social benefits, and it is also significant for the state in preparing society for the transition to a common system of digitalisation.

In Azerbaijan, more than 90 percent of money turnover is still in cash. The use of payment bank cards in the country and its issuance to date there are about 9.4 million cards. A significant part of the population in the country uses cards for cashing in or out. Although the turnover of online commerce has also increased slightly during the pandemic, it remains very low overall.

Older and younger generations have a lack of understanding of the issue, reducing their informativeness. A possible approach is to educate and introduce it through tourism and immigration policies. Technological breakthroughs, as important for the realisation and implementation of a centralised digital currency system. A base for storing, processing, and transmitting data and its speed, are important attributes for the realisation of the task at hand.

Can Bitcoin ever gain dominance over the world's currencies ?

Leading up to the global events taking place in the world, great importance is being placed on technological advances in implementing the agenda of the new world government. The Middle East war as the Russian-Ukrainian war continued to create problems in the supply of commodity turnover. France's withdrawal from Africa left a trail of continuing waves of problems and reforms. Africa was the first to introduce the digital currency CBDC.

It is now becoming increasingly clear that Bitcoin can be a creation of individuals, and was launched as a 'normalisation' experiment to introduce the public to digital currency. Once this stage is passed, the fiat currencies of the world will be destroyed in a planned debt crash and then replaced by a government-approved cryptocurrency with all transactions and digital wallets tracked by the Western governments of the world.

Last year there was a collapse in cryptocurrency prices.

""Mass panic"" causes a $1 trillion collapse in cryptocurrency prices and a warning of a ""short squeeze"" after FTX's FTT goes into freefall, dragging Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Solana, Cardano and Dogecoin with it. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies fell sharply this week, taking billions of dollars out of the entire cryptocurrency market and pushing it below the long-awaited $1 trillion mark.""







During a recent European Parliament hearing, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said that the digital euro would not have the anonymity of cash, and then dismissed concerns that the government would use the digital euro to control what people can buy as a ""conspiracy theory.""

Lagarde has previously acknowledged that privacy is one of the main reasons for Europeans' concerns about the proposed European Union digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro. Despite this admission, she continues to insist that there will be no anonymity for users of digital euros and that they will never become as private as cash.

""Privacy is protected,"" Lagarde said. ""Not anonymity, but privacy. And we can address all the conspiracy theories that exist about this as if Big Brother is going to determine what you buy when you buy it, and how it should be restricted.""

Nigeria, with a population of over two hundred million people, has become the first serious global test bed for the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).

On October 25, 2022, a year after a nationwide referendum on the creation of CBDC in Nigeria in which 99.5% of citizens voted against the digitalisation of the currency, then President Muhammadu Buhari issued a decree that despite opposition from the majority of the nation, the financial revolution would happen anyway.







In December 2022, the Abuja government launched an all-out attack on cash. On 10 February 2023, about 80% of the $7.2 billion previously in private hands was in CBDC digital accounts, the poorer part of the population (more than half of the people) still had no bank accounts. Half the country was left with old, worthless banknotes.

On 16 February 2023, violent riots broke out in the country, resulting in casualties. Stripped of all their wealth, desperate and hungry people took to the streets demanding the restoration of paper money.

By the end of January 2023, transactions using the eNaira digital currency were running smoothly but were limited to the middle class - only about thirty-five to forty million people.

The problem was that the new money was nowhere to be found. Even today, when the central bank withdrew from the experiment, the supply of new cash did not even reach ten percent of Nigeria's total money supply.

Nigerians could not understand how the government planned to eliminate existing cash and issue new money just weeks before the general elections slated for 24 February 2023.

The situation of uncertainty and danger persisted for three and a half months until the inauguration of the new president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the former civilian governor of Lagos State. On 29 May 2023, about 108 days after the virtual elimination of cash, Tinubu reinstated the old currency, as well as the new eNaira and electronic eNaira.

What made him take this step? Was it influenced by the experiment's overseers from the IMF, the US Fed, or the WEF?

Today the specialists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan monitor the key trends in this sphere and study the best practices of leading international organisations and other countries, in particular, they actively cooperate with the Central Bank of Turkiye for further implementation of the most optimal mechanisms in Azerbaijan.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/28/A_3c138image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.7774315,144fa40c0bba5ba0971376c3c994624e

It captivates investors with its potential for high returns and its role as a trailblazer in the digital currency space. As BTC gains mainstream acceptance, diverse investment products have surfaced. They offer various avenues for investors to tap into this digital asset's potential.

For those new to cryptocurrencies, navigating this landscape can be daunting. CryptoMode aims to demystify the most popular Bitcoin investment products, providing insights into their workings, benefits, and risks.

Bitcoin can be bought and held as an investment and as a digital currency.

Over time, BTC has shown potential for significant appreciation in value, making it a potentially lucrative long-term investment. However, Bitcoin's price is highly volatile and can fluctuate widely, making it a risky investment. It requires a strong risk tolerance and patience from investors.

These online platforms allow individuals to buy, sell, or trade BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

They offer a range of investment products, like spot trading (buying/selling BTC at current prices), derivatives (financial contracts deriving value from Bitcoin's price movements), and margin trading (using borrowed funds to trade). These platforms provide access to real-time market data.

Investing through exchanges involves risks like market volatility and potential security breaches. Investors need to be cautious and well-informed.

ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges , similar to stocks. Bitcoin ETFs specifically track the value of BTC. They offer investors a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying it, providing diversification and ease of trading.

The risk profile of Bitcoin ETFs mirrors that of BTC itself, including price volatility and regulatory uncertainties.

These ETFs directly purchase and hold Bitcoin. The value of the ETF shares is tied to the current price of BTC. However, these vehicles struggle to gain regulatory approval in the US at this time.

Spot ETFs offer direct exposure to BTC's price movements and allow investors to participate in the market through a regulated investment product.

A spot Bitcoin ETF carries the inherent risks of BTC, including its volatility and potential regulatory changes that could impact its value.

These ETFs don't hold BTC directly but futures contracts on Bitcoin. These contracts are agreements to buy or sell BTC at a future date at a predetermined price.

They provide exposure to BTC price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly. They are often seen as a way to speculate on Bitcoin's future price.

Unfortunately, they introduce additional risks like the potential mismatch between the futures contract price and BTC's market price. There are also various complexities of futures trading to consider.

Each investment product offers a different way to engage with the Bitcoin market. Potential investors need to understand their unique features and risks before investing.

It adopted a Bitcoin investme","(MENAFN- eTrendy Stock) MicroStrategy, primarily known for its software analytics business, made a significant strategic shift in August 2020. It adopted a Bitcoin investment strategy. This decision led to the company purchasing substantial amounts of Bitcoin. As of the latest reports, MicroStrategy holds over $4 billion in BTC, with no inclination to reduce its exposure.

Michael Saylor, the company's CEO, spearheaded this strategy. It is motivated by believing in Bitcoin's scarcity and potential as an asset. MicroStrategy funded these acquisitions through a combination of strategies, including diluting company shares and leveraging the company's balance sheet. Doing so gives it the capacity to sell shares for liquidity if needed.

This aggressive investment approach has been successful for MicroStrategy as it has profited significantly from its Bitcoin holdings ​​. However, other companies have been more hesitant to follow MicroStrategy's lead. Since the first quarter of 2021, no new non-crypto companies have publicly announced Bitcoin purchases.

Several factors contribute to this reluctance:

There is the risk of negative publicity, especially given concerns about Bitcoin's energy consumption and the potential backlash from the public.Changing a corporate treasury strategy to include a significant investment in Bitcoin is unorthodox and presents various challenges.Some companies may be wary of being associated with MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, whose vocal and eccentric behavior might be off-putting for more conservative corporate leaders.There is concern about the risk of MicroStrategy becoming a dominant player in the Bitcoin market, potentially affecting its decentralized nature​​​​​​​​​​​​.



A Bold Gamble With Severe Risk Potential

Investing in Bitcoin also presents inherent risks that could deter companies from following MicroStrategy's example. These include regulatory uncertainties , as the legal status of cryptocurrencies remains a grey area in many jurisdictions.

There are also technological risks, such as the possibility of bugs in Bitcoin's protocol or vulnerabilities introduced through software updates. While these are unlikely to happen, the chance is not 0%.

Furthermore, relying on mining for network security increases the risk of a 51% attack . A hostile actor could control most of the network's hash power. Another risk is the potential emergence of more efficient and secure competitors to Bitcoin. However, the size and strength of the Bitcoin network make this increasingly unlikely​​​​​​.

While MicroStrategy's aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy has been profitable, it is a unique case that may not be replicable or suitable for other companies. The combination of internal funding mechanisms, market timing, and leadership conviction that fueled MicroStrategy's Bitcoin acquisitions is not easily replicated.

Furthermore, the risks associated with Bitcoin investment make it a complex and potentially risky endeavor for most companies. The future of corporate investment in Bitcoin remains uncertain.

It offers investors a chance to speculate on the anticipated launch of the ETF and includes a unique token burn strategy linked to the Bitcoin ETF's development.

The recently launched Bitcoin ETF Token presale allows investors to buy $BTCETF tokens before they are listed on exchanges. This article outlines an in-depth overview of the Bitcoin ETF Token presale while explaining how to buy the Bitcoin ETF Tokens through an easy step-by-step guide.



The Bitcoin ETF Token is a unique crypto project associated with the anticipated launch of the United States' first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund.

The project is set to reduce its total token supply by up to 25% through a dynamic token burn mechanism tied to five major 'milestones' in the Bitcoin ETF sector.

Currently, $BTCETF tokens are available in the presale phase for $0.0058 per token, appealing to early investors.

The presale has raised over $1.7 million in a few weeks, indicating investor confidence and high market interest. The $BTCETF includes a staking rewards system and a 5% transaction tax designed to incentivize long-term holding and contribute to the token's stability and growth in the market.

The Bitcoin ETF Token is one of the most promising new cryptos in its presale phase. This stage allows investors to buy tokens using Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), MATIC, Binance Coin (BNB), or even a credit card. Here's a step-by-step guide to buy Bitcoin ETF Tokens :

To buy $BTCETF during its presale, it's necessary to have a crypto wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens. A recommended option is MetaMask, a secure and free wallet available for both mobile and web browsers.

To start, visit the official MetaMask website to download and install the wallet. Once installed, open MetaMask to set a password for your wallet.

Writing down and securely storing your seed phrase is crucial, as it's key to recovering your wallet if needed.

During the presale, ETH/USDT crypto is exchangeable for BTCETF. If you don't own any crypto, many crypto exchanges allow you to buy ETH or USDT using various payment methods, including credit/debit cards and bank transfers.

After buying ETH or USDT, transfer them to your MetaMask wallet. It's worth noting that investors can also use MATIC or BNB to buy BTCETF, but tokens bought using these two cryptos won't be eligible for early staking rewards of over 140%.

Visit the $BTCETF presale site and choose 'Connect Wallet.' Then, select MetaMask and follow the on-screen instructions to confirm the connection.

Decide the amount of $BTCETF you wish to buy using ETH/USDT/BNB/MATIC. The platform will compute the matching $BTCETF amount, including transaction fees.

Click 'Buy $BTCETF Tokens' to complete the purchase.

The tokens bought in the presale are not immediately available. They become accessible to buyers after the token generation event.

Once the presale ends, buyers can return to the presale website and click 'Claim Tokens' to transfer them to your wallet.

Buyers can enter the Bitcoin ETF Telegram group for the latest updates on token availability.

The Bitcoin ETF Token is an emerging crypto on Ethereum gaining investor traction due to its unique incentive mechanism. Its reward system is aligned with the anticipated launch and approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs.

Bitcoin ETF Token recently launched a presale for its native token, BTCETF, priced at $0.0058 each at the time of writing.

This presale phase marks an early opportunity for investors to participate. It quickly raised over $1.7 million in just three weeks, showing strong community backing and investor confidence.

Early investors staking their $BTCETF can earn an APY of 139% at press time. This high yield shows the benefits for early participants, though it's expected to decrease as more tokens are staked.

Up to 25% of the token supply is dedicated to staking rewards. This allocation is spread over five years, reflecting the project's commitment to long-term growth and stability.

The structured staking rewards aim to provide significant returns for early and long-term staking activities.

The Bitcoin ETF token has a unique deflationary model aimed at preserving its long-term value by maintaining a limited supply.

BTCETF's deflationary strategy is designed to mirror and respond to the evolving landscape of Bitcoin ETFs.

Dynamic Token Burn System : The token burn process is unique in its adaptability, directly linked to significant events and developments in the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Each milestone burn is designed to gradually reduce the total token supply by 25% cumulatively.

The burn mechanism directly responds to significant achievements and advancements in the Bitcoin ETF sector. Token burn milestones and mechanism:



Trading Volume Trigger : When the BTCETF's trading volume exceeds $100 million, 5% of the total supply is burned.

First Spot ETF Authorization : Upon the approval of the first Bitcoin spot ETF, another 5% of the supply will burn.

Launch of the First Spot ETF : At the first Bitcoin spot ETF launch, 5% of the total supply is again burned.

AUM Benchmark : A burn of 5% of the supply is triggered when the combined Assets Under Management (AUM) for all Bitcoin ETFs exceed $1 billion. Bitcoin Price Milestone : When Bitcoin crosses $100,000, it leads to a further 5% burn of the total supply.

Transaction Tax Structure



Taxation Mechanism : There is a 5% tax on every transaction within the $BTCETF ecosystem. Deflationary Model Adjustment : As each milestone is achieved, the project's deflationary model adapts by reducing the tax impact by 1%.

According to the Bitcoin ETF whitepaper , the $BTCETF has a total supply cap of 2.1 billion tokens. Of these, 40% of the supply (840 million tokens) is reserved exclusively for the presale phase for early buyers.

Allocation for Exchange Liquidity and Other Purposes



Exchange Liquidity Provision : 10% of the tokens (210 million) are allocated to ensure exchange liquidity for smooth trading and market stability after the expected listings. Staking Rewards and Token Burning : The remaining 50% of the supply is equally divided between the dynamic token-burning mechanism and staking rewards. This ensures community incentives and contributes to the long-term stability of the token.

Presale Structure of $BTCETF



Phase-Based Approach : The presale is segmented into ten phases, each with a specific allocation and pricing strategy. Each phase offers 84 million tokens, ensuring a uniform supply throughout the presale phases. Pricing Strategy : Starting at $0.005 in the first phase, the price incrementally rises to $0.0068 by the final phase. This tiered pricing encourages early participation and gradually improves the token's perceived value. The presale is in its fifth stage at press time, with tokens priced at $0.0058 each.

The presale has a hard cap target of $4,956,000. It has already secured over $1.7 million in a relatively short period since its launch. Investors can buy $BTCETF tokens using cryptos like ETH, USDT, BNB, MATIC, or card payments.

Many crypto advocates have pursued a Bitcoin ETF's approval since 2013. However, the journey has been marked by regulatory challenges, given the complexities and grey areas at the intersection of financial regulations and crypto. Some major milestones:



Early Efforts and Regulatory Hurdles (2013-2017) : The initial proposal for a Bitcoin ETF came in 2013 from the Winklevoss twins, who envisioned an investment vehicle to make Bitcoin accessible to mainstream investors through traditional stock exchanges. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected this proposal in 201 , citing concerns about market manipulation, volatility, and the nascent state of crypto markets.

Incremental Progress and Diversified Approaches (2018-2021) : Despite early setbacks, the push for a Bitcoin ETF gained momentum. Various financial institutions submitted proposals, exploring different structures such as futures-based ETFs. In 2019 and 2020, the SEC continued to express concerns over market surveillance and investor protection. Breakthrough with Futures-Based ETFs (2021) : A significant milestone was achieved in October 2021 with the approval of the first U.S. Bitcoin futures-based ETF , the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. This ETF tracks Bitcoin futures contracts rather than spot prices, representing the SEC's cautious yet important step toward embracing Bitcoin-linked investment products.

Current Prospects for Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval

As of 2023, the crypto community remains optimistic about the approval of a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which would directly track the price of Bitcoin itself, offering more direct exposure than futures-based ETFs.



The potential approval depends on improved regulatory frameworks and mechanisms to address the SEC's concerns over market manipulation and transparency.

The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a massive moment, potentially steering us into a new era of institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin.

It would allow broader investor access, improved liquidity, and show a significant step in the maturation of crypto as an asset class. However, the timeline for such approval remains uncertain, contingent on evolving regulatory stances and market developments.

Investing in the Bitcoin ETF Token during its presale phase offers an exciting opportunity for potential upside and long-term benefits. Here are key reasons why this stage is attractive for investors:



Early Advantage : Those participating in the initial stage of the $BTCETF presale can get an immediate upside by the final presale stage.

Deflationary Mechanisms and Milestone Burns : The long-term supply reduction of $BTCETF, encouraged by the sell tax and specific milestone burns, is designed to continually diminish the total token supply. This decrease in supply, coupled with spikes in demand following positive news in the Bitcoin ETF sector, can increase the token's value over time.

Staking Rewards Incentive : The plan to introduce staking rewards for $BTCETF holders adds another incentive layer. This feature encourages investors to hold their tokens, further reducing market supply and potentially improving their value.

Anticipated Launch Impact : The launch of Bitcoin ETF Token can be significant. Unlike many tokens that face high selling pressure upon launch, $BTCETF is structured to mitigate this through a 5% sell tax. This tax discourages immediate selling, likely leading to a supply-demand imbalance that could sharply drive up the token's price. Uncharted Potential : Amid the ongoing developments in the crypto ETF space, Bitcoin ETF Token could be the next crypto to explode , potentially mirroring the explosive trajectories of successful cryptos in the past.

The potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by regulatory authorities like the SEC could significantly impact the crypto market. Such an event will likely attract billions of dollars into the sector, potentially triggering a massive increase in market value.

In this context, the $BTCETF coin is strategically positioned to capitalize on this scenario, offering an exciting buying opportunity for those looking to benefit from the growing crypto-ETF market.

To date, no 'spot Bitcoin ETF' has been launched in the United States. Additionally, linking significant token burns to regulatory milestones, such as the SEC's approval of a spot ETF, has yet to occur in the crypto domain.

This uniqueness presents challenges in accurately predicting the future price trajectory of the Bitcoin ETF Token.



However, our outlook for the $BTCETF remains positive. We anticipate a substantial increase, potentially by ten times or more, from its current presale price, especially after the final and fifth burn milestone is achieved.

The combination of a sales tax on transactions and the offering of staking rewards acts as a mechanism to limit the influx of new Bitcoin ETF tokens into the market.



This limitation is likely to create upward pressure on the token's price. Additionally, reaching significant milestones is expected to create buzz and positively impact the token's value.

The Bitcoin ETF Token is an innovative crypto project closely linked to the anticipated launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in the United States.



This project has set a strategic goal to decrease its token supply by up to 25% through five key milestones. The $BTCETF combines a sell tax and staking rewards to encourage long-term holding amongst investors.

For early investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity, the Bitcoin ETF Tokens are available for purchase at only $0.0058 per token in the ongoing presale phase.

The presale phase has shown impressive initial results, raising over $1.7 million in just a few weeks and generating strong investor interest and confidence in the project.

While this pans out, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) remain mostly correlated with Bitcoin. 


XRP, BNB Decoupling From Bitcoin


While rising de-correlation suggests that the market is maturing and becoming more sophisticated, secondary factors could make some of the top altcoins decouple and chart their courses away from the tight grasp of Bitcoin. 
 
Sharing 
data
 from Kaiko, a blockchain analytics firm, @cryptobusy on X notes that the correlation between Bitcoin, XRP, and BNB has been contracting in the last two months. Meanwhile, BTC, Dogecoin, and Cardano prices have been moving in sync despite fundamental factors of each project impacting price action over this period.

The drop in correlation indicates that altcoins are increasingly gaining more market share from Bitcoin. This drop in Bitcoin dominance happens especially whenever certain altcoins move independently and are not influenced by how Bitcoin trends. 


In most cases, like it has been the case in Q4 2023, a spike in Bitcoin prices triggers altcoin demand, lifting them as a result. Besides Cardano and Dogecoin, for instance, 
Solana (SOL)
 and Tron (TRX) are two altcoins that have been rallying and tracking Bitcoin.


Additionally, the drop in correlation could mean the altcoin scene is maturing, and more investors are keen on picking out projects that offer more utility, not just BTC proxies. With more investors, altcoins tend to be more liquid, drawing even more capital.


BNB, XRP, BTC Impacted By Fundamental Factors


Even so, there could be more that explains the decoupling, especially with BNB and XRP. Seismic fundamental events have impacted BTC, XRP, and BNB ecosystems in the last two months. 
 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for instance, is likely to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs filed by several heavyweights, including BlackRock and Fidelity, in the coming weeks. Hopes of the regulator authorizing these derivatives tracking spot BTC prices have catalyzed demand, lifting the coin to new 2023 highs.

Meanwhile, a United States court ruled in favor of XRP being a utility when sold to retailers. The case initially forced prices higher, but the coin tracked lower throughout late Q3 2023 and 2024, only steadying as BTC rallied. 


At the same time, BNB was negatively impacted by 
Changpeng Zhao
, the founder of Binance, resigning in November 2023. The Department of Justice also fined Binance with a $4.3 billion penalty as a settlement.

Bitcoin Rally May Restart If Stablecoins See Further Exchange Deposits


In a new 
post
 on X, Santiment discussed the trend in the supply of exchanges of various assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The '
supply on exchanges
' is an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating supply of the given coin currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
The below chart shows the trend in this indicator for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) over the past few months.




The data for the exchange supply of the different coins | Source: 
Santiment on X


Depending on what type of asset it is, the significance of the supply on exchanges can differ. In the case of volatile assets like Bitcoin, the supply being stored on these platforms may be considered the available selling supply of the asset, as one of the main reasons investors may deposit their coins to the exchanges is for selling.


Thus, when this indicator trends up for these cryptocurrencies, it's a potential sign that selling pressure in the sector is going up. The graph shows that 
Polygon
 has seen 0.7% of its supply move to exchanges in the past month, which could be a bearish sign for its price.


On the other hand, Bitcoin has observed withdrawals equivalent to 0.33% of its supply during the same period. Such a decline in the indicator can suggest that investors may participate in accumulation, as they are taking their coins off towards self-custodial wallets.


As for the 
stablecoins
, an increase in the supply on exchanges also suggests that investors wish to swap these tokens. This selling of stables, though, actually provides a buying boost to the volatile side of the market, as the investors may use these assets to shift into Bitcoin and others.


As the chart shows, both Tether and USD Coin saw the exchange supply rise between August and October. More specifically, USDT and USDC observed 3.54% and 0.72% of their supplies moving into these platforms, respectively. 'These transfers were the predecessor to the crypto-wide rally from late October to mid-November,' explains Santiment.
 
In the past month, however, 3.1% of the Tether supply has left these platforms, while the USD Coin has observed the metric move sideways. This would suggest that buying pressure has stopped rising, and the opposite may occur.


'After a cooldown, USDT & USDC returning to exchanges will be crucial to seeing market caps continuing to increase for a big final 5 weeks of 2023,' notes the analytics firm.


BTC Price


Bitcoin has registered some drawdown today as the asset's price has now slipped under the $36,800 mark.

Investors in the market anticipate approvals for Bitcoin","(MENAFN- Investor Ideas) Bitcoin price approaches an upward breakthrough, hovering around $37,600 early on Thursday. Investors in the market anticipate approvals for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested public comments on the application of the Franklin Templeton Exchange-Traded Fund filed on the stock exchange yesterday.

This comes in conjunction with significant Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges, based on data from cryptocurrency price tracking sites. The data indicates that approximately a billion dollars worth of BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges over the past week.

Bitcoin's external flows, marked by a significant shift away from exchange platforms, have historically triggered buying fluctuations at market lows in previous years. This supports the theory of a potential medium and long-term rise in Bitcoin prices.

Yesterday, the regulatory body stated that deciding on the approval of instant Bitcoin exchange-traded funds will take more time. However, the agency has now changed its stance on such projects, seeking a unified and appropriate opinion before issuing its decision. This has raised hopes for approvals of traded instant Bitcoin funds.

From my perspective, another incentive supporting the bullish hypothesis for Bitcoin's price is the increase in reserves for stablecoins. Approximately $15.23 billion of Tether is held in the top 10 USDT exchange wallets, indicating purchasing power and anticipated demand for Bitcoin.

I also anticipate the possibility of Bitcoin Spot ETFs receiving a single batch approval in January 2024. The total number of Bitcoin Spot ETF issuers has risen to 13, with the application of the Pando ETF by Pando, a European giant in traded investment funds.

Additionally, I believe that the delay in filing submissions and exchanging details with BlackRock's trading and markets division within the Securities and Exchange Commission may play a role.

While Ethereum's declines were slightly more, by approximately 0.85%, it is also trying to maintain levels above $2040. While the markets witnessed weak liquidity, especially in the last two sessions, with the American markets on holiday.

While we do not see what might stimulate more broad movements in the markets, whether on the upside or downside. However, the markets appear to have overcome the negative sentiment that came with the return of regulatory concerns to the forefront, whether after the lawsuit faced by the crypto exchange, Kraken, or after the conviction of the CEO and founder of the exchange Binance.

Instead, Bitcoin touched further record levels not seen from April 2022, at $38,400. It seems that the markets are still maintaining their positive sentiment, which is mainly fueled by hopes for the imminent launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs.

This positive investor sentiment also appears to have been reflected in the discount to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) net asset value shrinking to its lowest level since 2021 at 8%. This also comes with optimism about the possibility of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF.

In the news today, stable cryptocurrency technology may witness further adoption, this time with the initial memorandum of understanding concluded between the company issuing the stable currency USD Coin (USDT) and the giant financial group, SBI Holdings. The agreement aims to provide users and businesses with liquidity from the stablecoin and comes as a continuation of the issuing company's expansion in the Asian market.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,6.8535757,928740320471a430fd86166ccdd7078f

Bitcoin experienced a rally during the trading session on Friday, successfully breaching the crucial $38,300 level, and displaying promising signs of an imminent surge.

While the outcome remains somewhat uncertain, the prevailing market sentiment strongly suggests that Bitcoin is on the cusp of a rally. In the event of this materializing, the $40,000 level will be the primary target, characterized by its prominent psychological significance and historical importance.

However, in the interim, adopting a strategy that involves capitalizing on short-term dips appears to be the most prudent course of action for traders. This approach not only offers the advantage of acquiring Bitcoin at more favorable price points but also allows investors to gradually accumulate value over time. Beneath the current price levels, the $35,000 mark stands as a support zone, poised to attract a multitude of buyers in the event of a pullback. It's worth emphasizing that Bitcoin thrives in an environment characterized by low-interest rates.

Reinforcing this perspective, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average is converging toward the $35,000 level, further solidifying its status as the ""market floor."" This particular level will undoubtedly be the most critical point on the chart that traders should closely monitor. While Bitcoin appears to be well-positioned for an upward trajectory, it is crucial to acknowledge that volatility remains an inherent characteristic of this market, making cautious and strategic trading essential is Coming

Nonetheless, it's imperative to remain vigilant, as an upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for later this month could potentially introduce complications for Bitcoin. History has shown that tightening monetary policies tend to be unfavorable for Bitcoin's performance, which thrives under conditions of low interest rates. Therefore, it is advisable for traders to maintain a dual focus, with one eye on the Bitcoin chart and the other on the 10-year Treasury yield in the United States. Given the interconnectedness of these factors, it is prudent to expect heightened market turbulence in the near term.

In the end, the recent developments in the Bitcoin market are indicative of a determined push towards higher price levels. While there may be some inherent risks and potential challenges on the horizon, the prevailing sentiment suggests that Bitcoin is poised for further upward momentum. Traders and investors would be wise to exercise vigilance, utilize strategic approaches to navigate market volatility – in other words don't get too excited or aggressive, and remain attuned to the multitude of factors influencing Bitcoin's trajectory.

Bitcoin had a mixed performance during Wednesday's trading session, with market participants oscillating between bullish aspirations and concerns of potential overextension.

While many are eager to propel the cryptocurrency to new heights, there is a growing sense that a pullback may be on the horizon, and such a correction could be deemed a welcome development. In particular, a drop to the $35,000 mark is an enticing prospect, one that would inject a dose of health into the market's dynamics.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average has been making a determined ascent, poised to converge with the $35,000 level in the near future. Such a confluence of factors would undoubtedly present a compelling case for prospective buyers, thus meriting close observation.

Beneath the surface, the $30,000 level looms as another layer of support, although a descent to this threshold might rattle the nerves of some market participants. It is vital to recognize that the primary driver of Bitcoin's fortunes, especially in the eyes of institutional investors, revolves around the movement of interest rates in the United States. A decline in these rates could potentially provide a tailwind for Bitcoin, offering support as it navigates its path forward. However, it is undeniable that the cryptocurrency market's momentum has surged ahead of itself, prompting the need for caution.

What if we Just Go Higher?

A potential breakout to the upside would open the door to the formidable $40,000 level, a zone that is expected to unleash a formidable wave of resistance. The breach of this level could unleash seismic shifts in the market's landscape, thereby altering the status quo.

In the grand scheme of things, adopting a ""buy on the dips"" strategy appears to be the most prudent course of action. Chasing rapid price movements in the cryptocurrency market has proven perilous, given Bitcoin's recent $8,000 surge over just a few weeks. The presence of institutional players in the market has dampened the likelihood of seeing explosive 15% gains within a single day, unless underpinned by a massive transformation in the economic backdrop. Thus, exercising patience and seizing opportunities when the market presents value is the modus operandi in the Bitcoin arena.

Furthermore, keeping an eye on the bond market becomes paramount, as any indications of monetary loosening could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's ascent. In the current landscape, staying attuned to both market dynamics and broader economic trends in the bond markets will be crucial to sort out the next move.

Gold's historic highs and the surge in risk demand at the end of last week did not spare cryptocurrencies. Cryptos experienced impressive gains on Monday, but one cannot leave aside the weekend bull run as well. The crypto market capitalisation reached 1.55 trillion, adding 10.5% in seven days.

Bitcoin proved that the smooth uptrend since late October was just a long consolidation before a new upward spurt.

Bitcoin has added over 11.5% since Friday, surpassing $42K at one point on Monday. While Bitcoin is overbought on daily timeframes, this is not necessarily a reason for a correction. In this mode, the first cryptocurrency can move for many more days, drawing more and more layers of investors into FOMO. Technically, up to $46K is thin-air territory for Bitcoin, and price swings between $40K and $46K can be pretty wild.

Matrixport reiterated its forecast for Bitcoin to rise to $63K by April 2024

and

$125K by the end of next year. Among the reasons for the rally are halving; geopolitical, monetary, and macroeconomic factors.

Grayscale expects that the emergence of spot bitcoin-ETFs has the potential to reduce the supply of BTC in the market, which in turn will have a positive impact on the first cryptocurrency's rate. Halving in April will also reduce supply from mining companies.

DeFi and NFT activity is showing'tentative' signs of recovery from a two-year slump as the pending approval of spot bitcoin-ETFs has improved sentiment in the crypto market, JPMorgan noted.

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, which has been charged by the SEC, is going to fight the regulator and answer all complaints in court, the company's general counsel said. He said the authorities' accusations that'Kraken is a clearing house and a broker-dealer are completely made up.'

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, denied reports of illegal funding and ties to the TRON Foundation, HTX and Tron founder Justin Sun.

Meanwhile, Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has entered into an agreement with an unnamed bank for the sake of attracting large legal entity investors and eliminating counterparty risk. Binance is preparing the foundation for the launch of spot bitcoin-ETFs in the US, which many market players have been waiting for a long time.

On Sunday evening, spot gold prices surged to an all-time high north of $2,150. That capped a 16.5% rally since the start of the year. At the same time, the unit price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), tapped $42,000 for the first time in nearly 20 months. That put Bitcoin's year-to-date return at more than 153.0%.

Though BTC has obviously risen more steeply than gold throughout the year, due to its more volatile nature, its price appreciation has followed similar trajectories. MRP has long posited that gold and Bitcoin could very well be complementary assets in some situations, sharing very similar monetary qualities and the potential to benefit from similar trends . Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink lent credence to the ""digital gold"" narrative, stating that Bitcoin is ""digitalizing gold"" and ""could revolutionize finance."" This was a massive stamp of legitimacy, considering BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, responsible for $9 trillion AUM in Q1 2023.

Fink went on to add that ""Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you're in - let's be clear, Bitcoin is an international asset, it's not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative."" BlackRock is one of the asset managers currently in the running to launch the U.S.'s first spot-backed Bitcoin ETF , a race that MRP has highlighted in detail throughout this year.

One example of the Bitcoin-gold relationship played out earlier this year during the U.S. banking panic that played out between March and May - culminating in three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history. As trust was lost in banks throughout that period, investors apparently poured assets into Bitcoin and Gold to store their value and keep it remote from the next potential bank collapse. These commodities' values shift constantly in Dollar terms, but both are always fungible - one unit of either Bitcoin or Gold is always equal to another unit of the asset. If investors take custody of their gold or BTC, they can eliminate the counterparty risk that a bank may pose since Bitcoin is always stored on an immutable blockchain ledger, and physical gold can be stored securely as well.

Ownership of Bitcoin does not take the form of an IOU like a bank account; it is a cryptographically-secured bearer asset that can be stored in any amount at little to no marginal cost. It can be sent anywhere on the network across the world at any time with full settlement in minutes. Portability and infinitely scalable storage is one advantage that Bitcoin carries over gold, as the costs to securely move or store BTC does not increase based on the amount of the asset that is being transferred.

Essentially, because Bitcoin has no mass, one BTC or one million BTC can be moved with identical speed and security and at the same low cost. Obviously, storing or transferring one million ounces of gold (equivalent to 62,500 pounds of mass) relative to one ounce would incur much greater costs and risks.

Another key difference that MRP has previously highlighted relates to the nature of scarcity: The gold miners' resources are relatively scarce, whereas the Bitcoin miners' resources are absolutely scarce. Though there is some feasible limit to how much gold there is in the world, nobody knows where that limit actually is, given each individual's necklace or gold stash can't be accounted for and new, previously unknown deposits are discovered semi-regularly.

In June 2022, for instance, Reuters reported about 31 million tonnes of gold ore were newly discovered in Uganda, with up to 320,158 tonnes of refined gold being extractable . That is a significant development for the long-term supply of gold, considering this discovery alone could potentially yield 53.3% more gold than all of the gold mined throughout history, which the World Gold Council pegged at 208,874 tonnes . Again, that is only an estimate, and nobody can feasibly calculate how much gold has actually been produced and is in circulating supply. This is not the case with Bitcoin. Not only can it be known with absolute certainty that there will only ever be 21 million BTC mined, but it can also be easily verified that as of 12:30 pm UTC on December 4, 2023, there were exactly 19,560,881 BTC in circulating supply.

The difference in relative and absolute scarcity also plays out in how much new supply of each resource is produced. The primary driver of gold output will be the market price. Simply put, when gold prices rise, gold miners will typically accelerate the production of gold to sell more at a higher price. The issue for miners is that the introduction of greater supply at an accelerated pace will likely be one of the factors that end up extinguishing the higher prices that were created by strong demand conditions. This same scenario could be projected onto the producers of copper, wheat, oil, and many other commodities. The issuance of Bitcoin, on the other hand, is programmatic and not controlled by any suppliers. Rather, it is controlled by a network protocol and mathematics that dictate an immutable schedule of distribution.

The similar trajectory that Bitcoin and gold have followed recently is largely related to shifting monetary policy at the Federal Reserve and its impact on the U.S. Dollar (USD), which traditionally correlates inversely with both of the commodities. In particular, the Fed's series of rate hikes that have sent the upper limit of the benchmark Fed Funds rate to its highest level in over two decades appears to have come to an end. In fact, CME's FedWatch suggests that rate cuts are now being priced in by futures traders as soon as March.

According to FedWatch data, there is now a 59.8% probability that at least one rate cut will trim 25bps from the benchmark overnight rate by March . A halting, or even a reversal, of the hikes that have helped the Fed tighten monetary policy in the U.S. would have a significant impact on USD's value relative to other currencies. When interest rates rise in the U.S., the higher yields can attract investment capital from investors abroad who exchange assets in non-USD currencies for Dollar-denominated investments. This demand, in turn, raises the value of the Dollar compared to other currencies. In a similar way, if rates are to hold steady or even begin to fall, that can cut the appeal of the Dollar.

It was all the way back in our August 2022 Viewpoint, The FX Timebomb , that MRP noted the Dollar was likely on the verge of a downturn, as the Fed was rapidly approaching what we termed ""peak hawkishness""; the point at which rate hikes reached their maximum size and frequency. We wagered, from that point on, the central bank's rate hike regime would gradually reduce the size of rate hikes from 75bps at their largest to 50bps and then, eventually, just 25bps.

Further, these hikes would become less frequent until they ceased altogether - likely the state of affairs we have now reached with just one hike in the past four FOMC meetings. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hit a more than 20-year high north of 114.0 that September, prior to retreating. Though we did witness a rebound in the Dollar from lows under 100.00 earlier this year, it has not gotten anywhere near its 2022 high and now sits near 103.5 as of this morning.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,8.844554,92e30b0c50e3a125dfbd8841c6dbeb3d

The rise of BTC is further buoyed by active trading in Ordinals: data from Dune Analytics shows that on December 3rd, the daily trading volume on mainstream platforms for Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions rose to approximately $15.94 million, a more than 200% increase from the recent low of $4.94 million on November 26th.
 
 
Despite skepticism around Bitcoin Ordinals, such as the lack of smart contracts and high transaction gas fees, the enthusiasm of the Ordinals community remains undeterred. 
 
The development of Ordinals, much like the evolution of Bitcoin itself, demonstrates that what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
 
In this context, SVARGA, a new experiment on the Bitcoin network's Ordinals, has garnered widespread attention. 
 
The term SVARGA, like the commonly used 'Avatar' in the metaverse, is derived from Hinduism, meaning 'the heavenly abode of the gods.' 
 
However, SVARGA is more than just an NFT issuance project on Ordinals; it represents a new direction in the NFT domain — transforming traditional PFP NFTs into more interactive and personalized Avatars.
 
Avatar Assets: Pioneering a New Dimension in NFTs
 
SVARGA
 has created unique Avatar assets for over 170,000 PFP NFTs across multiple public blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, and BTC Ordinals. Each Avatar asset is not only a deep extension of the corresponding PFP NFT but also serves as a user's avatar for crossing into the metaverse, offering a richer and more interactive digital experience.
 
Technical Innovation: From Metadata to Animated Avatars
 
Differing from traditional NFT projects, SVARGA employs a unique method to create these avatars. 
 
Designers first gather Metadata from diverse sources to ensure the uniqueness of each NFT. 
 
They then use this information to create a full-body image matching the original NFT, which is then transformed into Spine skeletal animation. 
 
This approach not only enhances the visual appeal of the NFTs but also increases their interactivity and application scope.
 
A New Identity in the Metaverse: Beyond the Boundaries of Games
 
SVARGA's Avatar assets, as innovative digital assets, play a role in various chain games and metaverse platforms. 
 
From games to social interactions, these avatars offer a new way for users to express and experience their digital identities. 
 
With the community's continual expansion, more games and applications are expected to join the SVARGA ecosystem.
 
The Value Capture about $SVGA
 
Bored Ape Yacht Club, a benchmark in Ethereum and the broader PFP NFT era, was propelled by Yuga Labs, shaping the market trend towards PFP-centric NFTs. 
 
The next wave in NFTs? Yuga Labs pointed towards 'Metaverse + Chain Games.' 
 
However, the limited adoption and high entry cost of 3D devices have hindered scalability. SVARGA aims to offer a different approach: by the 'PFP + $SVGA = Avatar' paradigm, creating a new 'Metaverse + Chain Game' experience for the entire NFT community, bringing new vitality to the digital asset ecosystem.
 
$SVGA: Capturing Value in a New Chapter of BTC NFT Narrative
 
The Avatar assets provided by SVARGA open up new possibilities for interaction within the metaverse, making SVARGA a significant player in this domain and offering unique ecological value to $SVGA holders. 
 
As more applications and games join the SVARGA ecosystem, the market potential of $SVGA is expected to grow. 
 
Through continuous interaction with developers, artists, and users, SVARGA is building a diverse and sustainable ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for the project's long-term value and market position, making $SVGA a value captor in the ecosystem.
 
A novel BRC-20 staking method: secure, trusty, and low GAS consumption
 
As a pioneering project on Bitcoin Ordinals, SVARGA sets a new precedent for the development of Ordinals NFTs and introduces a novel staking method for BRC-20. 
 
The slow growth of the BRC-20 DeFi ecosystem on the BTC network, mainly due to the absence of smart contracts, has been a hurdle — even though community proposals like BRC-30 sought to expand staking methods. 
 
Two main issues contribute to this:
 
1) The absence of smart contracts means trust-minimized staking isn't feasible, requiring users to transfer BRC-20 out of their wallets, creating a trust gap.
 
2) The BRC-20 mechanism, requiring 'inscription engraving' and 'inscription transfer' steps, leads to high Bitcoin network Gas levels, deterring even trusted third-party users due to the high cost of staking.
To address this, SVARGA introduced a new staking scheme: users don't need to transfer their $SVGA; maintaining a wallet balance above a set amount is considered staking. 
 
After staking, users receive an Avatar WhiteList. 
 
This WhiteList, homogeneous within the same NFT series, allows NFT owners to inscribe corresponding Avatar assets. 
 
This process keeps assets in the user's wallet, resolving safety and trust issues. 
 
Moreover, on-chain interaction only occurs when inscribing new assets (Avatar assets), significantly reducing transaction friction.
 
The Future: No More Isolated Data Islands
 
At the convergence of digital assets and the metaverse, SVARGA's Avatar assets represent a new form of NFT and initiate an era of interconnectedness between chain games and metaverse platforms. 
 
The digital world of the future will not be isolated islands, but an extensive, interconnected ecosystem.
 
SVARGA's Avatar assets, as users' avatars in this vast digital universe, will become bridges across different chain games and metaverse platforms. 
 
Whether on the Bitcoin network, Ethereum, or other public chains, these Avatar assets will grant users a new identity, allowing them to seamlessly traverse various virtual worlds and enjoy diverse gaming and social experiences.
 
This cross-platform identity and asset circulation not only greatly enhance the utility and interactivity of NFTs but also bring unprecedented connectivity and dynamism to the entire digital asset domain. 
 
Driven by SVARGA, we will witness the birth of a more open, interconnected digital world, a truly boundless metaverse. 
 
Perhaps, SVARGA is the key to unlocking this island-free digital world.

Bitcoin, the most valuable and energy-consuming cryptocurrency, has recently been at the center of a heated debate over its environmental impact. This controversy has caught the public's attention, prompting us to investigate the energy consumption of Bitcoin. In this paper, we have conducted a review of the literature on various aspects of Bitcoin mining, including its mechanisms, energy consumption, mining sites, and the potential for renewable energy use. Our findings reveal that the power consumption of Bitcoin is bound to increase with the continued adoption of the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Nonetheless, the growing availability of affordable renewable energy sources worldwide brings hope that Bitcoin mining will shift towards cleaner energy in the near future.

Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin in 2008 and has recently gained a lot of public attention due to its skyrocketing price in 2021. Unlike traditional currencies and payment systems, Bitcoin allows transactions to occur without the need for a third party. The Bitcoin network is supported by nodes in a P2P format distributed globally. To ensure the integrity of transaction data, all virtual currencies require a consensus algorithm, and Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW) based on cryptographic hash functions, which require a large amount of computing resources.
Given the growing interest in Bitcoin's environmental impact, this paper aims to consolidate existing research on Bitcoin mining and energy consumption from various sources such as journals, technical reports, and conference presentations. While many research papers have focused on blockchain technology and mechanisms, we summarize all concepts related to Bitcoin mining and energy consumption for readers interested in the topic.
This paper covers various aspects of Bitcoin mining, including cryptographic hash functions, PoW, proof-of-stake (PoS), distribution of mining sites globally, Bitcoin energy consumption, renewable energy and Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin mining in China, and Bitcoin mining and renewable energy in Texas USA. While technical aspects of blockchain are not discussed in detail, the concepts related to Bitcoin mining are covered comprehensively.
The main contribution of this paper is to provide a single survey summarizing the concepts of mining and providing practical technical details, saving readers time and effort in their investigation of mining and its impact on the environment. This review summarizes the current literature on the following key aspects of Bitcoin mining: the consensus mechanism of proof-of-work, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of mining, the geographical distribution of mining operations, and the potential for renewable energy sources.
Studies were selected through searches on Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore using relevant terms like ‘Bitcoin mining', ‘energy consumption', and ‘renewable energy'. Criteria for inclusion were papers published from 2015–2022 in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. The literature was evaluated based on factors like rigor of analysis, sample size, recency, and impact.
The authors found that China, which accounted for a significant share of the world's Bitcoin mining before July 2021, had introduced renewable energy sources such as hydropower and solar power in the areas where mining was active before the ban. All studies suggest that Bitcoin's energy consumption is increasing each year. However, the authors note that renewable energy, which is cheaper than fossil fuels, is increasingly available, and clean Bitcoin mining using renewable energy can be expected in the future.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2
 summarizes the latest trends in Bitcoin, the history of mining, and introduces the environmental implications of Bitcoin mining. 
Section 3
 explains the mechanics and principles of the hash functions needed for PoW. 
Section 4
 explains how the consensus algorithm PoW works. 
Section 5
 explains PoS, an alternative consensus algorithm to PoW. 
Section 6
 discusses the distribution of Bitcoin miners and energy consumption in detail. 
Section 7
 discusses renewable energy and its availability, as well as the impact and background of the Bitcoin mining ban in China. The final section provides a conclusion to the paper.
Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, continue to attract attention from people all over the world. The price of Bitcoin was less than 
$
1 in 2010 but hit a new high of 
$
68,000 in 2021 [
1
]. Blockchain technology posts all transaction records to the transaction ledger at regular intervals. The data is stored in a distributed way across the internet and all transactions that occurred during the period should have consistency. Miners validate transactions, store and broadcast them to the blockchain. By contributing to the system, miners can receive 6.25 BTC for incentives in 2023. The initial mining reward was 50 BTC per block in 2009. However, Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and the mining reward becomes halved roughly every 4 years. It was reduced to 25 BTC in 2012, then 12.5 BTC in 2016, and 6.25 BTC in 2020. This halving of rewards will continue approximately every 4 years until the total supply reaches 21 million [
2
]. Satoshi [
3
] stated that the incentive was for nodes to support the network and that the network initially distributed Bitcoins to the community. Although other cryptocurrencies that use proof-of-work consensus algorithms have appeared, Bitcoin miners accounted for more than 80% of the mining fees paid by the major proof-of-work Blockchains [
1
].
In order to be competitive in Bitcoin mining, miners need powerful hardware and much electricity. For hardware, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC are used intensively among miners [
4
]. Initially, Satoshi might expect miners to use the CPUs that every computer has, but as time went on, miners discovered they could gain more mining power from GPU, mainly used for PC gamers. Although mining with GPU is no longer competitive in Bitcoin mining, the market value of GPU grew significantly from 2018 to 2021 [
5
].
According to Bedford Taylor [
6
], after the appearance of mining software, Python OpenCL for GPU in October 2010, the first open-source FPGA Bitcoin miner implementations were brought in June 2011. FPGA mining has some advantages, such as higher performance and a better cooling system than GPU mining. In 2013, Canaan Creative (Beijing, China) released the first set of ASICs, which stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit for Bitcoin mining [
7
]. Since then, it has been difficult to win the mining competition with ordinary computers. Serious Bitcoin miners invest heavily to prepare many ASICs. Choosing efficient hardware is also essential when it comes to energy consumption. If all miners continue to use their CPU hardware for mining, Bitcoin mining will consume more energy than combined in the United States and China [
8
].
Back in early 2010, it was possible to mine on a home with an ordinary PC. However, with the advancement of mining machines equipped with ASICs and the increasing difficulty of mining calculations, it became almost impossible to make a profit from solo mining at home. Miners no longer make profits alone, and thus, they join the group called the mining pool. Miners participate in the pool to find blocks together via a mining pool. After they successfully find a block, they split the rewards among the participants in proportion to their contribution. Proportional and pay-per-share are the two simple reward systems. In a propositional way, when the pool finds the block and receives a reward, the reward is distributed among the miners in proportion to the miners' shares during the round. Pay-per-share, participants receive the reward immediately after submitting shares regardless of the finding of blocks. The operator obtains all the rewards for blocks found by the entire pool [
9
]. 
Before we discuss Bitcoin mining and environmental issues, we need to consider the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is an international framework for post-2020 climate change and successor to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The long-term goal is to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels and limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius [
10
]. One of the most revolutionary aspects of the Paris Agreement among climate change agreements is that it is a framework that requires all participating countries, including developing countries, to reduce their emissions equally. Countries need to report the actions and mitigation progress against climate change from 2024 [
11
]. They are supposed to verify the contribution of each other.  68% of the world's total emissions are accounted for by a small number of countries around the world [
12
]. Since those countries are economic powerhouses, they value international credibility, and hence countries need to deal with Greenhouse gas emissions seriously. 
Energy consumption is not equal to greenhouse gas emissions, but Bitcoin technology does consume a lot of energy. Cambridge estimates 124.22 TWh on 7 December 2021, more than the Philippines and Kazakhstan [
13
]. Mora et al. estimated Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2 degrees Celsius [
14
]. The study is controversial in some aspects. First, the hardware for Bitcoin mining keeps updating, which enables miners to process efficient mining with low power consumption compared to old hardware. Second, the study did not consider the rapid growth of renewable energy usage. China, which dominated Bitcoin mining in 2017 [
15
], is accelerating its move toward renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. As for the numerical targets by 2025, the plan calls for an 18% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions per unit of GDP and a 13.5% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP [
16
]. 
After the Chinese government made it clear in May 2021 that it would tighten its control over Bitcoin, local governments began shutting down mining sites [
17
]. As a result, the situation surrounding Bitcoin mining has changed.
The concept of cryptographic hash functions is an integral part of Bitcoin itself and the mining process. In the Bitcoin network, the cryptographic hash function can be used to detect changes in transaction data. If someone tries to rewrite the transaction data, it will be noticed by someone who has verified the hash of the rewritten data [
18
]. As Yasuda and Sasaki [
19
] suggested, the cryptographic hash function has three features that keep it secure. First, collision resistance: it is hard to find two different inputs that have the same hash. Second, pre-image resistance: it is difficult to find the input from the hash value. Third, second-pre-image resistance: given an input and a hash value, it is difficult to find a different input that outputs the same hash value. Thus, the cryptographic hash function is a one-way function, and the only way to find the input value of a hash function is through brute force. This is why the proof-of-work algorithm for Bitcoin mining requires a great deal of computing power. Bitcoin uses a hash function called SHA256. The SHA256 compression process is illustrated in 
Figure 1
.
Figure 1
 explains the mechanism of SHA256 for the compression process. First, initialize the variables a through h, making each the same as the current hash value. In the next step, a compression loop is performed 64 times to mutate the values of a to h [
21
].
Developers use various mining algorithms in other cryptocurrencies such as Scrypt, EtHash, X11, and CryptoNight [
22
]. Mining efficiency varies depending on the hashing algorithm used by the cryptocurrency [
23
].
A paper published by Landauer in 1961 showed the principle that a logically irreversible transformation of classical information requires the consumption of a minimum of (kT ln 2) joules [
24
]. Narayanan et al. referred to Bitcoin mining and Landauer's principle [
20
]. In other words, the hash function used in Bitcoin mining is irreversible, so energy consumption is inevitable in Bitcoin mining [
20
].
Miners who contribute to the verification of transactions in the blockchain will be given incentives. The verification is achieved by continuously assigning nonce (number only used once) to a hash function, repeating the operation, and looking for a number where the resulting hash is equal to or less than a given target value [
25
]. O'Dwyer and Malone use the following equation to describe the task of finding the nonce [
26
]. where 


B


 represents the previous transaction, 


N


 is the nonce value, 


T


 is the target and . is the concatenation operator. 


H


 is the Bitcoin hash function: SHA256.
Without miners, new transactions are not added to the public ledger, and Bitcoin cannot function. The Bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of mining a range of nonces so that a new block is added every 10 min [
27
]. The reason why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use protocols such as proof-of-work is to prevent double-spending. Legal currencies have sort of fraud prevention technologies that can be visually verified,",Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY),449,science,CH,en,"Han,Tomatsu,Wenlin Han,Yusuke Tomatsu",https://pub.mdpi-res.com/blockchains/blockchains-01-00007/article_deploy/html/images/blockchains-01-00007-g001-550.jpg?1701929874,False,@MDPIOpenAccess,8.502959,7a372a8fb9314035e97b623904ce987f

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis last Thursday that I would look for long trades in Bitcoin, with the market environment currently supporting such risk-on trades.

One approach could be going long after a daily close above $38,000 or the next resistance level at $38,659.

This was a great call, as the price has continued to advance firmly to higher and higher 18-month highs and is now well established above $40,000.

When the price of anything is breaking strongly on healthy volatility with firmly bullish daily candles to new long-term highs, it is worth taking notice and trying to come along for the ride with a long trade. The bullish environment gets a tailwind from the strong risk-on environment, with Gold notably reaching a new all-time high today as well.

Technically, we have just seen the price touch and retreat from the nearest resistance level, which is shown within the price chart below at $41,107. It is too early to reach much into that, but we may be due a bearish pullback now.

I see the price as likely to make higher prices over this week, so it would make sense to look for new long trades either on significant bullish breakouts, or on retracements to support levels and bullish bounces at these places, such as $40,907.

There is nothing of high importance scheduled today regarding the US Dollar.

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis two days ago that the price was continuing its wide, bullish consolidation. I was correct about this, but the levels I have were not useful.

The wide bullish consolidation is continuing, with the price briefly making a new 18-month high yesterday but failing to hold on to any meaningful gains.

I thought that it would take a daily close above $38,000 to trigger a truly strong bullish move and that seems to have been a good call as we have not had a daily close above that level in recent days.

Due to the long-term bullish trend and the bullish short-term price action, I will look for long trades in Bitcoin, with the market environment currently supporting such risk-on trades.

One approach could be going long after a daily close above $38,000 or the next resistance level at $38,659.

I also see the support level at $37,316 as likely to give a strong bounce if reached today, so that could be interesting for shorter-term traders, or swing traders using pullback trading strategies .

In early trading in Asia, the dollar gained ground against the yen, reaching 147.23, supported by a slowdown in core inflation in Tokyo, which exerted downward pressure on the Japanese currency. Simultaneously, the euro approached a three-week low, reaching USD1.0840, following its performance on Monday. The dollar index also approached its highest level in over a week, registering 103.59 in the latest readings.



Analysts attribute the dollar's resurgence in part to a halt in the intense selling observed in recent weeks. November witnessed the dollar index's largest monthly decline in a year, with a nearly three percent drop. The current rebound reflects a shift in market sentiment and a pause in the bearish trend that prevailed in the preceding weeks.



The British pound exhibited a modest increase of 0.08 percent, reaching USD1.2642. However, it remained somewhat below its recent three-month highs. Similarly, the New Zealand dollar retraced slightly from its four-month peak, settling at USD0.6173 in recent transactions.



The Australian dollar maintained its position at USD0.6620 ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's upcoming interest rate decision. Market expectations lean towards the central bank maintaining unchanged interest rates in the upcoming decision.

A much-anticipated US approval of wider bitcoin trading has helped the world's biggest cryptocurrency reach 20-month heights, risking however pain for new investors unaccustomed to its volatility.

Bitcoin this week reached above $44,000 for the first time since April last year, yet still remains far from a record-peak of almost $69,000 in 2021.

The recent surge has been driven by speculation around the creation of a so-called exchange-traded fund for the asset, which would directly track the price of bitcoin.

Spot bitcoin ETF would allow more of the general public to invest in the cryptocurrency without having to directly buy it.

""The introduction of bitcoin ETFs has the potential to improve market accessibility for institutional and non-professional investors, by providing (them) with a regulated path,"" Jeff Billingham, director of strategic initiatives at crypto group Chainalysis told AFP.

-New investors -

While bitcoin and rival digital tokens are attracting new younger investors, the Pew Research Center in March reported that overall, only 17 percent of US adults had invested in or used cryptocurrency.

This was largely unchanged compared with the previous two years.

When looking at young adults, they appear to hold a greater interest in cryptocurrency compared with traditional investors, according to French data.

A total 54 percent of new retail investors in France own cryptocurrency compared with 25 percent of traditional ones, according to a study published last month by French financial watchdog AMF.

Simon Peters, market analyst for eToro, said that while he could not comment on rival platforms, his company has witnessed a recent ""uplift in crypto activity"".

It appears some investors have not been put off by recent scandals within the sector, notably the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX empire, which sent prices crashing at the end of last year.

""There are no more scandals in crypto than in traditional finance,"" said Thomas, a 36-year old worker in logistics.

The problem lies in a ""professional market made open to amateurs"" attracted by ""hype"" and ""unable to master the technical side"", he told AFP.

Christian, a 30 year-old marketing consultant, said it was like ""playing the lottery"" when he ""made all the mistakes"" on entering the crypto arena in 2021.

He recalled investing in about 30 cryptocurrencies ahead of their launch and ""without really knowing what it was all about"".

Only a minority of them actually saw the light of day and Christian said he ended up losing ""a five-figure sum"".

Molly White, founder of the ""Web3 is going just great"" blog where she documents wrongdoing in the crypto industry, said more awareness on crypto's volatility is needed.

""There are some companies that are selling cryptocurrencies with absolutely no disclosures to investors.""

White said that with crypto ""there's really no asset. There's no underlying product or service or feature there that is driving the price. It's really just the hype and the attention"".

Some analysts said crypto has gained popularity as the dollar weakens on expectations of cuts to US interest rates next year.

Bitcoin has won support also ahead of ""halving"" due in April, when the amount of tokens rewarded from mining drops by 50 percent.

The optimism surrounding the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) contributed to this surge.



The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency recorded a daily increase of 5.65 percent, peaking at USD41,688 around 05:30 GMT. This marks the highest level for Bitcoin since April 2022.



The overall value of the cryptocurrency market experienced a daily growth of 3.77 percent, reaching USD1.54 trillion, as reported by data from the digital asset price-tracking website, CoinMarketCap.



This positive trend was further supported by data indicating a slowdown in inflation in the United States, fostering expectations that the Federal Reserve had concluded interest rate hikes.

Recent data has revealed that Bitcoin has surpassed the world's largest banks regarding market capitalisation and is outperforming gold by 90%.

TURKEY - With the arrival of December, the picture regarding the performance of assets that lost or gained value in 2023 for many reasons, especially macroeconomic developments, began to become clear. Comparisons of digital assets that change rapidly and remain in the headlines throughout the year shed light on the annual performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the list published by Companiesmarketcap and containing the largest assets by market value, Bitcoin was ranked 12th. Bitcoin: It surpassed companies such as Eli Lilly, Visa and TSMC with its market

Gate Global Growth Director Kafkas Sönmez, who shared his evaluations on the subject, stated, ""As Bitcoin is a digital asset and investment tool, comparing it with a company solely in terms of market value should not directly influence investment preferences. Nevertheless, the market values of Bitcoin and Ethereum still provide clues about the economic impact of these two digital assets.'



In Companiesmarketcap's list comparing global banks with cryptocurrencies in terms of market value, it was seen that Bitcoin surpassed world-famous banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, ICBC, and Wells Fargo with a value of close to 760 billion dollars. Ethereum ranked third on the list, falling behind only JPMorgan.

Highlighting that the market value comparison shows Bitcoin is more valuable than all the banks in the world, Kafkas Sönmez remarked, ""When we consider non-banking global companies and assets, we see that Bitcoin is ahead of publicly traded companies like NVIDIA and Tesla. If Bitcoin were a company, it would be the 11th most valuable company in the world. However, there are also comments evaluating that this view is now outdated. According to recent analyses by Deutsche Bank, an increase in value was observed in Bitcoin due to the rising inflation as of 2021, which is parallel to the rise in valuations of technology companies. The analysis emphasises that technology stocks and digital assets experience a correction as interest rates begin to rise.""

Stating that the value losses or gains experienced by Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2023 are shallower compared to previous years, which indicates that large-scale fluctuations in the crypto markets have decreased, Gate Global Growth Director Kafkas Sönmez said,'In 2019, Bitcoin's average value is 90%. Its daily volatility was measured at 67%. In 2023, this figure dropped to 40%. This supports the resistance of the two crypto assets against inflation and gives legitimacy to the term 'digital gold', especially attributed to Bitcoin, so much so that Bitcoin appears to have outperformed gold by 93% and Ethereum by 39% since the beginning of the year. Considering the short history of Bitcoin, it can be said that the digital asset with the largest market value has left its volatility cycle behind in a very short time.""

Reminding that the last month of the year is a period for many investors to review their portfolios, reweigh assets and make new investment decisions, Kafkas Sönmez said,'With more than 1,700 cryptocurrencies listed on Gate and various tools and products that appeal to different investor profiles, We are expanding the opportunities for our users who want to make a fresh start in 2024. We regularly inform millions of users by following the performances of leading digital assets, especially Bitcoin, and new developments in the crypto ecosystem. All of these coincide with Gate Turkey's responsible investment approach, which encourages evaluating all variables and considering risks when making investment decisions.'

The cryptocurrency reached USD41,522 on Monday, its highest value since April 2022. This resurgence in Bitcoin's price signals a return to stability after recent tumult in the cryptocurrency markets, including the FTX platform collapse and other business challenges witnessed in 2022.



Justin Danithan, Head of Business Development for the Asia-Pacific region at KeyRock, a firm specializing in digital asset markets, emphasized the significance of the 50 percent surge since mid-October. This surge, according to Danithan, signifies a decisive departure from the bearish trend that prevailed throughout 2022 and the early part of 2023.



In a related development, Ethereum, the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain network, achieved its highest level in a year and a half, reaching a price of USD2,253. Despite these gains, both Bitcoin and Ethereum remain below their historical peaks in 2021, with Bitcoin exceeding USD60,000 and Ethereum reaching USD4,000.



The cryptocurrency markets continue to be under scrutiny, and the improved performance of Bitcoin prompts speculation about its potential resurgence as a viable option for traditional investments. As the cryptocurrency landscape undergoes shifts and challenges, investors are closely monitoring these developments to gauge the evolving dynamics of digital assets in the broader financial ecosystem.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_1.jpg,False,@menafn,7.693651,9b06a82cd6d1a1d761f2a0a14b3ff540

The,"(MENAFN- The Rio Times) El Salvador launched a new citizenship-by-investment program targeting individuals willing to invest $1 million in Bitcoin or USDT.



The country has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender for over two years. Now, it's broadening its economic scope.



Getting citizenship through this program costs more than in some Caribbean nations, where it starts at $100,000.



The Salvadoran government and Tether, a stablecoin issuer, jointly announced the program on December 7.



Named the ""Adopting El Salvador Freedom Visa Program,"" it aims to attrac investments. The program offers 1,000 citizenship spots for a $1 million investment in Bitcoin or USDT.







It starts with a $999 non-refundable deposit. El Salvador hopes to raise $1 billion if all opportunities are taken.



This approach is similar to successful schemes in countries like Vanuatu. Alistair Milne of Altana Digital Currency hedge fund criticized the program.



He mentioned on X (formerly Twitter) that EU citizenship costs less. Milne called El Salvador's offer less competitive globally.



He highlighted the ease of acquiring EU citizenship for a lower amount. Malta, for example, offers citizenship for 750,000 euros ($810,000).



This gives access to the EU's Schengen Area, which includes 23 countries. Henley & Partners, an investment migration consultancy, reported this.

El Salvador might attract cryptocurrency fans

Henley & Partners also noted Caribbean nations near El Salvador.



Countries like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia offer citizenship for a $100,000 development fund contribution.



Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis have similar programs, requiring contributions of $150,000 and $250,000.



Still, El Salvador might attract cryptocurrency fans.



President Nayib Bukele supports bitcoin. His policies include a 15-year tax break for tech firms investing in El Salvador.



Bukele has reduced the country's high homicide rates since June 2019.



His crime crackdown started in March 2022, leading to 66,000 arrests. Amnesty International raised human rights concerns about these arrests.



Nonetheless, a significant majority of Salvadorans, content with the recent improvements in peace and security, would readily vote for Bukele in future elections.



Bukele started his reelection campaign, leaving the presidential office on December 1. This was before the February 2024 general elections.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,7.6814313,356ca2a422e94a593c67dfd366ecf315

That's giving rise to new b,"(MENAFN- Asia Times) TOKYO – It's no coincidence that the price of gold has never been higher at a moment of maximum peril for the US dollar. That's giving rise to new bouts of PTSD for an Asia region that remembers all too well how sudden shifts in the global reserve currency can torpedo economic fates.

The fact that even Bitcoin is back in the game – topping US$43,000, up more than double this year – will hardly calm nerves in the halls of power from Beijing to Jakarta and trading pits from Tokyo to Mumbai.

Ostensibly, the dollar is sliding because the US Federal Reserve is believed to be done raising interest rates to tame inflation. The real problem, though, is a trifecta of concerns that are moving to center stage – and in the process setting Asia up for a rough 2024.

One, the cumulative fallout from the most aggressive US Fed tightening since the mid-1990s. Two, worries about America's train wreck of a fiscal trajectory. And three, political polarization in Washington that is putting the world's biggest economy's last AAA credit rating at risk.

Looked at one way, the dollar reaching its peak is something of a relief. As Alexandra Dimitrijevic, global head of research at S&P Global, notes, dollar strength'is compounding the pressures on many' emerging markets'given the $46 billion of rated dollar-denominated debt coming due next year, excluding China.'

Periods of extreme dollar strength don't tend to favor Asia's export-reliant economies. Powerful dollar rallies of the kind the globe saw these last few years have hoovered up disproportionate amounts of capital, depriving Asia of needed investment.

The Fed'taper tantrum' of 2013 is one reminder of this phenomenon. But the real bookend for Asia is the 1994-1995 period, the last time the Fed tightened as aggressively as it has over the last two years.

At the time, the Fed doubled short-term interest rates in just 12 months. By 1997, a multi-year dollar rally

and rising US yields made currency pegs impossible to maintain.

First came Thailand's chaos-generating devaluation in July 1997. Next, Indonesia and South Korea scrapped their dollar pegs. The turbulence pushed the Philippines and Malaysia to the brink, with the latter desperately imposing capital controls.

Before long, global investors began worrying Japan and China might also tumble. The fear then was that China might devalue the yuan, catalyzing a fresh wave of beggar thy neighbor market turbulence. Fortunately, Beijing didn't blink.

China isn't as keen on holding US debt as previously. Photo: Asia Times Files / Reuters / Jason Lee

Japan, meantime, caused serious global drama in November 1997 when Yamaichi Securities collapsed. The failure of a then-100-year-old Japan Inc icon shook markets everywhere. Japan, punters worried, wasn't too big to fail but too big to save. Thankfully, officials in Tokyo kept the collapse from becoming a systemic shock globally.

Now, Asia faces a giant shock from the other direction. Markets losing faith in the dollar is an even bigger systemic risk – and a more immediate one.

The dollar's stability was shaken anew in mid-November when Moody's Investors Service threatened to downgrade the US. That would mean the loss of Washington's last AAA rating, likely sending US 10-year bond yields skyrocketing.

It hardly helps, of course, that Moody's on Tuesday (December 5) cut its outlook for Chinese sovereign bonds to'negative' from'stable.' At the very least, it was a sign of deepening global concerns about mainland debt levels.

But the nagging threat of a US downgrade in many ways may eclipse any relief from the Fed throttling back on rate hikes.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/06/AT_9e377image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.650363,6837059882ec5fa923d42ee72a18e893

Bitcoin on Monday rose past $40,000 for the first time since May last year, boosted by hopes that the United States will soon allow broader trading of the world's biggest cryptocurrency.

The digital asset has skyrocketed this year, gaining nearly 150 percent, with expectations growing that US regulators will allow the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

These would track the price of bitcoin and allow the public to invest in the currency without directly purchasing it.

""This idea that institutional money in US capital markets is going to have a legitimate, compliant avenue... the expectations are extremely high that that's really going to take bitcoin to new levels,"" Lucy Guzmararian, founder of Token Bay Capital, told Bloomberg.

Bitcoin was trading above $40,700 at around 0400 GMT Monday.

The currency remains well below its record value of almost $69,000 in 2020, but the rally marks a recovery following the high-profile scandals and collapses that rocked the crypto industry.

FTX, the world's second-biggest crypto exchange, dramatically went under last year, and its boss Sam Bankman-Fried faces up to 110 years in prison for what prosecutors described as ""one of the biggest financial frauds in American history"".

And last month, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance -- the world's biggest crypto exchange -- after he and the company pleaded guilty to sweeping money laundering violations.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission is re-examining a bitcoin ETF application from asset manager Grayscale, as well as requests from other groups including BlackRock and ArkInvest.

Its first decision is expected to be on Ark Invest's application, by January 10 at the latest.

Bitcoin has also been boosted by hopes that the US Federal Reserve has wrapped up its hiking programme and may cut interest rates next year.

The asset's value has also been driven by the supply crunch expected next year because of an event called ""halving"".

Bitcoin is created -- or ""mined"" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems.

But the amount of bitcoin is limited and every four years, the reward is halved. The next ""halving"" is due in May 2024.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/04/AFP_3e209image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.359224,afbabdb32714bd280b17fb127d32eaa1

Schiff, who has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, suggests that the cryptocurrency's latest surge is a bubble waiting to burst . Following gold's dip below $2,100, Bitcoin witnessed a significant rise, touching approximately $41,000. Schiff sees this as a fleeting victory for Bitcoin, potentially its last hurrah before a dramatic decline.

A key point in Schiff's argument is the influence of the excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs on Bitcoin's recent rally. He warns that this speculative fervor is unsustainable, predicting a collapse more spectacular than any previous rally. Schiff contrasts this with gold's performance based on genuine value, making it a more stable and enduring investment.

Schiff's skepticism about Bitcoin stems from its perceived speculative nature. While acknowledging that gold and Bitcoin serve as stores of value, he questions Bitcoin's resilience in a real financial crisis . For Schiff, gold's ascent is underpinned by tangible value, not mere speculation.

Gold's recent trajectory saw it hitting a record peak of $2,100 in early December, only to lose a significant portion of its gains later. The rise in gold prices coincided with dovish statements from the US Federal Reserve. It lead to a decline in the dollar and Treasury yields . These developments propelled gold to new heights, fueling expectations of rate cuts by the US Central Bank shortly.

This unfolding scenario has implications for the cryptocurrency market. Optimists in crypto are hoping for new all-time highs across significant currencies. However, considering the volatile nature of these digital assets, such optimism might be premature.

While Schiff's predictions and skepticism about Bitcoin's future are notable, the cryptocurrency world remains unpredictable.

Investors and enthusiasts should approach gold and cryptocurrencies with a balanced perspective. They must acknowledge the potential risks and rewards in these diverse investment avenues.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-12/07/eS_8a20eimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,7.359224,49854895e24232369262e0853bbccd05

deVere Group's CEO Nigel Green is speaking out as the world's biggest cryptocurrency hit as high as $41,700 on Monday, its highest since April 2022.

Last month, Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, the founder of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, pleaded guilty to money laundering violations and agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down from his role as the company's chief executive.

The company itself also pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution to the government, according to federal authorities.

Nigel Green comments: ""The CZ/Binance scandal and the FTX collapse which resulted in a month-long trial which convicted the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, triggered some short-term volatility, but the crypto market has continued to remain bullish.

""In fact, Bitcoin is up by over 150% so far this year.

""It appears that law enforcement and regulatory authorities worldwide are cracking down on executives and companies of digital currencies. This greater regulatory scrutiny is seemingly appealing to investors who are piling into the likes of Bitcoin.

""It would also be attractive to institutional investors who bring with them huge amounts of capital.""

Microstrategy, the software developer and the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin boosted its holdings recently, buying some 16,130 BTC, worth around $610 million at current prices.

BlackRock, the $9trillion asset manager, alongside WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets, have published Bitcoin ETF applications waiting to be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC.

""We believe that Bitcoin ETFs are an imminent inevitability, and this would help drive crypto prices and mass adoption,"" says the deVere CEO.

""Should SEC approval happen, it would be a landmark moment for Bitcoin. The approval by the financial regulator of the world's largest economy of this spot ETF would show that Bitcoin is, without any question, part of the global mainstream financial system.""

Spot ETFs invest directly in underlying assets, typically stocks or bonds, at the current market price (spot price). They aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or asset class by holding a portfolio of the actual securities that make up the index.

""In addition, expectations the Federal Reserve and other major central banks are done hiking interest rates are fuelling Bitcoin prices,"" he adds.

Also in the mind of investors is next year's Bitcoin halving event. One of the key features of Bitcoin's monetary policy is its limited supply. The total number of Bitcoins that can ever exist is capped at 21 million coins.

Its issuance is also predictable. Through a process called mining, new Bitcoins are created and added to the circulating supply.

However, the rate of issuance is programmed to decrease over time. Initially, miners were rewarded with 50 Bitcoins for each block they successfully mined. This reward is halved approximately every four years in an event known as the 'halving.'

""The next halving is expected in April 2024. The lead-up has typically been the most profitable time for crypto investors.""

Nigel Green concludes: ""Scandal-triggered crackdowns, expected central bank plans, and next year's halving event are fueling Bitcoin prices. We expect this trend to continue for the rest of this year and into 2024.""

The cryptocurre","(MENAFN- The Rio Times) On Wednesday, Bitcoin approached the significant $44,000 mark, marking its longest streak of continuous gains since May.



The cryptocurrency's surge is partly due to anticipated changes in U.S. monetary policy. The market leader in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin , increased for six days until Tuesday.



It gained about 16% during this period, reaching a high of $44,491. However, it later saw a slight decrease.



Since 2023, following last year's downturn in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin's recovery has been remarkable, achieving a 163% increase.



From mid-September, Bitcoin's value has risen almost 80%. This impressive growth quickly pushed it past the $30,000 and $40,000 thresholds.



Speculation also played a role in Bitcoin's rise. Market participants believe the U.S. might soon approve its first Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).



In June, BlackRock applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch such a product.



This move indicates a potential wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.







Market analyst Tony Sycamore from IG Australi noted that the ETF news has likely been factored into Bitcoin's price.



He emphasized cryptocurrencies' heightened sensitivity to changes in Federal Reserve policies compared to other asset classes.



Bitcoin's current trend is overshadowing worries that its value increase might be excessive.



Other smaller digital currencies, such as Avalanche (AVAX) and Dogecoin (DOGE), are also experiencing growth.



In South Korea, the optimistic trend was evident. Bitcoin traded about 4% higher than the global price on Upbit and Bithumb exchanges on Wednesday.



This ""kimchi premium"" phenomenon resurfaced, reminiscent of the crypto boom during the pandemic.



In Abu Dhabi, Phoenix Group Plc, a crypto mining hardware dealer, experienced a 35% increase in its stock value at its debut.



This marks the first crypto-related listing in the Middle East.

El Salvador has profited from Bitcoin investment

President Nayib Bukele stated in El Salvador that the country has profited from its Bitcoin investments. He announced this during his campaign for reelection after resigning last week.



Another positive influence on Bitcoin is next year's upcoming ""halving"" event. This event, which happens every four years, will cut the token rewards for miners in half.



It aims to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million tokens. Bitcoin has historically reached new highs after each halving.



Zach Pandl from Grayscale Investments remarked that both micro and macro factors are aligning in Bitcoin's favor.



As of 9:30 AM Brasília time, Bitcoin's trading price stood at $44,007.03. It previously hit a peak of about $69,000 in November 2021.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,7.050312,521a9fef93f98bba8c1697e7d841caf7

Bitcoin, the frontrunner in the cryptocurrency realm, notably surged beyond the USD40,000 threshold for the first time this year, propelled by optimistic expectations of a forthcoming reduction in interest rates in the United States.



Marking a noteworthy milestone, Bitcoin achieved a record high of USD41,522 yesterday, marking its pinnacle since April 2022. This surge suggests a potential departure from the recent tumultuous trends that have characterized cryptocurrency markets. The positive momentum has sparked renewed interest and optimism among investors.



Simultaneously, Ethereum, the digital currency tethered to the Ethereum blockchain network, experienced its highest valuation in a year and a half, reaching an impressive USD2,253. Despite this commendable surge, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are still trailing behind their peak values in 2021. Bitcoin, at that time, surpassed the USD60,000 mark, while Ethereum reached an all-time high of USD4,000.



The current market scenario witnessed Bitcoin's value escalating by 2.16 percent during today's trading, reaching an impressive USD41,761. The corresponding surge in market capitalization elevated the currency's overall value to a substantial USD817 billion. While the current prices are a positive indication for the digital currency market, observers note the considerable gap that persists between the current values and the record highs established in 2021. Nevertheless, the recent surge underscores a potential shift towards more favorable conditions, offering a positive outlook for digital currency enthusiasts and investors alike.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_2.jpg,False,@menafn,7.050312,01deb1054b81859f9a39d9d2e121db3e

The world's biggest cryptocurrency hit as high as $41,748 on Monday, its highest since April 2022, seemingly casting off the funk that had settled over crypto markets following the collapse of FTX and other crypto-business failures last year.

It was last up 4% at $41,627. Its 50% rally since mid-October has'seemed to mark a decisive shift away from the bearishness of 2022 and early 2023,' said Justin d'Anethan – head of business development for Asia-Pacific at Keyrock, a digital assets market making firm.

D'Anethen said evidence of institutional buying through November showed a new leg of interest and that although reversals ahead were not inconceivable, lows hit around $16,000 a year ago'probably marked the bottom'.

Bitcoin is up by over 150% so far this year.

Bitcoin-investor Microstrategy (MSTR.O) last week disclosed it bought an additional $593 million in bitcoin during November.

Meanwhile, riskier investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets, such as gold, have also rallied hard over the last few weeks as markets wager that the U.S. Federal Reserve has finished hiking rates and will start cutting early in 2024.

Reports in October that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won't appeal a court ruling that found the agency had been wrong to reject an exchange-traded fund application have also driven bets that an eventual approval is near.

A spot bitcoin ETF could allow previously wary investors access to crypto via the stock market, ushering a new wave of capital into the sector.

Investors have also welcomed the settlement of a years-long U.S. criminal probe into Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange and a key cog in the worldwide crypto market. The deal, which saw Binance founder Changpeng Zhao step down after pleading guilty to breaking U.S. anti-money laundering laws, allows the company to continue operating.

Ether , the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, also rose to a 1-1/2 year high on Monday, hitting $2,264.

Both bitcoin and ether remain far below their record highs, hit in 2021, of $69,000 and $4,868 respectively.

The cryptocurrency experienced a notable uptrend over a six-day period, registering a gain of approximately 16 percent until Tuesday, and continued to strengthen in early Asian trading. Its overall ascent since the commencement of 2023 stands at about 165 percent, showcasing a remarkable recovery from the lows witnessed during the cryptocurrency crisis last year. However, Bitcoin's value saw a marginal dip during trading, reaching USD43,851.



While this current price level remains substantially lower than its 2021 record of about USD69,000, optimism is fueled by the anticipation that the United States might greenlight the launch of the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) directly investing in Bitcoin. The potential approval of such ETFs could broaden the investor base, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments among the companies seeking licenses to launch cryptocurrency funds. Analysts are optimistic that these funds could receive approval as early as January.



Bitcoin's recent uptick has not only been influenced by ETF expectations but has also allayed concerns about an overly extended rally beyond anticipated limits. Concurrently, the positive momentum in Bitcoin has spilled over to smaller cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and Dogecoin, which have also experienced price increases.

Ethereum (ETH) jumped more than 5 per cent and hit $2,382 on Friday, its highest level since May 2022.

Solana (SOL) jumped over 8 per cent to $69, also the highest since May 2022, reports CoinDesk.

Bitcoin was hovering around $43,500 on Friday, after climbing to near $45,000 earlier this week. Ether classic (ETC) increased 6 per cent, while liquid staking protocol Lido's governance token (LDO) increased by over 11 per cent.

According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, traders are fearful that crypto markets may be in a bull trap at the moment.'While Bitcoin may have stopped its momentum for the time being, Ethereum and altcoins are blasting off once again,' it posted.

The surge in Bitcoin prices has pushed the crypto market capitalisation over $1.5 trillion for the first time since May 2022, when Terra crypto token collapse kicked-off the crypto winter. The macroeconomic environment is also supporting Bitcoin's price rise.

""Dovish talk from some Fed officials, a weakening dollar, and relatively sturdy domestic data helped propel markets over the weekend,"" Alex Thorn, head of research at digital asset investment firm Galaxy, was quoted as saying.

Bitcoin is up more than 150 per cent year-to-date, and it is one of the world's best-performing assets on a risk-adjusted basis. ""Despite the run, Bitcoin remains very constructive,"" said analysts.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates Dec 9, 2023 (Issuewire )

-

Mining Grid , The Blockchain technology-based startup, is thrilled to announce the official launch of its groundbreaking initiative, 'Mining Race '. This innovative program is set to make waves in the mining community on a global scale.

In recent days, Bitcoin's hash rate, the measure of computing power needed for transaction verification and cryptocurrency generation through mining, reached unprecedented levels of over 550 EH/s. This remarkable growth in hash rate highlights the increasing strength and activity within the Bitcoin network.

Ahead of the BTC Halving early next year, miners are looking to lock in more profits. Coupled with the fact that the value of Bitcoin has risen over 149% since the beginning of the year, presents a great opportunity for miners. As the demand for BTC mining continues to skyrocket, the Mining Grid positions itself as a pioneer in this thriving industry.

Headquartered in the UAE, Mining Grid is led by a visionary board consisting of H.H. Sheikh Saeed bin Hasher Al-Maktoum, Solaiman Al-Rifai, and Rami Alsridi. Their expertise and passion for innovation drive the company toward new heights in the crypto world.

Mining Race is experiencing rapid growth, with an impressive community of over 1500 subscribers from 35 countries during its soft launch. However, it has a goal of reaching a diverse community of 1 million subscribers from all over the world by 2025. In the world of Mining Race, subscribers are referred to as 'Racers' and are allocated a position on the network called a 'Spot'. The Mining Race application is available for both iOS and Android platforms, providing a seamless experience for Racers. It includes a non-custodial wallet, ensuring the highest level of security. The app offers convenient access for Racers to set up an account, reserve their Spot, and effortlessly connect it with their Bitcoin miners, apart from monitoring and withdrawing their earnings. Mining Race also provides a dashboard, that presents real-time updates for Racers. Additionally, it has a Racers Club where Racers can keep track of their standings in various Races.

Rami Alsridi, the Founder and Managing Director of Mining Grid said,'We provide enhanced accessibility for individuals keen on Bitcoin mining. Mining Race allows subscribers to access mining services such as buying a Bitcoin miner with hosting services, monitoring its performance, and receiving mining rewards. Our platform is designed to cater to both, experienced miners and those who are new to crypto.""

Mining Race revolutionizes Bitcoin mining by integrating racing into the community ecosystem. The Racers mine Bitcoin for rewards and contribute to the community. Rewards are distributed among connected Spots, promoting teamwork and growth. Mining Race complements traditional mining, ensuring fairness with smart contracts. Racers also enjoy community activities like Races, incentive campaigns, and various other bonuses. Compared to solo mining, Mining Race encourages collaboration and maximizes rewards. Empowering its community, Mining Race leads the charge in global Bitcoin mining expansion.

Solaiman Al-Rifai, Founder and Board Member of Mining Grid added, ""Mining Race addresses the evolving needs of the diverse Blockchain community. As the world embraces the future of technology, Mining Grid leads the charge with a commitment to innovation, sustainability, and a greener tomorrow.""

Throughout this journey, Mining Grid remains committed to robust environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. In line with its commitment, Mining Grid has initiated the 'Race to Zero Carbon' campaign. Traditional Bitcoin mining relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources, which poses significant environmental challenges. By contributing a portion of their earnings towards this initiative, all Racers demonstrate their dedication to supporting projects aligned with Mining Grid's vision for a sustainable future and environmental protection.

Future Plans:

Mining Grid's future plans include network expansion, technological advancements, and global adoption. They aim to attract more individuals and organizations to the Mining Race platform, creating a robust mining network. Continuous investment in cutting-edge technologies and software development will enhance the user experience and support projects within the broader crypto community. Additionally, Mining Grid is actively working to increase global adoption by providing easy access to Bitcoin mining services and creating a user-friendly platform, making cryptocurrency mining accessible worldwide.

About Mining Grid:

Mining Grid is a leading provider of sustainable Blockchain solutions, committed to revolutionizing the global mining industry. With a focus on eco-friendly transparent practices and cutting-edge technology, Mining Grid empowers users worldwide to participate in the future of Blockchain with confidence and responsibility.

The Bitcoin system runs on a dynamic P2P network, containing tens of thousands of nodes, including reachable nodes and unreachable nodes. In this article, a detection system, BNS (Bitcoin Network Sniffer), which could collect as many Bitcoin nodes as possible is proposed. For reachable nodes, the authors designed an algorithm, BRF (Bitcoin Reachable-Nodes Finding), based on node activity evaluation which reduces the nodes to be detected and greatly shortens the detection time. For unreachable nodes, the authors trained a decision tree model, BUF (Bitcoin Unreachable-Nodes Finding), to identify unreachable nodes based on attribute features from a large number of node addresses. Experiments showed that BNS discovered an average of 1093 more reachable nodes (6.4%) and 662 more unreachable nodes (2.3%) than the well-known website 'Bitnodes' per day.

This is undoubtedly a huge expense, 
but behind the story of ORDI's thousand-fold increase in wealth, more BRC20 inscriptions have been dragged into the quagmire of 'sky-high gas consumption
'. This wave of inscriptions and the corresponding pricey fees is evolving into a funfair for miners and burden for users.
 
UXUY officially announced its support for Lightning Network and Lightning addresses on December 5, 2023, becoming the world's first DEX to support Lightning Network. In the same vein, the Layer 2 plan initiated by UXUY — 'Struck by Lightning' began.
 
The goal at UXUY is to go all out to help users rescue themselves from paying sky-high gas fees through the Lightning Network, and to truly achieve a transaction experience with zero gas fees, and millisecond transfer, using Bitcoin's native consensus.
 
Users can activate the lightning address DID service (such as hello@uxuy.com) by using the latest version of UXUY APP, and can 
receive up to 5,000,000 Bitcoin Sats airdrops
. Currently, nearly 10,000 users from more than 40 countries and regions have participated in the event and successfully received the airdrop reward.
 
Reintroducing the Lightning Network
 
As Bitcoin Layer 2, the Lightning Network has successfully solved the problems of long block confirmation on the Bitcoin main network and expensive gas costs. Relying on the security of the Bitcoin main network, it has become Layer 2 with the most potential . Currently, The Lightning Network has a total of 5,080 BTC stored, and more than 1.16 million unique users use it for transactions and payments every month, and this amount continues to grow.
 
On October 18, 2023, Lightning Labs officially released Taproot Assets, which launched the Bitcoin Lightning Network into the multi-asset era. Since then, it has become possible to issue digital assets and stablecoins on the Lightning Network.
 
Kevin, the founder of UXUY, once published an article on his blog entitled ""
Stablecoins are the biggest variable in the Bitcoin ecosystem
"", in which he mentioned:
 
 
There is currently $126B in stablecoin market size, and it does not run on Bitcoin at all. Five years later, let us look back at this data, and we will get a brand new answer. This is the biggest variable in the Bitcoin ecosystem in the next five years. This is a challenge for UXUY, but also an opportunity for UXUY.
 
 
The introduction of the Lightning Network into stablecoins will not only increase the scale of payment scenarios, but also improve the convenience of transactions with native Taproot Assets in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Traders can not only trade diversified assets, but also enjoy the ultimate experience of zero gas fees.
 
Soon, we can see: 
encrypted assets on the Lightning Network, stablecoins on the Lightning Network, and Bitcoin on the Lightning Network
... The Lightning Network breeds unlimited possibilities for Web3. With this conviction in mind, UXUY launches this round of airdrops to provide users with free Lightning address DID services, which will become the passport of the new era of Web3, allowing users to have smooth access to the Lightning Network ecosystem.
 
 
Users from all over the world share the joy of receiving Bitcoin on the X platform
All In on the Bitcoin Track
As a DEX, UXUY is fully betting on the Bitcoin track.

What's behind the price surge?",Associated Press,2023-12-04 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/12/04/bitcoin-has-surpassed-41000-for-the-first-time-since-april-2022-whats-behind-the-price-surge,ny1.com,Bitcoin is once again having a moment,"NEW YORK (AP) — 
Bitcoin
 is once again having a moment. On Monday, the world's largest cryptocurrency soared past $41,000 for the first time in over a year and a half — and marking a 150% rise so far this year.
 
Volatile bitcoin rocketed from just over $5,000 at the start of the pandemic to nearly $68,000 in November 2021, according to FactSet, a period marked by a 
surge in demand
 for technology products. Prices fell back to earth during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at taming inflation and 
then the collapse
 of FTX, one of the biggest companies in crypto.
 
When 2023 began, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000 after losing more than 75% of its value. Investors, however, began 
returning in large numbers
 as inflation started to cool. And the 
collapse of prominent tech-focused banks
 actually led more investors to turn to crypto as they bailed out of positions in Silicon Valley start-ups and other risky bets. 
 
But 
fueling this latest rally
 are prospects for the possible approval of spot bitcoin 
exchange traded funds
 — a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks. 
 
Industry advocates say this new way of investing in bitcoin at spot prices, instead of futures, could make it easier for anyone to enter the cryptoverse while lowering some of the 
well-documented risks
 associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. Regulators have previously rejected bitcoin spot ETF applications, but recent wins for some crypto fund managers have improved odds for a first approval, perhaps as soon as next month.
 
'The longer-term catalyst (for bitcoin) is a lot of optimism related to the potential approval of a spot ETF,' Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey said Monday. He noted, however, that a regulatory green light doesn't promise continued gains.
 
While analysts expect the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs to create a much larger pool of crypto investors, future volumes could go either way, Carey added. That could either boost or undermine bitcoin's value.
 
Bitcoin's current rally also arrives during an incredibly disruptive period for cryptocurrencies. Just last month, the U.S. government slapped Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, with 
a $4 billion fine
 as its founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a felony charge. 
 
But Binance continues to operate and maintain its market share, Carey noted. In some ways, the company's settlement 'propelled the market forward more by removing one of the ... more ominous overhangs that was a sort of a big question mark,' he said, noting bitcoin's gains in the two weeks since the settlement was announced.
 
Despite the recent excitement around bitcoin, experts still maintain that crypto is a risky bet with wildly unpredictable fluctuations in value. In short, investors can lose money as quickly as they make it.
 
Last year's 
collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX
 also 'left a big scar' on the public's confidence in the crypto industry and crushed retail investors, Edward Moya, a former senior market analyst at Oanda, 
previously told The Associated Press
 — noting that institutional money, like hedge funds, are behind the bulk of current crypto investing.
 
Carey added that liquidity in cryptocurrency markets has yet to return to where it was before FTX collapsed, and lower liquidity can exacerbate price fluctuations.
 
'In the past few months, that has normally been the price moving up — but people should always be aware it can go in the reverse and quickly,' he said.
 
As of around 1:30 p.m. Eastern time Monday, the price of bitcoin stood at $41,709.
 
The stocks of some other crypto players have also seen rises over recent months, but not with the same speed or heights as bitcoin. Ethereum, for example, stood at $2,223 Monday afternoon, up 85% since the start of 2023. Meanwhile, Binance Coin and Dash are down about 5.25% and 24.37% for the year, respectively, with Monday afternoon prices of roughly $231 and $32.

Bitcoin price retreated in the overnight session as the recent bullish momentum faded. The BTC/USD pair dropped to a low of 40,120, its lowest point since December 4th. It has crashed by more than 8% from its highest point this week Reserve decision ahead

Bitcoin has been in a strong bullish trend this year as it jumped from less than $20,000 to over $40,000 today. It has risen because of three key reasons, including hopes of interest rate cuts by the Fed, upcoming Bitcoin halving, and the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF.

Now, there are signs that the Fed will not cut interest rates as early as expected. On Friday, the US published strong jobs numbers, which showed that the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7% in November. The economy added over 190k jobs in November.

The US published relatively strong consumer inflation data. According to the BLS, the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose from 0.0% in October to 0.1% in November. It dropped from 3.2% to 3.1% on a YoY basis.

On the other hand, core inflation rose slightly from 0.2% to 0.3%. It remained unchanged at 4.0%, double the Fed's target of 2.0%. Therefore, these numbers mean that the country's inflation is not falling as fast as expected.

The next important Bitcoin catalyst will be the upcoming Federal Reserve decision. After the latest jobs and inflation numbers, economists believe that the bank will decide to leave rates unchanged.

Jerome Powell, the bank's chair, is expected to push back against the rising hopes of interest rate cuts in the near term. Some economists have been pricing in a 0.25% rate cut in the March meeting., which explains why the coin jumped/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has retreated sharply in the past few days. It has moved from the year-to-date high of $44,910 to about $40,000. The BTC/USD pair has also dropped below the 50-period moving average . The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have all pointed downwards.

Bitcoin has dropped below the first support of the Woodie Pivot point . Therefore, the outlook for the pair is bearish, with the next point to watch being at 38,125, the second Woodie pivot. The stop-loss of this trade is at 43,000.

Bitcoin continued to supercharge on Tuesday morning as demand for the coin continued. The BTC/USD pair surged to a high of 42,100, its highest point since April 2022. It has soared by more than 172% from its lowest point since November last year Reserve and SEC

Bitcoin has been in a strong uptrend, helped by the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Most economists believe that the Fed will start easing its tight monetary policy in the coming months.

Recent data showed that American inflation has dropped slightly in the past few months. It has moved from the 2022 high of 9.1% to 3.2%. There are signs that inflation continued falling as the price of energy moved downwards.

In Europe, the headline inflation figure has dropped to 2.4% and is quickly approaching the European Central Bank (ECB) target of 2.0%. Therefore, like the Fed, most economists expect the ECB will also slash rates in the first half of 2024.

Bitcoin and other risky assets tend to do well when interest rates are falling. This explains why the coin has surged this year.

The other big catalyst is the recent spot ETF applications by large companies like Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco. Most analysts believe that the SEC will ultimately bow to pressure and approve the ETFs.

An approval will be positive for BTC because of how rare it has become. Bitcoin supply in exchanges has dropped to the lowest level in years. Over 19.5 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 1.5 million of them to be mined.

The other big Bitcoin catalyst is the upcoming halving, which will happen in late April of 2024. Historically, Bitcoin tends to do well ahead of a Bitcoin halving/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. It has moved above the key resistance levels at 40,000 and 41,000. On the daily chart, the pair remains above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It formed a golden cross when the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossover.

The Average Directional Index (ADX) has retreated but it remains above 40. Therefore, the outlook for the BTC/USD pair is bullish, with the next level to watch will be at 45,000.

The BTC/USD pair retreated sharply as Bitcoin price lost its momentum and as traders started to take profits. Bitcoin retreated to a low of $40,000, its lowest level since December 4th. It has dropped by about 10% from the highest level this year on Federal Reserve data

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few days as focus shifted to the latest US jobs data and the upcoming Federal Reserve decision. The sell-off started after the US published strong jobs numbers on Friday.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the economy created over 199k jobs in November while the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7%. Wages grew by 4% on a YoY basis.

Therefore, Bitcoin retreated as investors anticipated a more hawkish Federal Reserve when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday.

The Fed's statement will likely depend on Tuesday's consumer inflation data. Economists polled by Reuters expect the numbers to show that the headline CPI dropped from 3.2% in October to 3.1% in November. A stronger figure than expected will likely lead to a more hawkish tone by the Fed on Wednesday.

The BTC/USD pair also retreated as investors started to take profits since it has been in a strong bull run. It has risen by more than 30% in the past few weeks. In most cases, Bitcoin tends to retreat after having a strong rally.

Bitcoin's rally has been driven by several factors recently. There have been hopes that the Fed will start to cut interest rates in the first half of the year. It has also rallied as hopes that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a Bitcoin ETF/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin has pulled back in the past few days. It formed a double-top pattern at 44,790 whose neckline was at 42,856. In most cases, this pattern is one of the most bearish signs. Bitcoin has also crashed below the 50-period and 25-period moving averages.

Bitcoin has also dropped below the first support of the Woodie pivot point. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillators have moved to the oversold level.

Therefore, the outlook for the pair is bearish, with the next point to watch being at the second support at 38,126. In the near term, however, Bitcoin will likely bounce back and retest the highest point this year.

Bitcoin price continued its strong recovery as the recent surge accelerated. The BTC/USD price has risen in the past eight straight weeks and is now trading at its highest point since April 2022. It has become the best-performing asset as it jumped by over 183% from its lowest point this year and greed index rises

Bitcoin continued its strong rally as the hype in the crypto industry continued. The fear and greed index rose to the greed zone of 79, signaling that investors are getting greedy in the market. In most cases, BTC tends to do well when there is a greed sentiment.

Bitcoin has risen for several reasons. First, there is growing hopes that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the coming weeks or months. Several large companies, including Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco have filed for ETFs.

These companies are notable because of their history and performance in the financial market. Blackrock is the biggest asset management in the world with over $9 trillion in assets. Franklin Templeton and Invesco also have over $1.5 trillion and $1.52 trillion in assets, respectively.

They also have a long track record of running ETFs. For example, Blackrock runs hundreds of ETFs, including the iShares Core S&P 500 fund that has over $380 billion in assets. Therefore, an approval will likely lead to more Bitcoin demand in the coming months.

Bitcoin has also rallied because of the rising hope that the Federal Reserve is done hiking interest rates. The bank has hiked rates from zero in 2022 to a two-decade high of 5.50%. Now, with inflation falling, there is a likelihood that the bank will cut rates in the next few months. Inflation has dropped in most countries, including in the euro area and Switzerland/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. It has jumped in the past five straight days and moved above all moving averages. The pair's Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have moved to the overbought levels. Also, the Average Directional Index (ADX) remains above 40.

Therefore, the outlook for the pair will continue as buyers target the key resistance level at 46,000. If this happens, the BTC/USD price will hit the key resistance point at 50,000.

As it stands, all indications point to an upward trajectory, with the possibility of the cryptocurrency targeting the $45,000 level in the near term. The prevailing sentiment appears decidedly bullish, and any pullbacks in the market are being closely monitored for potential buying opportunities, with the prospect of finding value.

In this dynamic market, there is a substantial support level at $40,000, often referred to as a ""floor in the market."" Additionally, the 20-Day Exponential Moving Averag is aligning itself with this level, reinforcing its significance. However, it's essential to acknowledge that Bitcoin's hallmark is its volatility, a characteristic inherent not only to Bitcoin but the broader crypto sphere.



Furthermore, investors are closely monitoring the possibility of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) making its debut in the coming months.

This development has sparked excitement within the crypto community, despite the irony that an ETF represents a departure from the original ethos of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, it underscores the growing interest in bridging traditional financial networks with the emerging landscape of digital currencies.

One notable factor influencing Bitcoin's trajectory is the relationship between interest rates in the United States and the cryptocurrency. Interest rates have demonstrated a negative correlation with Bitcoin, as lower interest rates tend to incentivize investors to seek higher returns further along the risk spectrum. Conversely, higher interest rates could deter institutional investors from venturing into the cryptocurrency market ETF?

While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to indicate an overbought condition, it's important to note that this alone does not necessitate a breakdown in Bitcoin's price. Instead, it may signify a period of consolidation as the market recalibrates and absorbs recent gains.

In the end, the outlook for Bitcoin appears buoyant, with the cryptocurrency poised for potential gains in the short term. The market's inherent volatility remains a defining characteristic, but investors are vigilant in identifying opportunities within the fluctuations. Bitcoin's performance remains closely intertwined with interest rate dynamics in the United States and the evolving landscape of financial instruments, such as the anticipated Bitcoin ETF, which continues to capture the imagination of market participants. The cryptocurrency market remains an arena of considerable intrigue, offering both challenges and opportunities for those navigating its complexities.

BTC/USD traders experienced a choppy ride in the cryptocurrency market this week, with a significant dip on Monday followed by a modest recovery on Tuesday. The digital coin has been oscillating around the $40,000 mark, a level that holds both psychological significance and technical support from the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average .

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

Investors and traders are keeping a close eye on this $40,000 threshold, as its breach could signify a strong resurgence in Bitcoin's value. If Bitcoin manages to break through the recent trading range, it could mark the beginning of its next upward trajectory. In this scenario, we could see a move to the $47500 level.

In the current scenario, market participants can expect continued volatility. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently dipped below the overbought territory, catching the attention of technical traders. The RSI's movements often influence short-term trading decisions, and its current position suggests potential buying opportunities for those watching closely Bank Influence

The crypto market's fate in the coming days will be shaped by central banks and their monetary policies, which can have a significant impact on bond markets. A crucial indicator for Bitcoin's future performance is the movement of bond yields. If yields start to decline, it typically bodes well for Bitcoin, as it signals a favorable environment for cryptocurrency. Under these conditions, Bitcoin could make a strong push towards the $45,000 level and possibly reach as high as $47,500 over the longer term.

The $40,000 level remains a critical support level for Bitcoin, and its ability to stay above this mark is of utmost importance to many investors. A break below this level could lead to further downward pressure, potentially taking Bitcoin down to the $35,000 level.

Additionally, as we approach the holiday season, market liquidity may come into play. Historically, trading volumes tend to thin out during this time of year as many traders take time off for the holidays. This reduced liquidity can lead to more pronounced price swings and unexpected movements in the market.

In the end, Bitcoin's recent ups and downs highlight the market's inherent volatility. While the $40,000 level and the 20-Day EMA provide some support, market participants should remain cautious and monitor key technical indicators like the RSI. The interplay between central bank policies, bond yields, and holiday season will have a major impact on BTC in the short term.

Ethereum experienced a significant surge in its value during the early hours of Monday, spurred by the anticipation of the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates by the end of March.

This upward trend in Ethereum's market is largely attributed to traders' reactions to the fluctuating interest rates, with current market conditions indicating a halt in the Federal Reserve's rate hikes. This perceived pause in rate increases has led to an influx of ""hot money"" into cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

The prospect of lower ""risk-free rates"" has made Ethereum an attractive option for traders seeking higher returns. Despite the appealing yields offered by bonds, there's a notable downward trend in bond yields, prompting investors to redirect their focus towards cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, in particular, is drawing attention due to its perceived stability and growth potential. The $2100 mark, previously a point of resistance, is now seen as a key support level. This shift in market dynamics, coupled with a sense of ""market memory,"" suggests that Ethereum is a valuable buy at current levels. Investors willing to take a calculated risk of around $250 per coin are likely to lean towards a bullish stance on Ethereum, given the current market trends.No Real Ethereum Sellers Out There

The reluctance to short Ethereum stems from the strong presence of buyers in the market and the anticipation of a continuous upward trend. A significant breach of trust would be indicated if Ethereum falls below the $1900 support level, potentially leading to a change in the overall market trend. However, as it stands, the dominance of buyers in the market makes any dip in Ethereum's value a potentially lucrative buying opportunity. Analysts believe that Ethereum has the potential to reach and surpass the $2500 threshold in the foreseeable future, highlighting its strong position in the cryptocurrency market.

This analysis reflects the current sentiment and trends in the cryptocurrency market, specifically focusing on Ethereum. The interplay between interest rates, market dynamics, and investor sentiment is crucial in understanding Ethereum's recent performance and its potential trajectory. The market's sensitivity to interest rate changes and the shifting balance between risk and return are key factors influencing Ethereum's value and appeal to investors.

On Thursday's trading session, Bitcoin experienced a minor retreat, indicating an ongoing quest for value in the market.

Undoubtedly, the market has displayed bullish sentiment over the past few weeks, but it appears that it may have surged ahead of itself at this juncture. My interest in buying would be significantly piqued if we were to witness a pullback towards the $40,000 threshold. Presently, it seems that the market lacks the requisite level of value to justify substantial capital investment. The allure of the $40,000 level lies in its appeal to traders, as it represents a significant, round, and psychologically impactful figure.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

Conversely, surpassing the $44,000 level once more may negate the prospects of the sought-after pullback. Ultimately, the market is likely to explore the $47,500 level. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that Bitcoin's trajectory could be influenced by developments in the bond markets. Therefore, it is prudent to closely monitor the performance of the 10-year yield in the United States, especially with the upcoming release of employment data on Friday, which could lead to fluctuations in yields.I Am Not Shorting

That said, I currently hold no desire to short Bitcoin as it continues to exhibit a pronounced bullish bias. Worth noting is that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in overbought territory, but it appears to be gradually retracing towards the 70 level. Should the RSI break below 70, it could potentially attract buyers back into the market. It is not so much a matter of fundamental changes in Bitcoin's nature at this moment, but rather a need to address the overbought condition, either through consolidation or, preferably, a pullback that would encourage more investors to enter the market.

In any case, I maintain the belief that over time, we will see Bitcoin gravitate towards the $47,500 level. Consequently, my strategy is to patiently await an opportune moment to re-enter the market. That being said, I think that the next week or two could see a drying up of liquidity, but a lot of people are getting excited about the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF coming early next year. Whether or not that happens remains to be seen, but at this point, there is belief that it is coming. Ultimately, I think this is a situation where traders will continue to look at any pullback as an opportunity.

During the early part of Tuesday's trading session, Bitcoin exhibited a slight pullback but soon attracted buyers, indicating resilience and potential for further growth.

This market, known for its volatility, requires traders to be cautious with their position sizing. Despite the inherent noise and fluctuations, there is an overarching sentiment that Bitcoin is poised for an upward trajectory, particularly in light of expectations around the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

A key level to watch is the $40,000 mark, which holds significant psychological importance and is viewed as a major support zone. This level is likely to attract attention from value hunters, reinforcing Bitcoin's momentum-driven nature. With its current momentum, the market seems to have a solid foundation for continued growth.

Another important technical indicator is the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which has repeatedly served as a support level for Bitcoin. Traders should keep a close eye on this indicator for signs of potential market movements. Looking upwards, the $42,500 level emerges as a short-term target, though the market currently appears somewhat overstretched, suggesting a need for value-driven trading strategies, But Still Bullish

Despite the market seeming a bit extended at present, the longer-term outlook for Bitcoin remains positive. The potential for reaching as high as $47,000 on long-term charts exists, but the journey is unlikely to be a direct ascent. Therefore, traders should remain vigilant and judicious in their position sizing, recognizing that while the market trend is predominantly bullish, the path is fraught with volatility and requires careful selection of entry points.

In essence, while Bitcoin's current market condition indicates a bullish trend, it is not without its challenges. The market is characterized by noise and fluctuations, necessitating a strategic and cautious approach to trading. Paying attention to key technical levels and market indicators will be crucial for traders to navigate this dynamic environment effectively. As the market evolves, staying informed and adaptable will be key to capitalizing on the BTC market, which of course will be influenced by external factors more than anything else. I think this remains a'buy on the dips' market, but there is a lot of volatility in financial assets at the moment regardless, and as such – you need to be very careful. This market is one I am not looking to sell anytime soon, as the buyers have been so aggressive.

Bitcoin saw a substantial drop in value during Monday's trading session, sliding down to the critical $40,000 mark.

The $40,000 level carries significant psychological weight, being a substantial, round, and psychosocially noteworthy figure that has garnered widespread attention. Adding to the intrigue, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped back below the overbought condition threshold of 70, hinting at the possibility of sustained upward pressure. Notably, just below the $40,000 level, we find the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average .

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

Considering all factors, this appears to be a juncture where many buyers may seize the opportunity and begin purchasing, potentially setting the stage for a rally toward the $45,000 level. The $45,000 level is expected to be closely monitored, and if we manage to surpass it, the $47,500 level emerges as the next point of interest. This level is rooted in the previous market reaction on the weekly timeframe and, if breached, could pave the way for a significant bullish run. Nevertheless, it's essential to keep in mind that the holiday season might divert focus away from trading activities, potentially leading to liquidity issues, particularly for institutional participants Coming?

There is substantial excitement surrounding the prospect of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) potentially launching early next year. Nevertheless, some argue that this development primarily represents Wall Street's desire to extract fees from cryptocurrency trades. Consequently, there is a plausible scenario where the market undergoes a ""sell the news"" scenario once the ETF becomes a reality. Furthermore, it's prudent to closely monitor the last few days of December, given the recurring trend of ""end of the month markup"" in the crypto market. This phenomenon, with its roots in the stock market, involves institutional traders pushing prices higher toward the end of the month to report greater profits to their investors.

Taking all these factors into consideration, it's reasonable to anticipate the presence of buyers in the market from now until the end of the year. However, it's unlikely that we will witness a massive upward surge during this period.

During Monday's trading session, Bitcoin witnessed a remarkable surge, breaking through the critical $40,000 threshold.

This increase is largely attributed to the widespread belief among traders that the Federal Reserve is likely to start reducing interest rates as soon as March. Additionally, the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC is expected to further drive demand for Bitcoin. Despite these optimistic forecasts, there remains uncertainty around Bitcoin's primary function beyond speculation.

From a technical analysis perspective, the momentum gained by Bitcoin suggests a continued upward trajectory following this significant breakthrough. The $40,000 level, which previously served as a resistance point, is now anticipated to become a major support level. This shift is underpinned by the concept of ""market memory,"" indicating that traders may seize opportunities to re-enter the market at this level, recognizing it as a point of value All Buy Impossible

The current sentiment strongly discourages shorting Bitcoin . The 20-Day EMA, indicated in blue on the chart, is expected to provide short-term support and act as a market floor in case of any pullback. However, a significant pullback seems unlikely at this stage, and it is widely believed that Bitcoin will soon reach the $45,000 mark. Because of this, I am a buyer overall – right along with almost everyone else it seems.

The trajectory of Bitcoin is closely tied to interest rate movements in the United States. An increase in interest rates could potentially have adverse effects on Bitcoin's value. Currently, the bond market appears to be pressuring the Federal Reserve into rapid rate cuts, which, if realized, could channel more ""cheap and easy money"" into the cryptocurrency markets, fueling speculation and volatility. However, the forthcoming bull market in cryptocurrency may exhibit less intensity and volatility compared to previous ones, given the increasing involvement of institutional investors.

This analysis underscores the significant impact of macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and market speculation, on Bitcoin's performance. The potential for Bitcoin ETFs and the role of institutional investors are key considerations in forecasting Bitcoin's market behavior and understanding its evolving landscape in the broader financial ecosystem. All of these things put together suggests that we are going to continue to see a lot of noise, but overall, a general situation where we go higher over time.

Cryptocurrency market capitalisation changed little at the end of trading on Wednesday, remaining close to $1.59 trillion (-0.14%

d/d). But this modest result is a show of strength, given the pressure in equity markets, which intensified selling in Bitcoin and Ether.

Meanwhile, Altcoins got their chance to catch up with the leaders. For example, XRP added 2% in 24h) and Cardano added 4%.

XRP has formed an upward trend since mid-October. An attempt to accelerate growth last month failed, but it also failed to break this line at the start of December. In addition to the trend line, the 50-day moving average, the touch of which stops the sell-off for the last 50 days, also turned out to be on the side of buyers.

Since the beginning of this year, the number of BTC addresses holding the cryptocurrency has increased by 20 per cent to more than 50 million, Santiment noted. BTC's growth is fuelled by the drop of its supply on exchanges to a six-year low.

Bitcoin has moved into the acceleration phase of the bull market, but the situation remains largely within its early stages, Glassnode noted. BTC's 142% YTD growth is consistent with the 2015-2017 and 2018-2022 cycles. Most bitcoin investors have entered the plus side, with several on-chain indicators moving into enthusiastic stage territory in an uptrend.

Coinbase crypto exchange CEO Brian Armstrong called bitcoin a great alternative to the US dollar and other fiat currencies. According to him, BTC can be an antidote to inflation.

The US SEC has asked the court to clarify whether the crypto assets sold by Terraform Labs are unregistered securities. The regulator strongly believes that these cryptocurrencies meet the criteria of securities.

With traditional finance out of reach, cryptocurrencies act as an alternative, especially in emerging markets and younger populations, the ECB study said.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the most successful meme cryptocurrency, is ten years old. It was created by programmer Billy Marcus and engineer Jackson Palmer as a parody of Bitcoin. DOGE has jumped 16% this week, hitting highs over the past year above $0.106.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis last Monday that with the price of Bitcoin breaking strongly on healthy volatility with firmly bullish daily candles to new long-term highs, it was worth taking notice and trying to come along for the ride with a long trade. Significant bullish breakouts were one of the signals I was looking for.

This was a great call as the price continued to rise and made a significant bullish breakout the very next day to rise by another $2,000 or so to make a new long-term high above $44,000.

This strong advance to new long-term highs has faltered now, and in recent hours we have seen a sharp drop followed by a bounce off the support level below the current price at $41,706.

It might be that Bitcoin is a good long-term buy at this level, but the drop from the highs printed several new resistance levels which may be hard to break. The best approach might be to enter any bounces off support as long trades but be prepared to treat them like short-term trades if they do not perform well quickly.

It will be interesting to see whether Bitcoin now holds its low, or breakdown down again and continues to fall. A break below $40,907 could see the price quickly test the $40k area. Such a breakdown would suggest that the bullish trend will fail to advance any further for a while.

There is nothing of high importance scheduled today regarding the US Dollar.

Bitcoin price is hovering near its highest level since April 2022 as the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) in the crypto industry continued. The BTC/USD pair rose to the important resistance point of 45,000 on Wednesday. It has surged by over 184% from the lowest level in December 2022 following the collapse of FTX continues

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong uptrend, helped by the FOMO among investors. In most periods, a surge of Bitcoin price usually leads to more upside as investors attempt to join the rally. This explains why most altcoins have been in a strong rally.

Bitcoin has been doing well helped by three main factors. First, there are signs that institutions are buying Bitcoin in the past few months. MicroStrategy, the biggest BTC holder, has continued adding to its position.

Second, Bitcoin has rallied after several companies filed for a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Some of these companies are Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco, which are specialists in ETFs.

Combined, these companies hold over $12 trillion in total assets under management (AUM). Some of these firms, including Blackrock, have started seeding their funds in preparation of the eventual approval.

Finally, Bitcoin is soaring as traders reflect on the falling bond yields in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The 10-year yield dropped to 4.10% while the 30-year yield moved from the year-to-date high of 5% to 4.21%.

Further, the price of crude oil continued plunging. Brent dropped to $74.5 while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) moved to $69.57, the lowest level in five months. This is a positive thing since it will have a positive impact on inflation. Therefore, the Fed will likely start cutting rates in the coming months/USD technical analysis

The BTC/USD pair has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. On the daily chart, it has moved above the 50-day moving average. This is a sign that bulls are in control. At the same time, the Stochastic Oscillator has moved to the overbought level. The MACD indicator and the histogram have moved to the neutral point.

Further, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has continued rising. Therefore, the outlook for the pair is bullish, with the next price to watch being at 46,000. The stop-loss of this trade is at 42,000.

This optimism centered around the potent","(MENAFN- The Rio Times) Bitcoin's rise in late 2023, reaching its highest yearly prices, was fueled by market optimism.



This optimism centered around the potential approval of spot-price ETFs in the United States.



However, 2024 may see Bitcoin's value increase without relying on these ETFs. Markus Tielen, head of research at Matrixport , shared his insights in a recent report.



He believes Bitcoin will benefit from a more favorable macroeconomic climate in 2024.



This situation, coupled with an important update in Bitcoin's protocol, is expected to drive its price higher than in 2023.



Tielen underscores the significance of understanding the macroeconomic environment for predicting market evolution.



He notes that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, tend to struggle in low liquidity environments. However, they thrive when there's a shift in liquidity expectations.







This dynamic was the key driver behind Bitcoin' performance for most of 2023.



The Federal Reserve's recent indication of an end to interest rate hikes and potential rate cuts in 2024 adds to this favorable outlook.



Tielen draws parallels to 2019 when the end of a Fed rate hike cycle led to a near 300% increase in Bitcoin's price.



Although the Fed projects three cuts in 2024, a discrepancy remains between inflation rates and interest rates.

Bitcoin's market dominance

Additionally, 2024 will witness another Bitcoin halving event. Historically, Bitcoin's price has seen substantial increases following such events.



Tielen projects this trend will continue, offering room for further price appreciation.



Tielen concludes that even without the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, higher cryptocurrency prices are likely.



He advises investors to watch Bitcoin's market dominance, as a decline might signal a rise in alternative cryptocurrencies.

This downward movement extended beyond Bitcoin, affecting several other prominent digital currencies, including Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, and Polka Dot. Notably, major digital currencies collectively recorded a decline of at least 4 percent, representing the most substantial downturn since November.



The broader correction in the digital currency markets aligns with Coinglass data, revealing that approximately USD312 million worth of trading positions were liquidated in December. This figure marks the highest liquidation amount since September, underscoring the widespread impact of the market correction.



Investors are closely monitoring key factors as they navigate the turbulent digital currency landscape. The upcoming release of US inflation data and the Federal Reserve meeting are poised to be significant events that could test market expectations regarding potential interest rate cuts.



In tandem with the overall market sentiment, Bitcoin's value dwindled to USD40,868, accompanied by a decrease in trading volume to USD25.76 billion over the last 24 hours. The past week has seen Bitcoin lose approximately 6.52 percent of its value, adding to the uncertainties surrounding the digital currency landscape.



Other major digital currencies, such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Cardano, also experienced varying degrees of price declines throughout the day.

On Monday, the leading cryptocurrency in market value fell by up to 7.5%, marking its largest intraday drop since August 18.



However, by 9:25 AM (Brasília time), the losses were reduced to around 3.3%, with Bitcoin trading at $42,335.



Other major cryptocurrencies also experienced declines. The top 100 digital asset index recorded its lowest point since November 22.



On Wednesday, Bitcoin approached the significant $44,000 mark, marking its longest streak of continuous gains since May.



Richard Galvin, co-founder of Sydney-based Digital Asset Capital Management, notes to Bloomberg Linea, ""Market leverage has increased notably.""



He believes the current drop is more about market deleveraging than any fundamental catalyst.







Data from Coinglass reveals that about $312 million in crypto trading positions, betting on higher prices, were liquidated by December 11, 4:15 AM (Brasília time).



This amount is the largest since at least mid-September. Bitcoin has been in the spotlight this year.



Investors anticipate U.S. regulators will approve the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly tied to the currency.



This move could broaden the investor base in cryptocurrencies.



Expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024 have also fueled the rally.

Investors are now focused on upcoming U.S. inflation data

Investors are now focused on upcoming U.S. inflation data and the Federal Reserve's final 2023 policy meeting. Both events could challenge aggressive bets on rate cuts.



On Monday, global stocks and U.S. stock futures show mixed performance. Meanwhile, a U.S. dollar index rises, indicating cautious sentiment.



Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia Pty, finds it prudent to see some profit-taking.



He expects any drops toward the $37,500 to $40,000 range to be well-supported by ""dip buyers."" These investors capitalize on price drops to buy at lower rates.



Year-over-year, Bitcoin has surged over 150%, driving a broader recovery in digital asset prices following a $1.5 trillion slump in 2022.



However, the currency remains well below its pandemic-era peak of nearly $69,000, set just over two years ago.

OKX Wallet Enhances Accessibility for Bitcoin DApps



OKX Wallet today introduced an upgrade to its 'Discover ' platform with the implementation of Bitcoin's Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) signature function. PSBT is a Bitcoin standard that facilitates the portability of unsigned transactions, enabling multiple parties to easily sign the same transaction.



Until today, OKX Wallet's Discover users encountered limitations when trying to utilize BTC-related DApps due to the absence of a PSBT signature function within the OKX Wallet. With the latest update, users can now seamlessly connect to and interact with Bitcoin DApps such as UniSat, Magic Eden and idclub directly through Discover. In addition, OKX Wallet users can now display their transaction histories for Bitcoin-related DApps.



OKX Wallet's Discover platform gathers over 5,500+ DApps, DEXs, blockchain games, NFTs and supplementary tools.

Having surged more than 160 percent this year, Bitcoin traded above USD44,200 on Saturday, a substantial increase from its value of USD16,500 at the beginning of the year.



'It feels that [2023] was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25,' chief executive officer of Ledger, Pascal Gauthier, was cited as declaring by the media outlet.



In November 2021, Bitcoin reached a peak of nearly USD69,000. However, the crypto market experienced a significant setback last year, losing almost USD1.4 trillion, primarily due to bankruptcies in the sector. FTX, the world's second-largest crypto exchange at the time, played a central role in the crisis, collapsing and leading to its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, facing potential imprisonment for over 100 years after being convicted on seven counts of criminal fraud.



Adding to the challenges in the crypto sector, Changpeng Zhao, the chief of Binance, pleaded guilty to criminal charges last month and resigned as the company's CEO as part of a USD4.3 billion-settlement with the US Department of Justice.



The former leader of the world's largest crypto exchange is now at risk of up to ten years in prison for money laundering.



As reported by the news agency, several industry specialists 'see the two cases concluding as a line being drawn under issues that have plagued the crypto market.'



Analysts also predict that the upcoming Bitcoin ""halving,"" a scheduled event occurring approximately every four years to restrict the cryptocurrency's supply, is poised to be a catalyst for further price increases.

UPCX is a cryptoc","(MENAFN- TimesNewswire ) As the anticipation of Bitcoin halving grows, newcomer UPCX in the crypto payment sector has garnered widespread market attention. UPCX is a cryptocurrency designed to streamline online transactions and offer low transaction fees, utilizing the latest blockchain technology to provide fast and secure payment solutions. With Bitcoin halving potentially increasing investor interest in emerging projects, UPCX's unique value proposition and early-stage positioning offer an intriguing opportunity for early investors.







Bitcoin Halving and its Synergistic Effect on the Payment Race

As the Bitcoin halving event approaches, the market often reacts in advance, historically signaling the start of a bull market. The halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, prompting a price increase. This anticipation not only attracts investment in Bitcoin itself but also positively impacts the entire cryptocurrency market. Against this backdrop, payment channels, as the most direct application scenarios and a vital component of the blockchain ecosystem and Web3 architecture, naturally become a preferred investment focus.

Payment race projects demonstrate the practical application of blockchain technology in real-world financial transactions by offering fast, low-cost cross-border payment solutions, which are essential for building decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3. Amid the market frenzy stirred by Bitcoin halving, these payment projects receive additional attention and investment due to their potential to improve payment efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and provide more transparent and inclusive financial services, along with high practicality and project implementation expectations.

Therefore, with the emerging investor interest in Bitcoin halving and the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market, projects in the payment race are expected not only to drive the widespread adoption of blockchain technology but also to accelerate the development of the Web3 ecosystem.

We can look back at some critical historical cases. After Bitcoin's first halving in 2012, Litecoin, known as the'silver to Bitcoin's gold,' began to gain attention in the community due to its faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees, being seen as a more suitable choice for everyday transactions. With the market heat triggered by Bitcoin halving, the investment and user adoption of payment-focused cryptocurrencies like Litecoin significantly rose.

By the second halving in 2016, the market had matured. Not only did traditional payment cryptocurrencies like Litecoin benefit, but platforms like Ethereum also created new possibilities for payment and decentralized finance (DeFi) with their smart contract capabilities. The emergence of payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase Commerce also showed the active development of the payment race post-halving.

The 2020 halving further intensified this trend, with projects like Stellar and Ripple gaining market attention for their cross-border payment and financial inclusivity capabilities, especially Stellar's collaboration with IBM on the World Wire project, showcasing the strong application potential of blockchain technology in the global payment domain. Overall, Bitcoin's halving events have increased its scarcity and deepened market recognition of the potential value of the entire cryptocurrency industry, driving innovation and growth in payment-related projects.







Bitcoin Halving Brings Opportunities for UPCX

In the context of Bitcoin halving, investors look for innovative and high-growth potential startups in the payment sector, hoping to capitalize on the heightened market sentiment and increased liquidity.

Projects like UPCX could garner significant attention and favor from investors now. The uplift in awareness can help UPCX stand out in the payment space, and it might even replicate the success of projects like Stellar and Ripple during previous cycles, becoming a breakthrough force in the new round of the payment race.

Why UPCX?

1 Payment Solutions

UPCX's innovative payment solutions reflect the ongoing evolution in the fintech space. The platform's well-designed financial smart contracts not only streamline traditional blockchain payment processes but also bring unprecedented flexibility and automation, making recurrent payments and scheduled payouts effortless. This feature is particularly valuable for those who need to handle recurring bills and subscriptions. Moreover, the authorized automatic withdrawals further reduce the financial management burden on users, potentially attracting those inconvenienced by manual payment processes.

Introducing non-custodial escrow and multi-signature authority payments ensures transaction security while giving users direct control over payment. These features are a strong draw for those skeptical of traditional financial institutions or seeking a higher degree of financial autonomy.

Moreover, UPCX's anonymous account and transfer capabilities ensure the security of users' identities and transaction data, which is particularly important for those who place a high value on privacy protection. Additionally, the convenience of mobile payments with QR code scanning, tap-to-pay technologies, and the ability to conduct payments in an offline setting through dual-offline payment capabilities are robust supplements to current payment scenarios.

Bringing these features together, UPCX forms a comprehensive blockchain payment solution. It addresses many of the shortcomings of existing blockchain payments while having the potential to open up new market spaces, providing both users and businesses with a more efficient, secure, and convenient payment option.

2 Market Positioning







UPCX's market positioning is precise and focused on addressing critical issues such as blockchain payments, cross-border payments, stablecoin value stability, and financial inclusion. By offering a comprehensive super-app, UPCX goes beyond being a blockchain platform that solves payment difficulties. It aims to provide users with a seamless and diversified financial experience, including everyday payment transactions, smart contract-based scheduled payments, and transactions that can proceed even offline. In the context of a highly competitive cryptocurrency market and halving scenarios, UPCX's market positioning helps it stand out among many blockchain projects, offering unique value propositions to its users. As the digital economy evolves and user demands become increasingly complex, UPCX's comprehensive and user-friendly approach is crucial in realizing its long-term vision and market success.

3 and Market

Since the release of its white paper, the UPCX project has rapidly gained global attention, with its community growing to two hundred thousand members within just two months, spanning key markets such as Southeast Asia, North America, Europe, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Russia, Turkey, and more. This explosive growth not only demonstrates the global appeal of the UPCX project but also reflects the market's eager anticipation for this innovative payment solution.







In the cryptocurrency industry, especially at critical junctures like Bitcoin halving, an active community is essential for enhancing a project's visibility and establishing trust. UPCX relies on its large and active community base, through the active participation and promotion of its members, to be well-prepared for the upcoming market changes and to strive for breakthroughs in a highly competitive market environment.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, UPCX's opening price was $0.25, and its current price has surged to $1.20, representing an increase of over 400%. Such performance not only shows its strong market performance but also further fuels the interest of community members and potential investors, making UPCX one of the most notable cryptocurrency projects in the market.







4 Model

The UPCX project has set a relatively low total supply of 780 million tokens, which appears more scarce compared to the supply of some mature payment projects like XLM and XRP. This supply strategy provides UPCX with considerable room for potential price growth. According to historical market trends, newly listed payment projects often go through a value discovery phase in the early stages, where the price is relatively stable. However, as the project reaches development milestones, such as significant product updates or establishing new partnerships, it usually triggers a period of token price growth.







Based on UPCX's development roadmap, the project is expected to enter a phase of accelerated growth in the first quarter of 2024. Moreover, influenced by the Bitcoin halving event, the entire cryptocurrency industry typically experiences a cycle of increased enthusiasm, with payment solutions particularly in focus. In such an environment, UPCX, as an innovative payment project, has the potential for rapid value growth, with its price capable of achieving several times or even more than tenfold increases.

UPCX has also introduced a staking reward mechanism to promote the long-term value growth of the token. Over the next 50 years, approximately 242 million UPCX tokens will be released as rewards to staking users, encouraging them to hold and participate in the UPCX ecosystem for the long term. This staking strategy not only fosters user participation but also helps support and drive a steady rise in the price of UPCX tokens over a long time.

Summary

As the Bitcoin halving heralds industry transformation and heightened investor interest, UPCX is quietly positioning itself at the forefront of a new wave of opportunity. The much-watched UPCX not only has the chance to capitalize on the rising market sentiment and the influx of capital for rapid, short-term growth but also, in the long run, it is poised to make significant contributions to the development of the digital economy through its innovative payment solutions and the advantage of low transaction fees, making it a promising prospect for the market.



UPCX is a global payment solution powered by blockchain technology. It provides a fully integrated, efficient, and multifunctional financial ecosystem designed to create a faster, more secure, and more affordable solution for global financial transactions. The core currency of UPCX is UPC, which is designed for performance, scalability, and settlement integrity comparable to credit card and mobile payment systems.

The proceeds generated from these bonds are earmarked for funding the ambitious ""Bitcoin City"" project. The National Bitcoin Office, responsible for overseeing cryptocurrency-related initiatives, has confirmed that the Volcano Bond has received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission. The issuance is anticipated to take place within the initial quarter of 2024.



El Salvador made history in 2021 when it declared Bitcoin as legal tender, a decision spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele. This groundbreaking move aimed to streamline financial transfers and extend financial services to the approximately 70 percent of Salvadorans lacking access to traditional banking.



As part of Bukele's broader strategy to integrate technology and environmental sustainability, the concept of constructing a ""Bitcoin City"" in eastern El Salvador was unveiled in 2021. This city is envisioned to harness thermal energy generated by local volcanoes, aligning with El Salvador's commitment to innovative and eco-friendly development.



Notably, the Salvadoran government has actively engaged with Bitcoin, making strategic purchases of the cryptocurrency. In July 2022, El Salvador acquired 80 Bitcoins, signaling its ongoing commitment to incorporating digital assets into its financial ecosystem. President Bukele has further affirmed the nation's resolve to continue daily Bitcoin acquisitions from November 2022 onward.



This latest initiative of issuing Bitcoin bonds underscores El Salvador's pioneering approach to integrating cryptocurrency into its economic landscape, marking a significant step toward realizing the vision of a technologically advanced and sustainable ""Bitcoin City.""",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_14.jpg,False,@menafn,7.0633717,29a6b4185e6c9bd0f94361c87a09810a

The cryptocurrency's price dropped over 7 percent to USD40,887.81, as reported by Coinbase, following a substantial decrease on Sunday night that saw it briefly dip to USD40,300. Bitcoin had reached above USD44,000 the previous week and traded just below that level over the weekend.



In tandem, ether fell by 7 percent to USD2,202.92, while Solana's SOL token and Ripple's XRP both recorded 7 percent and 8 percent declines, respectively. According to Coin Metrics, both bitcoin and ether were on track for their worst performance days since August 18 and March 9, respectively.



Cryptocurrency-related equities also faced downward pressure, with Coinbase dropping around 5 percent, MicroStrategy losing 7 percent, and bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital experiencing double-digit declines of 11 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Wall Street favorites CleanSpark and Iris Energy were down nearly 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively.



These movements followed a 12 percent increase for bitcoin in December, driven by growing expectations that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in early January. Galaxy Digital estimates the potential market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF to be around USD14 trillion in the first year post-launch, expanding to approximately USD26 trillion in the second year.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_15.jpg,False,@menafn,6.8011384,ebdd7aa7fd004426983fd0f475a097a7

Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) is selling out fast as traders grab the coin at the lowest price before the crypto bull run explodes when a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the US SEC.

The Bitcoin price has consolidated above $42,000 after briefly touching $45,000 in a show of strength that has fired the starting gun on what could be the biggest-ever digital assets price explosion.

As the spot Bitcoin ETF frenzy goes into overdrive, the Bitcoin ETF Token raises more than $4m

Continue Reading

The Bitcoin ETF Token presale has entered its 10th and final stage, so there are only days left to buy at the cheapest available price of $0.0068.

As the FOMO around the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF continues to mount, traders have poured $4.1 million into the $BTCETF initial coin offering. There is now less than $800,000 to raise to reach the hard cap goal of

$4,956,000.

Contributors to the presale could see returns that go parabolic with 100x gains, such is the anticipation surrounding the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF transforming the investment landscape for crypto.

The Bitcoin ETF Token

provides the answer to the question of how to best position investment portfolios to benefit from a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which is likely coming as soon as January.

The Ethereum-based coin is explicitly crafted with burn mechanisms triggered by ETF approval, launch and other milestones, such as trading volumes and assets under management.

In other words, at every major step on the journey from approval to launch and market take-up, owners of the $BTCETF token will directly benefit.

Such will be the seismic impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Google has already moved to change its advertising rules on crypto to allow for fund managers issuing the products to be able to promote them.

Bitcoin ETF will be at the center of the BlackRock v Vanguard struggle for ETF supremacy

With an expected 'crypto super cycle' about to explode, the cryptocurrency asset class could find itself at the center of an arms race among fund managers to be the top dog.

BlackRock is the No. 1 ETF issuer but passive investment pioneer Vanguard is not far behind. Crypto is emerging as a key battleground as the two heavyweights vie for ETF supremacy in a market that in the US alone is worth $7.8 trillion .

BlackRock has performed a U-turn on crypto after previously dismissing the asset class while Vanguard remains in the doubters' camp. Crypto could be part of BlackRock's master plan to stay out in front of its rivals – success with that ploy could force Vanguard's arm.

If Vanguard does at some point next year decide to succumb to pressure from clients (and asset manager competitors) and start issuing crypto ETFs, expect another huge injection of liquidity into digital asset markets.

In another significant development, BlackRock, following a meeting with the SEC, has revised its ETF filing application

in such a way that it would allow banks to sidestep not being allowed to hold crypto on their balance sheets. BlackRock's new proposal allows a custodian – in this case Coinbase Custody – to hold crypto on behalf of the banks. By becoming Authorized Participants, banks would be able to directly swap cash for crypto assets.

However, the wind in the sails of the Bitcoin ETF Token

is not purely down to the prospects for Bitcoin ETFs but also Bitcoin's wider claim to be a store of value.

Although Vanguard may doubt crypto is a viable asset class and bemoan its volatility as a reason for steering clear, a look around the world finds a growing list of countries where its citizens increasingly recognize Bitcoin's utility as a store of value.

Bitcoin is a world-changing store of value and Bitcoin ETF Token can reap the upside



A recent X post by the Canadian restaurant business Tahini's makes the point very well. In a post yesterday it highlights that 725 million people in six countries (Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon and Pakistan) are witnessing Bitcoin trading at all-time-highs against bombed-out local currencies.

Buying $BTCETF today is not just a short-term bet on the SEC approving a spot product but a longer-term positioning for a pivotal economic and financial moment. There are highly likely to be more countries joining the list above as peak-globalization turns into an economic downturn in key countries such as China, the second-largest economy on the planet and still the primary workshop of the world.

In addition, the supply shock from the halving of Bitcoin block rewards paid to miners to 3.25 BTC at the same time as demand increases, means Bitcoin could settle at a price above $1 million.

The chances of Bitcoin becoming an official reserve currency for citizens suffering from dying local currencies or who are locked out of the traditional financial landscape are rising.

Bitcoin derivative coins such as Bitcoin ETF Token

are set to reap the benefits of the deep secular transformation of economies and finance that Bitcoin will be at the center of.

Here's how the Bitcoin ETF Token adds value at every milestone

A shrinking total supply by as much as 25% increases the scarcity of the Bitcoin ETT Token, making it a stronger value proposition. For each of the first five milestones, the transaction tax decreases by 1% from a starting level of 5%.

5 steps to Bitcoin ETF riches:



$BTCETF hits a trading volume of $100 million

SEC approves the first spot Bitcoin ETF

First spot Bitcoin ETF launches in the US

Bitcoin ETF assets under management hits $1 billion Bitcoin price closes daily candle above $100,000

Bitcoin ETF Token is ""like nothing you have ever seen"" – 10x gains at launch, 100x to come?

The Bitcoin ETF Token presale run rate is speeding up, so there is no time to lose to grab what could be an initial 10x return opportunity. Given the token's unique position in the market, popular analysts have spotted the opportunity and have been informing their audiences.

As the Bitcoin ETF approval FOMO grows, YouTube crypto analysts are turning up the heat.

Austin Hilton has told his 239,000 YouTube channel subscribers that the Bitcoin ETF Token

is like ""nothing you have ever seen before"", describing its milestone burn mechanism as ""very cool"".

New Crypto Project! Bitcoin ETF Project! Very Cool! LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN!

Similarly, YouTube crypto expert Jacob Crypto Bury is eyeing $BTCETF for big gains – he predicts a 10x move when it launches on decentralized exchanges:

BTC ETF Token Raises $2,000,000 (Best Crypto to Buy Now?!)

Conor Kenny has let his 170,000 audience of subscribers know about the innovative rewards mechanism's link to Bitcoin ETF approval and associated milestones. He suggests it is one of the best ways available to play this crypto investment theme. As altcoin season surges, 10x gains could be 100x for those who ride the coming wave of capital appreciation.

BTCETF Crypto | A Token Rewarding Holders As Bitcoin ETFs Are Approved!!

Crypto will be a growing slice of a $14 trillion ETF pie – and Bitcoin ETF Token is the easiest way to gain exposure

Visit the Bitcoin ETF Token website and join on X (Twitter)

and Telegram

to stay up to date with project developments. The website has an excellent news ticker, so you will always be first to hear market-moving news about spot Bitcoin ETFs.

To invest in the presale, connect your crypto wallet, set the amount you wish to invest and pay with ETH, BNB, MATIC or USDT. You can also contribute to the presale the old-fashioned way by using your bank card.

As mentioned, 10x returns are well within bounds for a coin that has already put its stamp on the 'Bitcoin ETF' theme, but much larger returns could be in store for those who hold for the long term.

Bitcoin could do for financial markets what gold did for ETFs after the first index fund for the yellow metal launched in 2003. The global ETF market is forecast to be valued at $14 trillion by the end of 2024.

Crypto will be a growing share of that total and buying Bitcoin ETF Token

is probably the smartest way to gain exposure to the investment returns to come.

Institutional Investors

NEW YORK, Dec. 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --

Hyperion Decimus (HD), a digital asset management firm and a sponsor of a multi-strategy crypto hedge fund, and

CoinDesk Indices (CDI) , a subsidiary of CoinDesk and the leading provider of digital asset indices by AUM since 2014, announced today the launch of the HD CoinDesk TrendMax Strategy. This quantitative trading strategy is built on weighted signals from CoinDesk Indices' proprietary

Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) and

Ether Trend Indicator (ETI) , which each convey the presence, direction and strength of the trend in the price of bitcoin and ether respectively by using purpose-built, non-discretionary algorithms.

The HD CoinDesk TrendMax Strategy seeks to address the crypto market's volatility and regulatory challenges that institutional investors have typically faced when conducting due diligence for investing in digital assets. The HD portfolio management team utilizes a quantitative signal that is fundamentally weighted and actively managed through a disciplined process free of human emotion. The systematic approach delivers a liquid alternative investment solution that can seamlessly rotate among bitcoin, ether, or cash according to the BTI and ETI signal indicators. This strategy is a uniquely designed actively managed approach offered through separately managed accounts (SMAs).

""Our collaboration with CoinDesk Indices helps enable our investors to confidently allocate to crypto across all market conditions,"" said Chris Sullivan, Co-Founder and Portfolio Manager of HD. ""Crafting a transparent and more sustainable long term investment option for digital asset investing is the next step in our shared mission to deliver institutional-grade cryptocurrency strategies.""

""We're excited to partner with HD as they offer, for the very first time, an actively managed alternative investment strategy supported by our popular and powerful trend indicators,"" said Andy Baehr, CFA, Managing Director at CoinDesk Indices. ""The HD CoinDesk TrendMax Strategy provides the potential for lower risk, higher return exposure to bitcoin and ether due to price momentum and driven by HD's implementation alpha.""



The trend indicators are used as a way to pursue uncorrelated returns. The BTI and ETI each broadcast one of five possible daily values, each corresponding to an indicated direction and strength of trend in the price of bitcoin or ether. The indicator is calculated daily based on historical price information and a non-discretionary methodology. The indicators seek to identify trends in the price of bitcoin or ether by comparing recent prices to older prices over a recent historical period. If recent prices are higher, an uptrend might be indicated; if recent prices are lower, a downtrend may be in place.

This investment strategy is based on DDA research findings, offering investors comprehensive exposure to Bitcoin dependent on macroeconomic conditions
 
This index marks the first step of DDA in launching smart beta strategies in an ETP format, incorporating principles from traditional asset management
 
FRANKFURT, Germany, Dec. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA), a German digital asset manager, has partnered with Compass Financial Technologies, the leading Swiss-based, BMR-registered independent index provider, to introduce
 a revolutionary Bitcoin investment strategy 
with the launch of the DDA Bitcoin Macro Allocation Index (DDAMACRO Index). This index dynamically adjusts exposure between Bitcoin and USD in response to key macroeconomic factors and notably, stands as the 
world's first index leveraging macroeconomic indicators to regulate Bitcoin exposure.
 
In October 2022, DDA released a notable research paper on 
Crypto Assets and the Macroeconomy
 revealing that 4 major economic factors, on average, explain 83% of Bitcoin's long-term price movements, establishing Bitcoin as a macroeconomic asset. Leveraging the findings of this research, DDA and Compass FT present an index solution designed to provide investors with comprehensive exposure to Bitcoin, based on macroeconomic factors as indicated by their explanatory power at a given time. In instances where these factors do not align, the divested portion is strategically allocated to USD.
 
Marc des Ligneris, who is in charge of quantitative strategies at Deutsche Digital Assets, emphasizes the strategy's potential, stating, ""This strategy exploits the fact that, until now, every crypto winter has been at least partially explained by major macroeconomic factors. As long as this is the case, this strategy should perform well. We believe it can help passive investors to better manage their risk over the long run.""
 
'We are thrilled to partner with Deutsche Digital Assets for the first time and accompany them on releasing this unprecedented, innovative solution,' says Guillaume le Fur, CEO of Compass Financial Technologies. 'This new index integrates relevant, key macroeconomic factors, enabling investors to skillfully manage their exposure to Bitcoin amidst diverse market conditions.'
 
This strategic initiative represents the first in a forthcoming series of smart beta strategies, designed to diversify from conventional passive strategies with the objective to make these available to investors through traditional structures such as an ETP.

self

In the U.S. where rules differ from state to state, it's important to work with clients during a data incident to ensure their response follows the rules of the state(s) where their users live, Richardson said.

""If the data subjects are all in one state, it's easy, but of course that's not realistic,"" he said. ""And we've got to deal with basically 54 regimes – that's all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the USVI,"" he said. ""And each of them has slightly different definitions of what data is, slightly different definitions of a breach, slightly different notification requirements, slightly different time limits for those notification requirements. But mercifully, for any person that comes to us, Morgan and I do this on a daily basis, so we are perfectly capable and happy to analyze the data, analyze the breach and give a very capable and thorough understanding of what has gone on.""

Jones added that it's important for companies to not sit on a breach and try to figure it out on their own, because once it's discovered, the clock starts ticking on the reporting requirements. He said some states have notification requirements that fall between the 30- and 60-day window, but there are a few where you have to notify either the regulator or the individuals within 10 days or so.

After a breach happens, it's also possible for a company to face investigations into their protocol, depending on the situation, Jones explained.

In discussing how future data privacy regulations may apply to the blockchain industry, Jones said there are some implicit contradictions between GDPR requirements of the right for data to be deleted and blockchain ledgers that are immutable. For now, Jones noted that regulators are extremely focused on artificial intelligence but may turn their attentions back to blockchain and cryptocurrency in the future.

He believes the regulations for blockchain will require a different approach than AI because of the ways the different technologies collect and use data.

""I think the general intention of the legislators right now has been turned away a bit to focus more on AI – that's the hot button topic right now – but I think they will eventually circle back to blockchain,"" Jones said. ""I think they'll take a softer touch to it than AI because AI data is being collected and shared in many instances without the consumer knowing. Whereas blockchain you're opening yourself up to this. So I think it's going to take a bit of a lighter touch and it won't be quite so drastic when it comes to cryptocurrency.""

Lennon said people who choose to buy crypto are generally very focused on the importance of data privacy, but that doesn't make it any easier to enforce those rules.

""For the crypto industry and blockchain advocates, the immutability and the decentralized aspects perhaps add to an inability to comply, but also an inability to enforce in some ways,"" Lennon said. ""I know that privacy is important to individuals in the cryptocurrency space, there's privacy coins, there's zero-knowledge proof being integrated into some projects, maybe that, in some ways, is where the blockchain technology is headed in the future.""

Bitcoin's recent trading activity has been a topic of much interest, especially during Thursday's session. The cryptocurrency displayed a mix of ups and downs, indicating a bullish trend yet hinting at a possible consolidation phase after its significant upward journey. A key point of observation is the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which currently aligns with the $40,000 mark. This level is not only a notable support point due to the EMA but also because of its psychological significance. The $40,000 threshold, a round figure, has previously acted as a crucial pivot point, influencing market reactions upon its breach.

Looking upwards, the $45,000 level emerges as another significant milestone. Similar to the $40,000 mark, this too is a round figure that holds psychological importance and has previously acted as a resistance point in the market. Surpassing this level could pave the way towards $47,500, a target that has historical relevance and has previously witnessed considerable selling pressure. A breakthrough above $47,500 could further extend Bitcoin's rally, potentially reaching the $50,000 landmark Banks and BTC

The market's current dynamics seem to be largely influenced by anticipations regarding central banks' monetary policies. There's a growing belief that these institutions might adopt a more lenient approach, which traditionally benefits Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has often thrived under loose monetary conditions, and recent market trends suggest an expectation that central banks might ease their policies. This speculation has been a key driver in Bitcoin's recent movements.

However, the trajectory of Bitcoin is not without its uncertainties. The market remains sensitive to broader economic factors and any major shift towards a 'risk-off' sentiment could potentially disrupt this upward trend. Such events could trigger a reverse in Bitcoin's gains, demonstrating the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.

In the end, Bitcoin's journey is marked by significant levels at $40,000, $45,000, and potentially $47,500 and $50,000, each holding their own importance in terms of technical and psychological impact. The market's reaction to central banks' monetary policies remains a critical factor in determining Bitcoin's future movements. Yet, as with any investment in crypto space, unpredictability and sensitivity to global economic sentiments continue to play a major role. Furthermore, the market is likely to see a lot of questions asked of it. This market needs a lot of risk taking by traders to continue going higher – but with the Fed easing next year, it makes sense that BTC rallies longer-term.

Bullish view

The BTC/USD price continued to consolidate as traders waited for the next catalyst and as others started taking profits. Bitcoin retreated to $42,153 on Wednesday morning, a few points below this week's high of $43,480 ETF hopes

Bitcoin retreated even as investors embraced a risk-on sentiment during the American session. The US dollar index retreated to $101.77 while the 10-year and 30-year bond yields dropped to 3.92% and 4.03%, respectively. The CBOE VIX index, which is a well-known fear guage in Wall Street dropped by 1.5% to $12.37.

US equities also bounced back, with the Dow Jones rising by over 200. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices rose by more than 0.50%. In most cases, Bitcoin tends to move in the same direction as US equities.

The biggest Bitcoin story of this week was that Blackrock filed an amendment to its spot Bitcoin ETF in a bid to appease the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The new amendment will see the company set cash redemption and creation mechanisms in a bid to protect customers.

The SEC has long supported the redemption mechanism. Therefore, there is a likelihood that it will approve the spot ETF in the next few weeks or months. In a recent statement, Gary Gensler noted that the agency was reviewing the recent Grayscale lawsuit to determine whether it will approve the ETFs.

Bitcoin has rallied in the past few months as investors anticipated future rate cuts and ETF approvals. The Fed has already hinted that it will slash rates in 2024. The next catalyst for the coin is the growing market share for Bitcoin Ordinals and next year's halving.

Bitcoin Ordinals have become so successful that they have overtaken Ethereum NFTs in terms of sales/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin price dropped to a low of $40,000 last week and has struggled to bounce back. This attempt found a strong resistance at $43,476, where it struggled to move above since December 13th.

Bitcoin is also consolidating at the 25-period and 50-period moving averages while the Average True Range (ATR) has moved sideways. The ATR is one of the most popular volatility indicators.

Therefore, the BTC/USD pair will likely remain between the support at 40,000 and the resistance at 43,476. A move above the resistance at 43,476 will open the possibility of it jumping to the YTD high of 44,970.

Bitcoin price continued consolidating this week as the recent momentum faded. After peaking at near $45,000 on December 8, Bitcoin has remained at $41,000. The BTC/USD pair has dropped by more than 7% from its highest point this year rally loses steam

The BTC/USD pair remained in a tight range as in the past few days as some investors take profits and as concerns about the Fed continued. While the Fed delivered a dovish tone, there are concerns that the Fed could delay rate hikes.

This view was supported by several Fed officials who see no need to cut rates in the first quarter of 2024. Besides, inflation remains significantly above the Federal Reserve's target of 2.0% while the economy is doing well.

The most recent data showed that core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, remained at 4.0% in November. At the same time, the economy expanded by 5.2% in the third-quarter. The closely-watched Atlanta Fed GDP Now estimates that the economy will grow by 2.6% in Q4.

Additional data showed that the economy is doing well as the unemployment rate dropped to 3.2%. Retail sales, manufacturing, and services output have been relatively steady in the past few months. Therefore, cutting rates would risk fueling inflation.

The BTC/USD pair's consolidation has coincided with the recent rebound of the US dollar. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of currencies, has rebounded to $102.5, up from last week's low of 75/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin price went through a shakeout last week as it crashed from over $44,000 to a low of 40,120. A shakeout happens when an asset drops sharply for no main reason. It has now remained below the key support level at 42,000, which is below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

Bitcoin has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud. Also, the pair has retested the Woodie pivot point. Fortunately, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at 40,585 whose neckline is at 43,245, which is also along the first resistance of the Woodie pivot point .

Therefore, the outlook for Bitcoin is bullish as long as it is above the double-bottom pattern at 40,585. If this happens, the next price to watch will be at 43,245.

Bitcoin price bounced back after the encouraging Federal Reserve decision. The BTC/USD pair jumped to a high of 42,800, its highest point since Monday. It has jumped by more than 2,700 points from its lowest point this year sentiment

Bitcoin and other risk assets resumed the bullish trend as investors embraced risk-on sentiment. American equities bounced back, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 indices rising by almost 1%.

Meanwhile, the US dollar index fell by over 40 basis points while the closely-watched VIX index fell to its lowest point in over 4 years. The VIX is widely seen as the fear gauge in Wall Street.

In addition to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Solana also rose. The total market cap of all coins jumped to over $1.6 trillion.

In a statement, the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50% as most analysts were expecting. The dot plot showed that the bank would consider implementing three rate cuts in 2024.

This was a change of tune for a bank that has been hiking rates aggressively in a bid to fight inflation. It has hiked rates by about 550 basis points in the past two years.

Still, the bank has more work to do since inflation remains at an elevated level. Data published on Tuesday showed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped slightly from 3.2% in October to 3.1% in November.

Most importantly, the core inflation remained at 4.0%, double the Fed's target of 2.0%. In his statement, Powell noted that the bank was seeing progress in core inflation, which is a positive thing.

Bitcoin and other risky assets tend to do well when the Fed turns dovish. For example, it jumped to a record high in 2021 as the bank was cutting rates/USD technical analysis

Bitcoin dropped from last week's high of $45,000 to a low of $40,000 on Monday. It then bounced back after the dovish Federal Reserve decision. As it rose the pair crossed the 25-period and 50-period moving averages. It also formed a small double-bottom pattern at 40,495.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator pointed upwards. Therefore, the pair will likely continue rising as buyers target the key resistance point at 45,000, the highest point this year.

The Wednesday trading session witnessed Bitcoin experiencing a noticeable decline, settling just above the critical $40,000 level.

This movement is a reflection of the current market's sensitivity to various external factors, particularly the looming uncertainty around interest rates. The crypto community is eagerly awaiting more clarity on this front, with significant announcements expected within the next 24 hours. These updates are crucial as they directly impact investor sentiment and market dynamics.

The bond market, closely watched by investors, serves as a key indicator for the crypto markets. In environments where interest rates are high, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin tend to underperform. Therefore, the financial decisions made in major economies such as the United States, European Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are of paramount importance. They have the potential to cause significant fluctuations in the bond markets, which in turn can have a ripple effect on cryptocurrencies.

Despite the current uncertainty and volatility, the market is showing bullish tendencies. The $40,000 level is a significant psychological barrier for Bitcoin, attracting the attention of many investors. Even if the price dips below this mark, there is an expectation of strong support around the $37,500 level. Conversely, a surge above $42,000 could trigger a bullish rally, possibly leading the price towards $45,000 and then potentially to the $47,500 level. This latter figure is especially noteworthy, as it has historically been a pivotal point in longer-term price charts on the Dips

The prevailing sentiment in the Bitcoin market is inclined towards ""buying on the dips."" This strategy involves capitalizing on temporary price declines as potential entry points for investment. Currently, the appetite for shorting Bitcoin is low, at least until the currency breaks below the $35,000 mark. A drop beneath this level could potentially lead to further declines, although this scenario is generally considered unlikely at this juncture.

Ultimately, the Bitcoin market is currently navigating a complex web of global economic influences and investor psychology. The anticipation of decisions on interest rates, the influence of the bond market, and inherent market tendencies all play a role in shaping the current landscape. Investors are advised to remain vigilant, keeping a close eye on the evolving economic indicators and market signals. The ability to swiftly adapt to changing conditions is key in the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency trading. This environment demands a balanced approach, blending cautious risk assessment with the readiness to seize emerging opportunities.

Bitcoin , a well-known digital currency, experienced a slight upturn in its value during Monday's trading session.

It approached the $43,000 mark, a level known for its fluctuating and unpredictable nature, extending up to the $44,000 threshold. Surpassing this level could signal a further climb towards $47,500, a price point previously marked by significant resistance and selling activity.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get StartedSimple Technical Analysis

In simpler terms, if Bitcoin's value doesn't continue to rise and instead falls back, it might retest the 20-Day Exponential Moving Averag , possibly dropping to around $40,000. The $40,000 mark is not just a big, round number that catches people's attention; it's also a price point that has been crucial in the past. Generally, it looks like traders are keen on capitalizing on any short-term decreases in Bitcoin's price, indicating a strong belief in the currency's overall upward trend.

Bitcoin's market is typically full of ups and downs, and this is expected to continue, especially as the year draws to a close. During this period, market liquidity often decreases, which can lead to more volatility in Bitcoin's price. As we move through the last few weeks of the year, we might see considerable fluctuations in the market. This could be due to various factors, such as traders taking profits at year's end and ongoing questions about the practical use of Bitcoin in everyday transactions. Currently, Bitcoin is still mostly seen as a digital asset rather than a widely used currency for regular purchases.

Another factor influencing Bitcoin's market is the anticipation surrounding the potential introduction of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund. This type of fund would allow investors to trade Bitcoin more like stocks, and there's a lot of excitement about its possible launch. However, if this ETF doesn't come into play soon, Bitcoin's value could take a hit. It seems that much of the recent increase in Bitcoin's price might be due to investors trying to get ahead of this potential development. This market will continue to watch all the latest developments.

At the end of the day, Bitcoin's market remains dynamic and subject to various influences, from psychological price levels to market liquidity and potential new financial products. While it shows signs of bullish behavior, it's also important to be aware of the factors that could affect its value in both the short and long term.

This correction comes at a time when the bond market plays a significant role, with interest rates exerting a notable influence on risk appetite and Bitcoin's performance.

Bitcoin occupies a unique position on the risk appetite spectrum, making it particularly sensitive to changes in bond yields. If interest rates in the United States continue to decline, this could provide a favorable environment for Bitcoin's rally. Investors often turn to assets like Bitcoin when bond yields drop, as they seek higher returns.

Beneath the current levels, the $40,000 mark serves as a crucial support level. The presence of the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average indicator in this area adds to its significance. Many traders view pullbacks as opportunities to buy Bitcoin at a lower price, which may explain why this support level has held up. That being said, nothing is guaranteed to say the least.



In terms of market sentiment, there is a prevailing bullish outlook for Bitcoin .

However, the market is not immune to bouts of volatility, and traders should be prepared for occasional erratic price movements. As we approach the end of the year, market liquidity can dwindle, further contributing to potential price swings.

On the upside, the $45,000 level represents a notable resistance zone. Breaking above this level could open the path toward the $47,500 mark. It's worth noting that the $47,500 level has been a historical point of contention for sellers on weekly charts. Consequently, it's a resistance barrier that many market participants are likely to eye Certainly is Positive

In the end, Bitcoin's current correction is part of a broader market trend as it works off recent price exuberance. The interplay between Bitcoin and bond yields remains a key factor to watch. While potential resistance lies at the $45,000 and $47,500 levels, the $40,000 support level continues to provide stability. Overall, Bitcoin remains a favored asset among traders, but vigilance is required due to the potential for market volatility, particularly in the late-year period. Selling Bitcoin may not be a favorable option unless it breaks below the $35,000 level. Even then, we would have to take everything into context then.

On Monday, Bitcoin experienced a slight decrease in its trading value, testing the 20-day EMA indicator and the significant $40,000 level.

This $40,000 mark is not just a big round number but also a psychological barrier and a point where the currency has previously found support. It seems likely that buyers might step in to boost the market each time it dips towards this level. However, even if Bitcoin falls below $40,000, several other support levels could hold strong.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

These potential support areas include the $38,000 level, the 50-day EMA , and possibly the $35,000 mark. The $35,000 level is also a large, psychologically significant number and has historically been a strong support zone. It would only be if Bitcoin breaks below this level that concerns might arise about its long-term upward trend Rate Influence

It's important to note that Bitcoin's market will continue to be influenced by the trend of falling interest rates in the United States. With lower interest rates, there's more 'easy money' available, which could lead to a rally in the cryptocurrency market. As traditional investments like bonds yield less, investors might look for quicker or more volatile returns – and for many institutional investors, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the far end of the risk spectrum. This suggests that Bitcoin could remain a favorable option for those looking to buy on dips, even though we might see some sideways movement in the short term due to its recent significant rise.

If Bitcoin manages to break above the $45,000 level, the market could potentially surge towards the $47,500 mark. This level has been a major point of resistance in longer-term charts. Breaking past this barrier could turn it into a new target for the currency. In essence, the current market situation for Bitcoin seems to be one where finding value and capitalizing on it is key. Investors might view dips in its value as buying opportunities, anticipating further growth potential, especially in a market environment characterized by low interest rates and high-risk appetite.

Overall, the Bitcoin market is in a dynamic phase, influenced by broader economic factors and investor sentiment. Navigating this market requires a keen understanding of these influences, as well as a readiness to adapt to the rapid changes that characterize the cryptocurrency world.

The best method to identify a classic'price action reversal' is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar , a doji , an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching theprice actionthat occurs at the given levels/USD Analysis

I wrote in my previous BTC/USD analysis last Monday that Bitcoin might be a good long-term buy at support, but the drop from the highs printed several new resistance levels which may be hard to break. So, I saw the best approach might be to enter any bounces off support as long trades but be prepared to treat them like short-term trades if they do not perform well quickly.

This was a good call, as the price action has continued to be mostly bearish, but we do see strong support holding a bit lower than I was expecting last week, at $40,623. This level might still be a good place for a long-term buy as it is a little confluent with the big round number at $40k. However, the price chart below shows bearish price action bear the recent long-term highs, capped by a firmly descending trend line which seems to be pushing the price down.

I will still look for a firm bounce at $40,623 for a cautious long trade entry, but traders might want to be very cautious with this depending upon their risk appetite. More cautious traders may prefer waiting for a breakout signalled by a daily close above $44k which makes a new long-term high price.

On the other hand, due to its confluence with the bearish trend line, a short trade from a bearish reversal at $42,140 also looks attractive.

There is nothing of high importance scheduled today regarding the US Dollar.

LONDON , Dec. 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 'Build on Bitcoin' (BOB) , created by Interlay , marks a milestone in Bitcoin innovation with the launch of its public testnet development combines Bitcoin's strong security with the ability to execute Ethereum contracts in Rust and Solidity, ensuring decentralization and scalability are maintained.







Why BOB Matters

BOB stands apart from other ETH L2 solutions with its unique focus on Bitcoin, offering specialized tools and infrastructure designed specifically for BTC integration.

""BOB embodies a new vision of building on Bitcoin,"" said Alexei Zamyatin, Co-founder of BOB. ""We're embracing inclusivity over maximalism, enabling seamless interactions between the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems. Imagine: Bitcoin security paired with Ethereum's innovation powerhouse. We're setting the stage for a future where Bitcoin's full potential can be realized without compromising its core principles - as opposed to the status quo where 90% of Bitcoin use cases are centralized"".

What Sets BOB Apart

Three aspects mark BOB's unique positioning in the industry.

First, it integrates Bitcoin's secure protocol, utilizing its robust infrastructure to reinforce the security of decentralized applications on its layer 2 platform. In other words, the BOB infrastructure inherits security from Bitcoin.

Second, it features Ethereum roll-up compatibility, while maintaining support forBitcoin Rust libraries including Ordinals, Lightning, and the Nostr Asset Protocol.

Perhaps more importantly, through its connection to EVM, BOB is powered by Ethereum's innovation, using it to provide access to assets, liquidity, users and best-in-class infrastructure.



New Features of the Public Testnet

BOB's testnet is a showcase of its distinct features:



Bitcoin Security and Ethereum Innovation : Combines Bitcoin's robust security with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for smart contract creation, fostering innovative decentralized applications.



Rollup Layer with ZK Enhancements : Leverages the OP stack, enabling easy user and asset onboarding to Ethereum, augmented by upcoming zkVM improvements for added privacy and efficiency.



BTC Bridges and Unified Asset Management : Provides trustless Bitcoin data access and bridges for Bitcoin-Ethereum interactions, alongside unified management of BTC and EVM assets for a seamless user experience.



Comprehensive Developer Toolkit : Offers a robust SDK with Solidity contracts and tools for building on Bitcoin, including easy management of Bitcoin NFTs (Ordinals) and ERC20 token exchanges.



Innovative Off-Chain zkVM Technology : Integrates Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine for private, off-chain computation, enhancing transaction confidentiality while maintaining on-chain verifiability.

Account Abstraction simplifies fee payments, allowing users to seamlessly use Bitcoin for transaction costs as though it were the native currency of the network.

But we are attracted by a sequence of lower local highs, indicating an impressive selling proposition. We may be seeing profit taking from all the upside from the October lows. Working off this scenario suggests a pullback to the $38K area if the market falls below $40K. But even this potentially nasty drawdown looks to be just part of a larger bull cycle that Bitcoin is now moving within.

Ethereum is developing a retreat from the upper boundary of the trading channel, currently testing the early April peak area. The scenario of a shallow correction suggests a decline of about $100 more to $2060, but we should be ready for $1700 as well.

Morgan Creek Digital founder Anthony Pompliano believes that BTC continues to follow four-year market cycles fitting between halvings, and the next growth phase of the first cryptocurrency is now beginning.

The bitcoin-based NFT market will grow 100-fold in 2024, researchers at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget predict. The ORDI token, being the leading token of the Bitcoin ecosystem, is already capable of entering the top 30 in terms of market capitalisation during the next bull market. If the BTC ecosystem continues to expand, Bitcoin could reach $100K thanks to a surge in demand for the first cryptocurrency.

The US SEC is reviewing its approach to spot bitcoin ETFs following 'court decisions', the regulator's head, Gary Gensler, commented. The agency is currently reviewing between eight and 12 such proposals, he said.

The SEC rejected a petition by exchange Coinbase to develop rules for the cryptocurrency industry. According to Gary Gensler, existing laws apply to the industry, and there is nothing that would indicate the need for new regulations.

Asset management companies Galaxy Digital and DWS Group, as well as Dutch market maker Flow Traders, are creating a subsidiary firm, AllUnity, which will issue a euro-denominated stablecoin.

One more Solana-based meme token, also featuring a dog, Bonk (BONK), rose 100% overnight after listing on Coinbase. Its capitalisation has already passed the $1.7 billion mark.

This move positions the autonomous Chinese territory as a major market player. The regulator and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have updated its policy.



Now, it can regulate virtual asset activities, including crypto ETFs. This change marks a significant step in financial innovation.



Currently, Hong Kong offers futures price cryptocurrency ETFs . The regulator, however, is ready to expand.



It will consider applications for funds exposed to virtual assets, specifically spot asset ETFs.







Applicants must meet specific requirements to gain approval. They need to invest through Hong Kong's trading platforms. This ensures compliance and security.



Additionally, fund managers must transfer asset custody. They will use regulated virtual asset service providers or companies meeting the Monetary Authority's standards.



This adds another layer of security and trust. Hong Kong's shift reflects a broader trend. The market for cryptocurrencies is growing, and Hong Kong is joining in.



This comes as China continues to ban cryptocurrency investments. Meanwhile, there's global anticipation around the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Observers are eager to see if it will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs. Currently, like Hong Kong, the U.S. only permits futures ETFs.



In summary, Hong Kong is making significant strides in embracing Bitcoin ETFs.



This move diversifies its financial offerings and signals its position in the evolving global cryptocurrency landscape.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin had a little bit of a pullback during the week, but it looks as if the $40,000 level will continue to be important. It has held as nice support, and I think at this point in time there will be value hunters down in that region willing to pick up'cheap bitcoin.' That being said, I also recognize that we are heading into the end of the year and liquidity could be a serious problem. Because of this, you will have to be very cautious with your position sizing, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency.

The US dollar has plunged against the Canadian dollar as the Federal Reserve looks like it is ready to cut rates next year. This obviously has a lot of traders out there'front running' the idea of lower rates in America. That being said, it is probably only a matter of time before the Bank of Canada follow suit, as the 2 economies are so heavily intertwined. However, pay close attention to crude oil because it is starting to make signs of bullish pressure again, so that could also help this market breakdown below the crucial 1.33 level that offers support.





WTI Crude Oil

The West Texas Crude Oil market initially plunged during the course of the trading week, but has seen a lot of buying pressure sense, suggesting that perhaps we are getting close to reaching some type of bottom. If that ends up being the case, then I suspect we have a situation where traders will start to build longer-term positions. If that is going to be the case, you will have to be very cautious and deal with a lot of volatility, because not only is making a bottom very noisy, you also have a lack of liquidity heading into the end of the year. Underneath, the $65 level is still a major support level.

The US dollar fell during most of the trading week against the Swiss franc, but it looks like the 0.87 level is offering a bit of support. Because of this, we have to question whether or not we are in the midst of forming some type of massive'double bottom', which could keep the market supported. Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve looks likely to pivot for 2024, meaning that rates could go lower. However, that then brings up the question:'are we heading into a global recession?' If that's the case, the US dollar could pick up a bit of momentum.





Gold

Gold markets have been all over the place during the week, and quite frankly ended up closing on a rather sour note as it looks like we are going to continue to see plenty of pressure. The 2000 level underneath is support, but the fact that we gave up so much on Friday suggests that perhaps gold is going to struggle to go further from here. The Federal Reserve is pivoting and that should end up helping helped gold, but quite frankly I think the world is starting to sniff out some kind of major problem. Gold remains neutral between now and the end of the year with a slightly negative bias.

The EUR/USD shot higher during the course of the week to test the 1.10 level, but Friday was a horrible session. Because of this, I think we are trying to sort out whether or not the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to start pivoting is actually good news. Ultimately, looks like we are stuck between the 200-Week EMA at the 1.10 level, and the 50-Week EMA near the 1.0750 level again. What looks so promising at the beginning of the week suddenly doesn't look so thrilling.





DAX

The German DAX initially tried to rally during the week but ended up forming a nasty looking shooting star. Quite frankly, this is a market that has been overdone for some time, right along with many other stock indices globally. I also recognize that even though we are overbought, the real culprit might be the fact that it's the end of the year and traders will want to book gains. In order to do so, they will have to sell their position. If we break down below the lows of the week, we could see the DAX dropping down to the €16,500 level.

The British pound shot higher against the US dollar during the week as it's obvious that the Federal Reserve is going to start pivoting. However, looks like the 1.2750 level has offered enough resistance to keep the market down. At this point, it is very much like the euro, in the sense that we are just simply banging around between the 200-Week EMA and the 50-Week EMA indicators as we drift through the end of the year.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,8.276292,95286c36e98c9c4a7399e03c315a866c

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES, December 23, 2023 /EINPresswire / -- Nestled an hour northeast of Austin, Rockdale may appear to be the epitome of rural America with its rolling hills, green pastures, and the ubiquitous Walmart- a significant contributor to the city's sales tax revenue, a crucial aspect of its annual budget, according to Mayor John King.

However, for those attuned to the nuances, Rockdale is more than meets the eye; it's a haven for bitcoin miners. The town boasts crypto-friendly policymakers, expansive plots of land, abandoned industrial infrastructure awaiting repurposing, and seamless integration into Texas' power grid.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a non-profit entity overseeing the state's grid, operates in a deregulated environment, allowing consumers to choose their energy providers. This deregulation benefits miners at scale, engaging in an industry where energy is the primary variable cost. The competitive energy market in Texas often translates to lower rates, a boon for cryptocurrency miners.

Once home to Alcoa's massive aluminum plant, the world's largest at the time, Rockdale faced a shift when the plant began shuttering operations in 2008. With the influx of crypto miners, the ensuing idle energy capacity found a new purpose. Miners also offer flexibility amidst fluctuating power supplies and prices, unlike traditional businesses. This adaptability is crucial for a state like Texas, which has grappled with the reliability of its power grid, especially during extreme weather events.

Mayor King elucidates the mutually beneficial relationship between miners and ERCOT. Miners efficiently utilize otherwise wasted power and serve as ""interruptible load,"" capable of shutting down operations at a moment's notice to assist the grid during peak demand. Financial incentives drive this, as miners can sell surplus power back to the market at a substantial profit.

Senator Ted Cruz recognizes the potential of Bitcoin in addressing energy-related challenges, citing the cryptocurrency's ability to swiftly adjust power consumption during critical moments. Cruz emphasizes viewing Bitcoin as a means to fortify energy infrastructure rather than just a consumer of energy.

With 160 acres readily available, Rockdale has already received nearly 40 inquiries from mining companies, many of them Chinese miners seeking a new base after Beijing's crackdown on domestic crypto mining. James Gibson, the town's economic development director, notes that these miners come equipped with capital and equipment, requiring only a location with swift access to power.

The bank attributes this expected outperformance to an upcoming network upgrade for Ethereum, set to enhance its blockchain system's scalability and transaction speed.



While expressing optimism about Ethereum's future prospects, JP Morgan exercised caution regarding the broader cryptocurrency market in the coming year. The bank cited potential challenges, including the anticipated approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), concerns about speculative buying, and trading patterns influenced by speculation.



JP Morgan's analysts cautioned that the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs might not lead to substantial gains. They highlighted the likelihood of trading patterns characterized by buying during rumor spread periods and selling upon the occurrence of expected events. This behavior is expected to manifest once US regulators approve the launch of the funds, a decision expected early next year.



The report noted that the current weak demand for Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada serves as evidence that the introduction of this new investment tool in the United States may not garner significant momentum. As a result, these funds might withdraw capital from existing investment products tied to Bitcoin, potentially redirecting capital rather than attracting new investments.



JP Morgan's nuanced outlook reflects a mix of optimism and caution within the cryptocurrency landscape, with a focus on Ethereum's potential for success in the wake of network improvements. The cautious stance is driven by concerns surrounding market dynamics, regulatory decisions, and the impact of new investment tools on existing market structures.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_5.jpg,False,@menafn,7.3659225,003c25cf04929afac10f51a554887a60

Zn-BTC (H3BTC refers to 1, 3, 5-benzoic acid) MOF was used as a self-template and a zinc source to prepare ZnS/NiS
2
 with a layered heterogeneous structure as a promising electrode material using cation exchange and solid-phase vulcanization processes. The synergistic effect of the two metal sulfides enhances the application of ZnS/NiS
2
. And the high specific surface area and abundant active sites further promote the mass/charge transfer and redox reaction kinetics. In the three-electrode system, the specific capacitance was as high as 1547 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, along with satisfactory rate capability (1214 F/g at 6 A/g) and cycling performance. Coupled with activated carbon (AC), the prepared hybrid device (ZnS/NiS
2
 as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode) (ZnS/NiS
2
/AC) can be operated under a potential window of 1.6 V and provides a high energy density of 26.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 794 W/kg. Notably, the assembled ZnS/NiS
2
//AC showed little capacity degradation after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.


 










 


Hybrid supercapacitors, consisting of a capacitive electrode and battery electrode, are becoming a prominent alternative to chargeable battery and traditional carbon-based supercapacitors since they possess both high energy density and output power density. These inherent features make hybrid supercapacitors promising in the utilization of renewable energy. One major obstacle impeding the large-scale application of hybrid supercapacitors is the mismatch between a battery positive electrode and capacitive negative electrode in kinetics [
1
,
2
,
3
]. The current metal oxide battery electrodes face the bottleneck of low electronic conductivity and theoretical specific capacitance value, limiting the exploration of their further practical application [
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
]. Hence, there has been numerous research on non-oxide electrodes with excellent electronic conductivity and high capacitance, such as sulfides, nitrides and layered double hydroxides, etc., owing to their adjustable transition metal active sites and excellent mechanical and thermal stability [
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
].
Transition metal sulfides have become promising anode materials for supercapacitors by virtue of their good electronic conductivity, strong redox reversibility and low cost. Among them, ZnS, as a wide bandgap semiconductor material with the advantages of high electrical conductivity, strong stability and easy preparation, has been widely used in hybrid supercapacitor anode materials [
12
]. For example, as early as in 2006, Jayalakshmi et al. reported that ZnS nanoparticles synthesized via a solvothermal process using thiourea as a sulfur source were ideal to be utilized as electrodes in supercapacitors [
13
]. Through the hydrothermal technique and anion exchange reaction, Yi et al. synthesized ZnS nanoparticles manifesting a supreme reversible specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability and prominent ultralong cycle life [
14
]. Besides pristine ZnS, some composites containing ZnS, such as ZnS/graphene and ZnS/g-C
3
N
4
, were also reported to deliver reversible capacitance [
15
,
16
]. In spite of the great achievements of the ZnS-based electrodes with improved electrochemical performance, the capacitances of many previous reports are still far away from the practical requirements. Moreover, the same as other monometal sulfides, the limited number of electrochemically active sites, large volume expansion and low conductivity form vital challenges for exploring the full potential of ZnS as a supercapacitor electrode. Bimetal sulfides are expected to show better electrochemical properties than monometal sulfides.
Numerous efforts have been devoted to improve the electrochemical performance of the hybrid supercapacitor including optimizing the structure, composition and morphology of electrode material [
17
]. Among them, the construction of heterogeneous interfaces is considered to be an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. It can enhance the structural stability of the material while promoting charge transfer within the electrode material, thus further accelerating the reaction kinetics. The construction of heterogeneous structures can prevent the structural crushing of ZnS and provide additional conduction pathways. In addition, the presence of two or more components in a heterostructure yields multiple electrochemically active sites and synergistic interactions, which may boost the overall electrochemical performance of the electrode, including rate capability and cycling stability. Javed et al. have synthesized porous 2D ZnS/FeS composites, which offer a capacitance (1367.5 F/g at 3 A/g) with an outstanding operation life [
18
]. Saeed et al. developed hybrid electrode materials in which core-shell Zn-Ni
7
S
6
 nanosheet arrays were wrapped with Ni(OH)
2
 nanopetals (ZnS-Ni
7
S
6
/Ni(OH)
2
), quoting a commendable area capacitance outcome of 13.55 F/cm
2
 at 5 mA/cm
2
 and a long cycling life of 95.12% maintenance rate of capacitance over 10,000 cycles [
19
]. Arul et al. have reported that the ZnS/MnS heterostructures delivered a specific capacitance of 884 F/g at 2 mV/s, which was much higher than that of pristine MnS (423 F/g at 2 mV/s) [
20
]. ZnS/Ni
3
S
2
 electrode material obtained by the chemical co-precipitation of Ni
2+
 and Zn
2+
 followed by sulfurization was demonstrated to express high area-specific capacitance (890.1 C/g at 1 A/g), good rate capability (70% retention of its initial value from 1 A/g to 20 A/g) and good cycling stability (82% retention of initial value after 6000 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g) [

]. From the above examples, it can be concluded that constructing a heterostructure with other metal sulfides can enable ZnS to achieve better electrochemical performance. The reason for this, to a great extent, is because it relies on the coexistence of different metal cations, which provides multiple valence transitions, enabling multiple redox reactions and enriching structural deficiencies.
Based on the above discussion, in this paper, hierarchical ZnS/NiS
2
 heterostructures were formed via cation exchange and solid-phase sulfidation treatments using Zn-BTC (H3BTC refers to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) MOF as a self-template [

,
23
]. The micron-scale rod-like structure was transformed into a nanoscale porous flower-like structure during the cation exchange process, and solid-phase sulfidation was an effective way to construct multilayered composite metal sulfides by obtaining both metal sulfide heterojunctions and introducing a porous carbon skeleton. The formation of heterostructures has an obvious role in promoting charge/ion transfer as well as conductivity enhancement. The presence of mesopores and macropores gives the synthesized ZnS/NiS
2
 a high specific surface area of 74.88 m
2
/g, which is conducive to the provision of active sites and the reduction in mass/charge transfer resistance. When tested as supercapacitor electrodes, the ZnS/NiS
2
 heterostructures produced a high mass specific capacitance of 1547 F/g at 1 A/g with excellent retention and attractive cycling stability. To demonstrate their practical application, the researchers further constructed a hybrid supercapacitor device (ZnS/NiS
2
//AC) by using the generated ZnS/NiS
2
 as the positive electrode and commercial activated carbon (AC) deposited on nickel foam as the negative electrode. The assembled device can operate within a voltage window of 1.6 V and produces an excellent energy density of 26.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 794 W/kg, with satisfactory cycling stability and capacitance retention close to 100% after 5000 cycles. This study opens new horizons for investigating the potential of MOF-derived heterostructures in improving electrochemical performance and optimizing the microstructure of materials.

After cooling to room temperature, the resultant Zn/Ni-BTC powder was collected via centrifugation and washed several times with ethanol and deionized water before drying under a vacuum at 60 °C overnight.
The ZnS/NiS

Ethereum price rallied by over 85% in 2023 – a similar increase in 2024 places the target above $4,000.

Spot Bitcoin ETF approval will be a key catalyst for a price rally and also set a precedent for ETH ETF approvals in Q2 and Q3 2024.

Ethereum mainnet is expected to undergo the sharding upgrades, starting with Dencun, which will introduce proto-danksharding.

Investors and traders alike are anticipating ETH price to rise in order to book profits before Q2 2024.

Ethereum price increased considerably in 2023, recovering about a third of the crash from December 2021 to May 2022. However, the remaining two-thirds of this crash is expected to be recovered in 2024 owing to multiple factors.

ETH investors have a lot to look forward to throughout the year as events such as spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Dencun (sharding) update, and spot Ethereum ETF decision will be taking place, which are expected to be bullish catalysts. However, the lack of institutional investors' interest might act as a barrier to this growth and keep ETH from reaching $4,000.

2024 Fundamental outlook: Ethereum price to witness growth from spot Bitcoin ETF approval

2024 is expected to kick off the bull run that the crypto market has been waiting for since June 2022. Ethereum price, along with the rest of the market, is set to witness bullishness owing to one single factor – the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Over a dozen investment fund managers, including the likes of BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, have applied for ETFs. The initial outcome was not positive as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exhibited skepticism, but following Grayscale's win, sentiment changed.

The court ruled in favor of the asset manager in the lawsuit filed against the SEC for rejecting the request to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. This imbued confidence in the market, and the deadline for the final decision is expected to arrive by January 10, 2024.

Bitcoin spot ETF update

As Bitcoin price rallies, Ethereum will fulfill its role as the ""Silver to BTC's Gold"" and likely push other altcoins to rally as well.

Furthermore, this approval will also set a precedent for Ethereum spot ETFs, which asset managers are already eyeing. VanEck, ARK Invest, and BlackRock, among three others, have already applied for a spot ETH ETF. Grayscale, too, filed to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these applications have strong odds of approval, too, since they would be similar in design and structure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, their final deadline is between May and August 2024, giving investors time before they can get their hands on the investment products.

Ethereum spot ETF filings

That said, following the spot BTC ETF approval, ETH ETFs will see much less friction in acquiring a green light from the SEC. This will be the driving factor for the continuation of the Ethereum price rise in Q2 2024.

The Surge after the Merge

During a recent Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the future of the blockchain. Referencing the Merge, Buterin stated that the chain is only 55% complete and has a long way to go.

The next four stages, as noted by Buterin, will be The Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The first of these four – The Surge – will introduce sharding on Ethereum.

Sharding is a key scalability solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network's capacity to process transactions and execute smart contracts. This is done by splitting the network into smaller, more manageable chains called shards.

Ethereum Sharding structure

These shards are individual components of the Ethereum network itself. Each shard operates as an independent blockchain with its own set of smart contracts. These chains can process transactions and execute smart contracts independently, reducing congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.

The main goals of Ethereum developers with the sharding update are as follows:

Scalability: As the Ethereum network continues to grow, it faces significant limitations in transaction throughput and processing capacity. Sharding introduces a parallel processing approach, allowing multiple transactions and smart contracts to be processed simultaneously across different shards. Crosslinking: Shards communicate with each other through crosslinks, which are references to the state of one shard included in another shard's block. Crosslinking helps maintain consistency and integrity across the entire Ethereum network. Increased opportunities for validators: Validators participate in the consensus process by proposing and validating blocks on individual shards. Validators are chosen to propose blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they lock up as collateral in the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake system.

In the sharding update, the beacon chain will play a crucial role as well. The beacon chain was the first Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which acts as a separate blockchain that coordinates the overall network and manages the consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Stake). This chain will be used to coordinate communication between the shards.

The process of implementing sharding will begin with the Dencun upgrade. Set to be executed in Q1 2024, the upgrade will bring proto-danksharding to the network. Proto-danksharding will act as the scaffolding for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding, which is a crucial part of the Surge.

Dencun upgrade will also optimize the Ethereum gas fees, which has been a prevailing issue for users. Throughout 2023, Ethereum layer-2 chain's fee per transaction has averaged $0.02 to $0.21, whereas Ethereum mainnet transaction fees have averaged $4.86.

Ethereum and layer-2 chains' gas fees

As these updates are set to arrive in Q1 and Q2, with many of them expected to be deployed by May-June, they will likely act as the bullish catalyst of the second half of 2024.

2024 Technical Outlook: Ethereum price could see $4,000

Ethereum price over the past year had a good run, rising by more than 85%. While Q1 proved to be a good quarter for the altcoin, the growth halted, and ETH largely consolidated throughout Q2 and Q3, struggling to breach the $2,000 mark.

However, in Q4, Ethereum price began rallying again, mostly owing to expectations surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which also led to many investment funds filing for spot ETH ETFs. During this duration, ETH shot up by 51% to end the year at around $2,200, which is the present trading price.

Thus, if throughout 2023 ETH rose by over 85% despite the bearish market conditions, a similar rally or even a larger one can be expected out of a bullish year in which ETF approvals are expected, network developments are implemented, and Bitcoin halving will take place.

ETH/USD 1-week chart

If ETH repeats 2023's performance in 2024, the target for next year will be at over $4,000. The price indicators also suggest a bullish outcome despite the slight correction in the past few weeks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just exited overbought, coinciding with the pullback witnessed over the last week, whilst the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the zero line, showing the uptrend is accompanied by strong bullish momentum.

Although the receding green bars do suggest that the bullishness is waning at the moment, some pullback before bullish momentum regains strength is common in longer timeframes, and this can be observed during the past bull runs as well.

Furthermore, ETH has observed the 50, 100 and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) as support, which is a bullish indication since the last time this happened was in July 2020. At that time, ETH ended up scoring a 1,577% rally from $288 to $3,928, a feat that will not be replicated in 2024.

Nevertheless, despite the bullish indications, one should remember that the recent rally has caused the Ethereum price to be overbought on RSI, and investors might attempt to book profits in the first half of 2024 again. This falls in line with historical movement where ETH lived in the overbought zone (RSI above 70.0) for about six months before initiating short-term corrections in June 2021.

Ethereum RSI and MACD

The prospect of investors selling their holdings to realize profits is also evident from the on-chain metrics, which suggest investors may book profits if the Ethereum price shoots up. Nevertheless, ETH would still be expected to remain above the $2,500 mark until Q2, after the corrections, the ETF hype subsides, and the market moves on to the Ethereum network upgrades.

Profit-taking will bring corrections, but traders remain bullish

On-chain metrics can be used to analyze investors' behavior and make predictions about future price activity. One of the most important on-chain metrics is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric is an indicator used to assess the average profit/loss of investors who purchase an asset. It can provide clues as to when investors might begin taking profits and selling their holdings, leading to pullbacks in price.

The quarterly and yearly MVRV ratios are the most useful for long-term analysis. The 90-day MVRV ratio measures the average profit/loss of investors who purchased an asset in the past three months, and the 365-day MVRV ratio measures the same over the last year.

For Ethereum, the 90-day MVRV sits at 15.25%, which indicates that investors who purchased ETH in Q4 2023 are sitting at 15.25% profit. Similarly, the 365-day MVRV ratio is presently at 24.18%, suggesting that those who purchased throughout 2023 are, on average, witnessing 24.18% profits.

Interestingly, considering both the timeframes, it is evident that these investors are likely to be tempted to sell their holdings soon to realize profits. This could most certainly trigger a sell-off. As seen in the chart, when MVRV hits 9% to 34% on the yearly time frame and 7.8% to 31% on the quarterly time frame, ETH has undergone considerable corrections. Hence, this area is termed a danger zone.

Ethereum MVRV ratio

Apart from investors, the traders are also seemingly bullish. This inference is derived from the funding rates, which show an increasing trend. Such a trend suggests that long positions are gaining dominance, indicating a prevailing bullish market sentiment.

As can be observed on the chart below, the last time funding rates plunged into negative, i.e., short traders gained dominance, was back in March 2023. Since then, the rates have largely been positive, which means people are betting on a rise. This is solely being done with the intention of selling for profits.

Ethereum funding rate

So, considering these conditions, the bull run that starts due to spot Bitcoin ETF hype, followed by the sharding update, will likely urge investors to sell and realize profits. However, long-term holders will refrain and wait until the bull run flips and ETH begins witnessing a downtrend.

Watch out for institutions

One key factor that might act as a headwind to Ethereum price reaching the target of $4,000 is the lack of institutional interest ETH has been witnessing. Year to date, the crypto asset only managed to rake in $19 million, which is far lower than Solana's $146 million worth of inflows and astronomically less than Bitcoin's $1.7 billion.

Ethereum's year-to-date institutional flows

If this trend continues in 2024 as well, ETH might struggle to capitalize on the rest of the bullish cues since institutions are expected to drive the next bull run, and lack of interest from them may not play in Ethereum's favor.

Summary

To summarize the outlook for Ethereum in 2024, the best advice is to sit on holdings, wait and gain. A bullish year for the broader crypto market and a bullish year for ETH investors is the forecast. But that does not mean the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold is completely immune to bearish outcomes.

While an increase to $4,000 is possible, it is not a certainty since regulatory changes and unprecedented crashes plague the crypto market. Furthermore, considering the performance in 2023, ETH has not necessarily been the favorite asset of institutional investors. This lack of interest, if noted in 2024 as well, could act as an opposing force on ETH's potential growth.

Thus, it is advised always to do your own research and make the most ETH-ducated decision.",fxstreet.com,7502,news,ES,en,,https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Ethereum/ethereum_2_Large.jpg,False,@FXStreetUpdate,6.77007,7c373741ddfe309b4cca9a8f41b7fd73

ETF applications
 approaches, Bloomberg 
reports 
that the BTC options market is seeing increased hedging activity as traders prepare for a crucial decision on January 10th.


The report indicates a surge in open interest for put options expiring on Jan. 12, suggesting that market participants are taking steps to mitigate potential losses in the event of a
 negative verdict
 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding these index funds holding the cryptocurrency. 


Market Readies For Bitcoin ETF Verdict


The Bloomberg report highlights that the 
open interest
 for put options, which allow holders to sell Bitcoin, has seen a significant increase for contracts expiring on January 12. 


This surge in open interest has resulted in a higher put-to-call ratio for these specific options compared to contracts with expiration dates further out from the January 10 deadline. 
 
As seen in the chart below, the most prominent strike prices for the
 put contracts
 are $44,000, $42,000, and $40,000, respectively, indicating that put holders could exercise their options to minimize losses in case of a negative market reaction to the SEC decision.

Bloomberg


The put-to-call ratio, considered a measure of overall market sentiment, stands at 0.67 for the January 12 options contracts, indicating a more cautious approach among traders. 


Ryan Kim, head of derivatives at FalconX, suggests that leveraged/speculative traders are employing Bitcoin put options to protect their 
leveraged longs
, anticipating significant price movements in either direction. 


The higher put-call ratio for January 12 options further reflects the market's desire for protection against a potential negative decision.


The surge in open interest for put options expiring on January 12 indicates a growing need for protection in case of an unfavorable ruling. While Bitcoin's rally has softened the impact of its 2022 decline, market expectations for ETF approval may already be priced in, posing potential risks for the market. 


BTC's Price Resistance And Potential Dip 


Bitcoin has experienced a 
remarkable rally
 this year, with expectations for ETF approval driving its price up by more than 60% since mid-October. 


However, the Bloomberg report suggests that the surge in demand for the anticipated ETFs may already be factored into the token's price, potentially exposing the market to a 'sell the news' scenario in the second week of January. 
 
Furthermore, QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm, predicts topside resistance for Bitcoin in the range of $45,000 to $48,500 and a possible retracement to $36,000 levels before the uptrend resumes.

BTCUSDT on TradingView.com


Bitcoin is currently trading at $43,400, experiencing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Over the past 14 days, the cryptocurrency has shown a sideways price movement with a slight decrease of 0.4%. 


Given Bitcoin's well-known volatility, it remains uncertain how the market will react as the looming decision and potential catalysts draw near, and how these factors will impact its price dynamics.


However, the upcoming decision is not the sole catalyst that can potentially drive Bitcoin's price in 2024. The cryptocurrency is also anticipated to experience a significant catalyst in April 2024, known as the
 halving event
. 


This event has historically resulted in an upward surge in Bitcoin's price, and it is predicted to propel the cryptocurrency beyond its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,000 throughout the upcoming year.

MAP Protocol (MAPO) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 and peer-to-peer omnichain infrastructure that leverages light clients and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to enable cross-chain interoperability without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Introducing MAP Protocol: Bitcoin Layer-2 for Cross-Chain Interoperability

LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of MAP Protocol (MAPO), a cutting-edge solution in the blockchain space, designed as a layer-2 infrastructure for Bitcoin. Its primary aim is to enable cross-chain interoperability, a crucial aspect for the evolving blockchain ecosystem. By utilizing light clients and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof technology, MAP Protocol aims to stand out for its ability to facilitate seamless and efficient communication across EVM and non-EVM blockchain networks. This technology aims to ensure that while transactions are verified effectively, they do not compromise on privacy, a cornerstone of blockchain technology.

At its core, MAP Protocol is a peer-to-peer platform. It negates the need for centralized intermediaries. This approach aims to not only enhance security but also upholds the fundamental principles of blockchain technology - decentralization and user sovereignty. MAP Protocol thus represents a significant step forward in overcoming one of the key challenges in the blockchain domain: enabling diverse blockchain networks to interact and share information securely and efficiently.

In addition to its technical capabilities, MAP Protocol is also a development platform for decentralized applications (dApps). This feature significantly broadens the scope of blockchain applications, allowing developers to create dApps that are not limited to a single blockchain but can operate across multiple chains. Such flexibility is crucial in a landscape characterized by a multitude of blockchain networks, each with unique features and capabilities.

Finally, the evolutionary nature of MAP Protocol, driven by community involvement and continuous updates, mirrors the dynamic and collaborative spirit of the broader open-source software movement. This approach ensures that the protocol remains adaptable and responsive to the changing needs and challenges of the blockchain ecosystem. By fostering a community-driven development model, MAP Protocol embodies the participatory and democratic ethos that is at the heart of blockchain technology.

About MAPO Token

The MAPO token is an integral component of the MAP Protocol ecosystem, serving as the native utility token for facilitating various operations and transactions within the platform. It is important to note that both MAPO and MAP are MAP Protocol's native token, and the use different ticker symbol is to differentiate the chains they are on. MAPO is on MAP Relay Chain thus the MAP Protocol mainnet, while MAP is on other chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon.

MAPO plays a critical role in the governance, maintenance, and development of the MAP Protocol infrastructure. Holders of MAPO can participate in network governance, stake tokens to secure the network, and earn rewards for their contributions, such as running nodes or maintaining the system's integrity. The distribution and allocation of MAPO are strategically planned to align with the long-term growth and sustainability of the MAP Protocol.

Based on MAP Protocol, MAPO has a total supply of 10 billion (i.e. 10,000,000,000), with 133,886,020, thus 5.9% of the circulating supply, set to be burned at 1PM UTC time on December 18. The distribution of MAPO tokens is allocated as follows: 15% for developers, 21% for Ecosystem DAO, 12% for MAP Foundation, 22% for investors and early supporters, and 30% as mining rewards for validators.

Bearish view



Sell the BTC/USD pair and set a take-profit at 40,160.

Buy the BTC/USD pair and set a take-profit at 44,200. Add a stop-loss at 40,000.

Bullish view

The BTC/USD pair retreated as the recent bull run lost momentum. Bitcoin pulled back to $42,000, which was a few points below the year-to-date high of near $45,000. Despite the pullback, it has still risen by more than 150% in 2023, outperforming key assets like the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq 100 index volumes and next catalyst

Bitcoin price pulled back in a relatively low-volume environment as the holiday season continued. Data compiled by CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap shows that most brokers had lower volume in the past few days.

Bitcoin also diverged from American equities as the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 rose. Also, US bond yields continued falling, signaling that traders are optimistic that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in the coming months.

The Fed Rate Monitor tool shows that most economists believe that the first rate cut will happen in March. It also expects at least three more hikes in 2024 if inflation continues falling. Some analysts, including Cathie Wood, believe that the US could move into deflation.

Deflation is characterized by a reduction in product and service prices. While this is a good thing, it also sends the wrong signal about the economy. For example, consumers, who make up the biggest part of the economy could hold back spending hoping that prices will continue falling.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies thrive in a period of low inflation and a dovish tone. For example, it surged to its highest level on record in 2021 as the Fed slashed interest rates and ramped up its QE program.

Bitcoin has also retreated as traders take a breather following a highly successful year. It started the year below $20,000 as concerns about the FTX collapse intensified. It then rallied as hopes of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval continued/USD technical analysis

The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has moved sideways in the past few days. While it remains above the 50-day moving average , it has also formed a double-top pattern. In most cases, this pattern is usually one of the most bearish signs in the market. Its neckline stands at $40,162.

Therefore, the outlook for the BTC/USD pair is bearish, with the initial support level to watch being at 40,162. This view will become invalid if the price reverses and moves above the year-to-date high of 44,987.

Bitcoin exhibited a notable surge during Thursday's trading session, signaling a potential breakout to higher levels. In the current landscape, it is imperative to closely monitor the $45,000 level, as it holds considerable significance.

This level garners substantial interest due to its round and psychologically important nature. It has also served as a point of resistance in recent weeks. If the market manages to breach this threshold, it could potentially initiate a significant upward rally, possibly targeting the $47,500 level, an area where significant selling pressure has been observed before.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started

In the event of any pullbacks in the market, they should be regarded as favorable buying opportunities. The market demonstrates evident bullish sentiment, and there are notable support levels to consider. The 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) provided support earlier in the week, and there's also the $40,000 level beneath it, which could offer substantial support. Generally, this market seems to possess a robust support base, and as interest rates continue to decline, it becomes increasingly logical for institutional investors to seize opportunities in the form of ""cheap coins.""No shorting

It's crucial to emphasize that I have no inclination to short this market. While liquidity may pose some challenges over the next few trading sessions, the long-term trend appears solidly entrenched in favor of Bitcoin.

This market has frequently demonstrated a negative correlation with traditional industries. As these conventional sectors continue to experience declines in the United States, institutional investors are increasingly willing to venture into higher-risk assets, with cryptocurrencies being notably positioned on the risk spectrum. Investing in the crypto market inherently involves embracing substantial risk, and the decline in interest rates further incentivizes investors to explore this arena. Consequently, I anticipate that we will witness sustained upward momentum over the long term.

In conclusion, any contemplation of shorting this market would require a substantial breakdown below the 50-Day EMA, a scenario that currently appears remote given the prevailing market dynamics and sentiment. At this point in time, I believe that the market is going to be very positive for the year 2024, and maybe even further as the Federal Reserve continues to loosen monetary policy. That being said, there is a real possibility that we eventually have some kind of'risk off event', which could be negative for the BITC markets.

Bitcoin exhibited a slight pullback on Friday, setting the stage for a tranquil drift into the holiday season.

In this context, it seems evident that we will witness a consistent influx of buyers seeking to capitalize on the cryptocurrency's intrinsic value.

Such a trend has been the hallmark of the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin leading the way. The 20-Day Exponential Moving Average emerges as a crucial support level, acting as a formidable short-term foundation should we revisit this moving average.

Beneath this support lies the $40,000 threshold, coupled with an influential trendline that comes into play. It's important to recognize the Bitcoin market's heightened sensitivity to interest rates, which profoundly impacts the decisions of institutional traders. These traders are perpetually on the lookout for higher yields, especially when the traditional haven of ""risk-free rate"" in US Treasury markets is not as strong as it once was, and will more likely than not only get worse the Dips

Under these circumstances, the prevailing strategy remains to ""buying on the dips."" Should Bitcoin manage to surge past the $45,000 mark, it may propel a concerted ascent toward the $47,500 level. This price point serves as a formidable resistance barrier, a site of previous significant selling activity. Consequently, it logically emerges as a prominent target for Bitcoin enthusiasts. If the $47,500 threshold is breached, it could pave the way for an ambitious advance toward the coveted $50,000 milestone, which is bound to command substantial attention.

Conversely, if the market experiences a downturn, slipping below the $40,000 level, a more profound correction will probably ensue. Investors may start contemplating the 50-day EMA as a potential support level . In the grander scheme of things, Bitcoin's landscape appears punctuated by periodic turbulence. However, all things considered, the broader outlook remains distinctly bullish over the long term. It's essential to recognize that the forthcoming couple of trading sessions might be characterized by reduced activity due to the holiday season.

In the end, Bitcoin's current trajectory suggests a continuation of the ""buy on the dips"" strategy. While potential resistance levels loom on the horizon, the cryptocurrency market's resilience remains impressive. As the holiday season unfolds, it's wise to anticipate some market idiosyncrasies, but the overarching sentiment continues to favor a bullish outlook in the extended timeline.

BTC/USD as of this writing is near the 43,625.00 level as of this writing. Clearly the price of Bitcoin should be checked on as you read this article to gauge the movement of the digital asset. The gains BTC/USD has made since October when a value around 26,500.00 was seen are clearly remarkable. Short and mid-term traders may be feeling extremely bullish about BTC/USD based on technical one, three and six month charts.

It must be said that even a one year chart of BTC/USD looks encouraging at this juncture. But here's the problem, experienced traders of BTC/USD know that the digital asset remains highly volatile – like gasoline. Speculators who have been trading Bitcoin for a long time also know and likely have experienced the pain of price declines, and it should be noted reversals lower in BTC/USD still occur regularly Zealous Buying in BTC/USD Could Prove Dangerous

It is no fun to stand in front of an oncoming train. The trend upwards in BTC/USD has been strong and it is hard to argue against. The digital asset clearly has a rather large amount of momentum via continued loud whispers in the financial world that 'ETFs' will be approved by the U.S government which will allow a wide variety of investors to gamble on Bitcoin. And I use the word gamble intentionally. BTC/USD remains a highly questionable speculative asset.



Volumes in BTC/USD trading have increased in the past few months, as speculators have begun to feel 'comfortable' with Bitcoin once again. However, the approaching holidays will likely cause thin volumes to be seen and potentially open the doors for additional fast trading in BTC/USD.

Yes, BTC/USD has gone from nearly 39,000.00 to its current price around 43,625.00 in December, but day traders who are using leverage need to understand that small moves can cause massive losses quickly. There is no doubt the current price momentum higher when technical charts are viewed show a strong trend higher, but the history of Bitcoin is littered with major crashes lower and speculators need to use this knowledge as they use risk taking tactics carefully Trading Volumes and the Coming Holiday Season

It is hard to argue against the climb that has been seen in Bitcoin, but if you are going to be a buyer of BTC/USD you still need to use solid risk management. Using take-profit orders to cash out of winning positions before they vanish is recommended. Lastly, trading BTC/USD remains dangerous and its history of reversing wildly lower remains a constant source of concern Short-Term Outlook:

Bitcoin faced a notable decline in its trading session on Tuesday, with prices reaching the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average indicator.

This indicator has garnered substantial attention amid Bitcoin's remarkable uptrend. Importantly, it remains comfortably above the critical $40,000 threshold, a significant psychological level that naturally garners considerable market focus.

The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is significantly influenced by interest rates, with a pronounced negative correlation. Bitcoin, being a speculative asset, tends to thrive when the cost of capital is relatively low, attracting larger institutional players into the mix. Speaking of institutional involvement, it is worth noting that the period between now and New Year's Day is likely to see limited institutional participation, as institutions typically shy away from thin and illiquid markets. Paradoxically, this limited institutional presence could lead to heightened volatility, potentially propelling Bitcoin's movements higher if someone big does jump in the Dip Continues

A closer look at the Bitcoin chart reveals a consistent pattern of buyers stepping in whenever the price experiences a modest retracement, a trend that has persisted over the past several months. Presently, the market appears to be engaged in consolidation, attempting to accumulate value incrementally. However, it is crucial to assess the current situation within the context of formidable resistance levels, particularly around the $44,250 mark. A breakthrough above this resistance could pave the way for a test of $45,000 and possibly even a push toward the coveted $50,000 level.

In summary, the current landscape presents a scenario where numerous investors are eager to participate in a market that has remained bullish for an extended period. Nonetheless, it is essential to exercise prudence and avoid making large-scale investments hastily. Instead, consider each dip as a potential opportunity to acquire additional Bitcoin incrementally. Shorting Bitcoin does not appear to be a viable strategy soon, unless the price decisively breaches the 50-day EMA , situated closer to the $38,000 level.

As Bitcoin continues to reach higher, this is a situation where there are plenty of people out there willing to get involved, as the overall bullish run on crypto continues to be a big deal and should continue to gain based on interest rates dropping in the US, and other central banks around the world. With this, I remain bullish but recognize that we are in the middle of the holiday season.

Crypto market capitalisation was climbing to $1.67 trillion on Friday morning – a new high since May 2022. However, very quickly, the market was hit by another wave of profit-taking, which has become commonplace over the past fortnight.

Bitcoin is once again pulling back down after touching the $44 level, having retreated to $43 by the start of active trading in Europe. Horizontal resistance has been effectively holding back the bulls for the past three weeks. On the other hand, the price dips are getting shallower, keeping the longer-term bullish trend in place.

Solana lost over 6% in a couple of hours, correcting after a failed assault on the $100 mark. But even with the pullback to $94, this altcoin is adding 8% in 24 hours and over 70% in 30 days. Its capitalisation is now only 8% below BNB, which is ranked #4 on CoinMarketCap.

The temporary nature of the BTC and SOL pullback is indirectly indicated by the positive dynamics of ETH, whose growth has accelerated in the last few hours and brought the price to $2300.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,8.259182,0ce55a9f32b5951a01a58f7b3fe978a8

This surge included an 11.30% rise in December, highlighting the cryptocurrency's robust growth throughout the year.



Following closely, Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs , representing shares of international companies in Brazil, recorded the second-best performance.



They saw a 26.33% growth over the year, including a positive change of 2.84% in December.



Government bonds, specifically Tesouro IPCA with a 2035 maturity and Tesouro Selic 2025, also showed noteworthy gains.



They rose by 19.80% and 13.16%, respectively, surpassing the preliminary inflation rate of 4.72%, measured by the IPCA-15.







Gold, another asset beating the preliminary inflation rate, grew by 13.67% over the year and increased by 0.90% in December.



However, the Index of Investment Funds experienced mixed fortunes, growing 15.50% in 2023 but facing a sharp decline in December.



Contrarily, the U.S. dollar saw the least favorable performance among investors in 2023, falling by 8.06%. It ended the year valued at R$ 4.85, indicating a notable depreciation.



The Ibovespa, the main index of the B3 São Paulo Stock Exchange, also showed strong performance.



It closed at 134,185.24 points, up by 22.28% from the end of 2022. Its peak was on December 27th, reaching an all-time high of 134,193.72 points.



Brazil's economic confidence improved significantly as indicated by the country's risk measured through the 5-year Credit Default Swap (CDS).



It dropped to 132 points, a decrease of 117.86% for the year, reflecting increased confidence in Brazil's economic prospects.

This ledger system, upon which Bitcoin is built, ensures every transaction is transparent and immutable, secured by the collective verification of its users. Smart contracts, the very essence of blockchain's promise, automate agreements without the need for intermediaries, ensuring'code is law'.







Amidst this backdrop, Bitcoin ETFs emerged, proposing a traditional financial instrument that mirrors Bitcoin's market value, offering investors a familiar path to enter the cryptocurrency space. While products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust have provided similar exposure, their structure differs from the ETFs that many investors hope for – a difference that lies in liquidity, price, and the underlying assets.

Trust Bitcoin represents the convergence of blockchain's transformative potential with the world of finance. It's a beacon of innovation, projecting the security and reliability of Bitcoin into a comprehensive investment framework. Trust Bitcoin's initiative is to encapsulate the trust less and transparent nature of blockchain through a decentralized exchange-traded fund, ensuring that the integrity of investments is as immutable as the ledger it's recorded on. This project isn't just a step forward in blockchain technology; it's a leap towards a future where financial systems are open, accessible, and equitable. The DETF by Trust Bitcoin stands as the vanguard of this movement, extending an invitation to all to partake in the financial evolution.







The DETF model of Trust Bitcoin is a significant innovation in the world of finance, particularly in the domain of cryptocurrency investments. By harnessing the power of blockchain, Trust Bitcoin's DETF offers unprecedented security, ensuring that investments are protected by the most robust cryptographic techniques. Transparency is another cornerstone of this model, where every transaction and fund movement is recorded on a blockchain, visible and verifiable by all, ensuring a level of openness that traditional funds can't match. Moreover, the reduced operational costs inherent to blockchain technology translate to lower fees for investors, making it a more attractive option. This democratization of investment opportunities allows even small-scale investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market, previously dominated by larger players. Trust Bitcoin's DETF thus represents a significant step towards an inclusive financial ecosystem, underpinned by the stability and credibility of Bitcoin.





In conclusion, Trust Bitcoin is not just another cryptocurrency project; it is a testament to the evolving nature of investment in the digital age. Through DETF, Trust Bitcoin is setting the stage for a future where investing in digital assets is as straightforward and regulated as investing in the stock market, yet with the added benefits that blockchain technology brings to the table. The Trust Bitcoin Protocol embodies a forward-thinking approach to finance, one that could redefine the essence of investment for generations to come.

The site's financial analyst, Alice Leetham, comments:

Bitcoin's current rank is a true reflection of decentralized technologies taking over our financial systems. Looking back, Bitcoin has seen unprecedented growth over the years, and overcome so many setbacks. With continual acceptance of crypto and the rising momentum on blockchain tech, we can expect Bitcoin to rise as one of the most valued currencies in the world.

The Bitcoin market in 2023 comes as a recovery, considering it lost about 65% in market value in 2022. Naturally, like all major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was hit hard by the fall of FTX, the recessive economy, and the regulatory crackdown. As a result, its market value and price fell. However, 2023 represents a good year for the Bitcoin market, with prices currently at $ 43,036.

Stocks found themselves trying to battle back from early pressure that pushed them into the red shortly after the opening bell on Friday. But it appears that bulls spent their reserves in the run-up earlier in the week, leading to a negative close for the major indices.
As 2023 trading officially came to an end, the S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq were down 0.28%, 0.05%, and 0.56%, respectively.
Data provided by TradingView shows that Bitcoin bulls were battling bears from the open of the daily candle, with the top crypto hitting a daily high of $43,140 near midday before reversing course to hit a low of $41,650 just three hours later. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $42,200, a decrease of 1% on the 24-hour chart.
BTC/USD Chart by TradingView
'On these very last days of 2023, Bitcoin is at a crossroads around $43k. It has zoomed 160% over the year, but is still 14% below where it was at the end of 2021,' said David Lifchitz, chief information officer at Tellurian-ExoAlpha, in a note shared with Kitco Crypto.
'Until mid-October 2023, Bitcoin has had just 2 positive impulses: one mid-January and one mid-March,' Lifchitz said. 'Between mid-March and mid-October, Bitcoin was essentially sideways in a $4,000 range (between $24k and $28k). It was only by mid-October 2023 that Bitcoin began its tremendous growth from $28k to $43k (about 50% in just 2 months) as the first Bitcoin ETF was becoming more probable with industry giants such as Blackrock and Fidelity getting involved.'
'Also, at the same time, clarification and asset recovery about last year's FTX bankruptcy has been a positive catalyst for the digital assets over that period,' he said.
'The expected approval of a Bitcoin ETF by January 10th, 2024 according to the latest notice from the US SEC (notice about its decision deadline, not about the outcome) is the big event that everybody is waiting for,' Lifchitz noted. 'Such an instrument will give seamless access to the digital asset to investors from their regular trading accounts but also allow them to store it in their IRAs, instead of having to deal with cumbersome digital assets exchanges and storage accounts (wallets). Institutional investors will be able to access Bitcoin in the form of a regulated liquid instrument.'
Making the straightforward case for a rise in BTC price, Lifchitz said, 'The logic is then that even if a small percentage of US investors add 0.5% of BTC into their global portfolio now that they will have an easy tool for doing so, this will lead to a massive inflow of money into the digital asset compared to its currently existing market cap, leading thus it to a significant price increase.'
'But this is for the mid-to-long term as most investors won't flock day one into that new ETF,' he said. 'Moreover, if Bitcoin were to correct hard, investors won't rush into it immediately.'
'This leads to the classic ‘buy the rumor/sell the news' event where Bitcoin has already been pumped up proactively from mid-October to mid-December on the ‘rumor' and could correct shortly after approval of the Bitcoin ETF news breaks,' he warned. 'However, a last pump could take place in the very early days of 2024 from $43k at the time of writing to $45k-$47k on New Year fund inflows. A ‘sell the news' event could take it back down to $38k-$40k afterward.'
Lifchitz also noted an interesting parallel that has arisen since the launch of the first Gold ETF (GLD).
'Before that, investors could only access gold either through derivatives (futures contracts which are essentially reserved for professional traders) or to physically buy and store gold,' he said. 'Leading up to the Gold ETF inception, the same logic of easy access to the commodity by a large swath of ‘buy and hold' investors led to a significant price increase of the commodity… but its price actually felt in the following months: investors took time to get into it and as its price was declining, they had no rush to get in.'
While many analysts have suggested that Bitcoin could behave similarly, Lifchitz noted that the top crypto has another approaching development in its favor: the halving.
'2024 is a ‘halving year' for Bitcoin, which has always been bullish up to the halving event – scheduled next April – so a post-ETF dip may be quickly bought leading up to the halving,' he said. 'But this is just one scenario and history has shown, especially with Bitcoin, that anything can happen… so I will refrain from making the usual ‘1 year ahead price projection,' and just highlight some possible price action scenarios in the short term.'
The likelihood of a spot BTC ETF approval in early January just got a little stronger, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that on Friday, Blackrock released its updated S-1 form naming the authorized participants for its application as Jane Street and JPMorgan.
'Looks like we have our first horse at the starting gate,' Balchunas tweeted.

(Reuters) - Asset management firms hoping to be among the first to win regulatory approval to launch exchange traded funds (ETFs) tied to the spot price of bitcoin updated their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday and Friday, as market participants said a decision from the regulator may be imminent.
By late Friday afternoon, BlackRock Asset Management, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments, Bitwise Investment Advisers, Invesco Ltd., Fidelity, WisdomTree Investments and a joint venture between Ark Investments and 21Shares had all submitted new documents with regulators spelling out details of the arrangements each has made with their marketmakers to ensure trading is liquid and efficient.
People familiar with the filing process said issuers that met their end of the year filing revision deadlines may be able to launch by January 10 - the date by which the SEC is required to either approve or reject the Ark/21Shares ETF.
The SEC may notify issuers as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday that they have been cleared to launch the following week, said those sources, who spoke on background given the confidential nature of the discussions.
Bitcoin's price has more than doubled this year to just under $42,000, fueled in part by expectations that the SEC will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF.
If regulators opt to approve the spot bitcoin ETFs, they could then inform issuers as early as next week.
Valkyrie also disclosed in its filing that it would levy a management fee of 0.80% on the ETF, should the SEC approve the products early in the new year. Ark and 21Shares had previously disclosed they proposed to charge the same fee on their own ETF.
The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is poised to be the least expensive, levying fees of only 0.39%.
Invesco announced plans for a 0.59% fee, but added in its filing that it would waive that fee for six months on the first $5 billion in assets the new fund attracts.
There are currently a total of 14 asset managers hoping to finally win SEC approval for spot bitcoin ETFs. Over the last decade, the U.S. securities regulator has rejected multiple attempts to launch these products, citing fears about market manipulation and an inability on the part of would-be issuers to protect investors. To date, the only cryptocurrency ETFs approved have been tied to futures contracts on bitcoin and ethereum, which are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Grayscale Investments and Hashdex, both of which hope to convert existing products into spot bitcoin ETFs, submitted their own updates earlier this month.
The SEC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

UXUY
, the next-generation decentralized multi-chain trading platform incubated by Binance Labs, announced the launch of the world's first standardized indexer for the multi-chain inscription market—UXUY Indexer. This is the most important iteration of UXUY in the Bitcoin ecosystem after the Struck by Lightning plan. 
It means that UXUY officially serves the inscription track as a builder, providing standardized indexing services for Bitcoin Ordinals, BRC20 and the entire inscription market.
 
UXUY believes that inscriptions, as a new narrative in the crypto field, are becoming the third largest crypto asset type after Token and NFT. More value and innovation will be created here, and it will completely rewrite the way assets are created in the crypto industry.
 
UXUY Indexer will adhere to the principle of decentralization, fully embrace Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi, and build a solid infrastructure for the long-term prosperity and development of the inscription market.
 
UXUY is willing to participate with more builders to promote inscriptions to become a phenomenon-level consensus in the encryption industry.
 
As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in 2009:
 
 
'It might make sense to get some in case it becomes popular. If enough people think the same way, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.' (January 2009) — Satoshi Nakamoto
 
 
Inscription and Crypto Equality
 
At the beginning of its establishment, UXUY officially issued 
Crypto Equity Manifesto
, proposing that 
trading is the only weapon that can break down barriers
, advocating that various ecosystems should break down barriers, conduct cross-chain transactions, build a crypto ecosystem without walls, and jointly promote crypto equality, which coincides with the spirit of the inscription being highly consistent.
 
As a fairer way to create assets, inscriptions establish a complete trading market between various ecologies and explore new opportunities for innovation.
 
2023 is the first year for the cryptocurrency inscription market. The Ordinals protocol has completely ignited the inscription market. Currently, more than 50 million inscriptions have been inscribed on the Bitcoin network, and the cumulative inscription casting fee is as high as 5039 BTC, which is approximately US$215 million.
 
At present, the development of the inscription track is still in its early stages. The inscription specifications among various ecology are not the same, and there is no real-time trading of inscriptions. On the Ethereum ecosystem, more than two million inscriptions have been minted, but most of them are in a state of dissociation, with no transactions or transfers occurring.
 
The of the inscription has just begun...
 
UXUY believes that the discovery of value must be based on transactions, and this is especially true for the inscription market. UXUY will actively improve the infrastructure of the inscription market to safeguard cryptographic fairness among various ecosystems. UXUY adheres to the principle of cryptographic equality, serves the inscription market, provides infrastructure for the construction of the inscription market, actively maintains the on-chain storage and off-chain computing functions of the indexer, and creates a more friendly off-chain environment for inscription transactions.
 
In this regard, 
UXUY proposed that the Inscription market should abide by the idea of DMT (Deploy, Mint, Transfer), and Inscription should not rely on any project party to complete transaction transfers.
 
UXUY will establish the first inscription infrastructure that embraces Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi. Based on serving the entire inscription market, it will open up the inscription transaction barriers of various public chains and Layer 2, connect every corner of the crypto continent, and promote the consensus of crypto equality. Illuminating more emerging assets.
 
Why we need an indexer
 
The indexer is an important part of the Inscription world. It is used to track the wallets, quantities and other information of the Inscription tokens held to ensure that the Inscription market of cryptocurrency operates effectively.
 
The inscription data is only stored on the chain and is an original certificate. The update and check of the data rely on the indexer to solve the problems of indexing, retrieval, and settlement of the inscription ecological data.
 
At the same time, the indexer reads all inscription transaction information, checks which inscription is ""deployed"" first, and maintains the ""First is First"" criterion. By tracking which wallets deployed the original token supply, what the maximum limit was, when minting was terminated, and the traceability of those token wallets in the secondary market's 'Transfer'.
 
Without indexers, inscriptions would be limited to indistinguishable Josn text files, and the market for inscriptions would cease to exist.
 
Embracing the spirit of Satoshi
 
UXUY actively embraces Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi, and is based on conducting inscription transactions and transfers through native protocols without relying on any project parties. UXUY calls on the market to adhere to the Declaration of Crypto Equality, abide by DMT ideas, and actively embrace the inscription infrastructure of Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi.
 
Bitcoin has revolutionized the world through a trustless system for financial transactions without intermediaries, and Inscription creates a fairer and more decentralized way of asset development, and the entire encryption industry will enter a ""trustless"" era.

Singapore, Dec. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On December 28, 2023, UXUY , the next-generation decentralized multi-chain trading platform incubated by Binance Labs, announced the launch of the world's first standardized indexer for the multi-chain inscription market-UXUY Indexer. This is the most important iteration of UXUY in the Bitcoin ecosystem after the Struck by Lightning plan. It means that UXUY officially serves the inscription track as a builder, providing standardized indexing services for Bitcoin Ordinals, BRC20 and the entire inscription market.



UXUY believes that inscriptions, as a new narrative in the crypto field, are becoming the third largest crypto asset type after Token and NFT. More value and innovation will be created here, and it will completely rewrite the way assets are created in the crypto industry.



UXUY Indexer will adhere to the principle of decentralization, fully embrace Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi, and build a solid infrastructure for the long-term prosperity and development of the inscription market.

UXUY is willing to participate with more builders to promote inscriptions to become a phenomenon-level consensus in the encryption industry.

As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in 2009:

Inscription and Crypto Equality

At the beginning of its establishment, UXUY officially issued Crypto Equity Manifesto , proposing that trading is the only weapon that can break down barriers , advocating that various ecosystems should break down barriers, conduct cross-chain transactions, build a crypto ecosystem without walls, and jointly promote crypto equality, which coincides with the spirit of the inscription being highly consistent.

As a fairer way to create assets, inscriptions establish a complete trading market between various ecologies and explore new opportunities for innovation.

2023 is the first year for the cryptocurrency inscription market. The Ordinals protocol has completely ignited the inscription market. Currently, more than 50 million inscriptions have been inscribed on the Bitcoin network, and the cumulative inscription casting fee is as high as 5039 BTC, which is approximately US$215 million.

At present, the development of the inscription track is still in its early stages. The inscription specifications among various ecology are not the same, and there is no real-time trading of inscriptions. On the Ethereum ecosystem, more than two million inscriptions have been minted, but most of them are in a state of dissociation, with no transactions or transfers occurring.

The of the inscription has just begun...

UXUY believes that the discovery of value must be based on transactions, and this is especially true for the inscription market. UXUY will actively improve the infrastructure of the inscription market to safeguard cryptographic fairness among various ecosystems. UXUY adheres to the principle of cryptographic equality, serves the inscription market, provides infrastructure for the construction of the inscription market, actively maintains the on-chain storage and off-chain computing functions of the indexer, and creates a more friendly off-chain environment for inscription transactions.

In this regard, UXUY proposed that the Inscription market should abide by the idea of DMT (Deploy, Mint, Transfer), and Inscription should not rely on any project party to complete transaction transfers.

UXUY will establish the first inscription infrastructure that embraces Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi. Based on serving the entire inscription market, it will open up the inscription transaction barriers of various public chains and Layer 2, connect every corner of the crypto continent, and promote the consensus of crypto equality. Illuminating more emerging assets.

Why we need an indexer

The indexer is an important part of the Inscription world. It is used to track the wallets, quantities and other information of the Inscription tokens held to ensure that the Inscription market of cryptocurrency operates effectively.

The inscription data is only stored on the chain and is an original certificate. The update and check of the data rely on the indexer to solve the problems of indexing, retrieval, and settlement of the inscription ecological data.

At the same time, the indexer reads all inscription transaction information, checks which inscription is ""deployed"" first, and maintains the ""First is First"" criterion. By tracking which wallets deployed the original token supply, what the maximum limit was, when minting was terminated, and the traceability of those token wallets in the secondary market's'Transfer'.

Without indexers, inscriptions would be limited to indistinguishable Josn text files, and the market for inscriptions would cease to exist.

Embracing the spirit of Satoshi

UXUY actively embraces Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi, and is based on conducting inscription transactions and transfers through native protocols without relying on any project parties. UXUY calls on the market to adhere to the Declaration of Crypto Equality, abide by DMT ideas, and actively embrace the inscription infrastructure of Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi.

Bitcoin has revolutionized the world through a trustless system for financial transactions without intermediaries, and Inscription creates a fairer and more decentralized way of asset development, and the entire encryption industry will enter a ""trustless"" era.

(NASDAQ: WIMI) (WiMi or the Company), a leading global Hologram Augmented Rea","(MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq) Beijing, Dec. 26, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (NASDAQ: WIMI) (""WiMi"" or the ""Company""), a leading global Hologram Augmented Reality (""AR"") Technology provider, today announced that a decentralized file storage and sharing system is built by applying the bitcoin algorithm distributed hash table (DHT) technology.

The Bitcoin network is a distributed network consisting of many nodes with no centralized control node. WiMi draws on this decentralized idea to build a file storage and sharing network consisting of multiple nodes. Each node owns a certain amount of storage space and is interconnected with other nodes. This distributed storage eliminates the dependence on a single data center and improves data security and fault tolerance.

A DHT is an underlying algorithm for a distributed network that maps a file's hash to the address of the node storing the file via a huge file-indexed hash table. Bitcoin's algorithm can be applied to build such a DHT system for decentralized file storage and sharing. Bitcoin's algorithm provides strong technical support for decentralized storage with its decentralization, security, and immutability. DHT is a distributed mechanism for storing and retrieving data. In WiMi's system, DHT is used to slice files into small chunks and store these chunks dispersed across multiple nodes. Through the hash function of DHT, the system can determine the storage location of the file and realize efficient data retrieval. When a user uploads a file, the system slices it into small chunks and stores them on other eligible nodes; when a user downloads a file, the system retrieves the data chunks from the corresponding nodes and reassembles them into a complete file.

In this system, files are split into small chunks and hashes are computed using Bitcoin's hash algorithm. The hash of each file block is used as an index to map it to the address of the node where the file block is stored. In this way, when users need to access or share a file, they only need to provide the hash of the file block and the system will be able to look up the address of the node storing the file block from the DHT and transfer the file block to the user.

Decentralized technology improves system reliability and reduces the risk of a single point of failure by having nodes in the network work together to maintain and manage file storage and sharing. Bitcoin's hash algorithm and blockchain technology ensure file integrity and tamper-proofing by verifying the hash of a file block to protect the integrity of the file against tampering and corruption technology allows file blocks to be distributed across nodes in the network, enabling parallel and distributed file storage and sharing, improving system performance, and speeding up file transfers. In addition, Bitcoin's algorithm enables anonymous file storage and sharing, allowing users to upload and download files using anonymous identities to protect their privacy.

By utilizing Bitcoin's hash algorithm and blockchain technology, the integrity and tamper-proofing of files is effectively protected. The system verifies the hash of the file block to ensure the integrity of the file and prevent tampering and corruption. In addition, DHT technology allows file blocks to be distributed across nodes in the network, thus realizing parallel and distributed storage and sharing, greatly improving the performance of the system, as well as speeding up the transmission of files.

In addition to efficient and secure file storage and sharing, Bitcoin's algorithm provides the system with anonymity. Users can upload and download files using anonymous identities to protect their privacy. This anonymity feature increases users' trust in the system and comfort in using it and further satisfies their need for data security and privacy protection.

The decentralized file storage and sharing system built by WiMi that applied Bitcoin algorithm DHT technology, not only improves data security and reliability but also combines efficiency and anonymity. The application of this technology is of great significance in meeting the growing demand for file storage and sharing and promoting the development of the Internet.

B!TLYF has created a highly engaging external services rider for policyholders to become lifelong policyHODLers

- James EasonRALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, USA, December 27, 2023 /EINPresswire / -- B!TLYF , LLC a Wyoming chartered insurtech has filed for US and international patent protection for a novel system and method for configuring an insurance policy with Bitcoin. The company seeks to initially partner with a visionary life insurance carrier to begin product development and regulatory filing for a white labeled, digitally native, instant issue, term life policy under the brand name HODLIFE . Upon proof of concept, the company plans to partner with other insurance product lines for group life, whole life, auto and health.Today there are more than 50 million early adopters of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the USA (expected to be well over 1 billion worldwide in the next few years). HODLIFE will be a purpose-built policy designed specifically to be more contemporary and relevant to this massive Bitcoin consumer audience of affluent millennials (ages 27 – 42) - the sweet spot demographic for term life insurance.'We believe that Bitcoin is pure digital gold and this exciting new asset class is here to stay forever. Our patent pending external services rider will reward HODLIFE insurance consumers with Bitcoin - outside of the policy – for reducing their insurable risk and ultimately living a longer healthier life while at the same time improving their financial wellbeing.""We call it'Taking Steps & Stacking SATs', (SATs is crypto slang for the smallest unit of Bitcoin - like a penny vs. dollar) but it works just as well for Auto and Health insurance policies where one might'Drive Safe & Stack SATs' or maybe'Get Vaxed & Stack SATs', stated James Eason , co-founder of B!TLYF.'We are also anticipating the SEC may approve spot Bitcoin ETF's in January 2024 and that could lead to an additional 50 million Americans adding Bitcoin exposure in the near term. Our patent pending insurance innovation is a natural extension of the increasing adoption of Bitcoin worldwide', added Mike Casey, CFP and B!TLYF co-founder. Advising the B!TLYF founders as an equity partner is long time insurance industry icon Ken Leibow, owner of InsurTech Express. Ken brings decades of life insurance industry experience to the team and a deep passion for Blockchain technology integration.
