In addition, Allianz SE remained in its top spot by nonbanking assets, at $1.2 trillion, while Berkshire Hathaway Inc. rose to second place from fifth.

AM Best released the rankings of the world's largest global insurance companies, by NPW and nonbanking assets, in the Jan. 6, 2023, issue of Best's News. The two rankings are based on BestLink data and additional research.

Overall, the two rankings saw some reshuffling in the top spots, with U.S.-based health insurers further strengthening their leading positions. Centene Corp. and Elevance Health Inc. (formerly Anthem Inc.) advanced two places in the NPW ranking to come in at second and third. These gains came at the expense of two Chinese insurers — China Life Insurance (Group) Co. Ltd. and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd. Both Chinese insurers remained in the top five but China Life fell one slot to No. 4 and Ping An fell to No. 5 from No. 2.

Japan-based insurers National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, Japan Post Insurance, Dai-Ichi Life and Nippon Life all slipped in the ranking by nonbanking assets, with yen depreciation cited as a major driver. Nippon Life also fell the furthest on the NPW ranking, to No. 25 from No. 18.

The top 10 global insurers ranked by 2021 NPW are as follows:


UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, United States


Centene Corporation, United States


Elevance Health, Inc., United States


China Life Insurance (Group) Company, China


Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China Ltd., China


Kaiser Foundation Group of Health Plans, United States


AXA S.A., France


Allianz SE, Germany


People's Insurance Company (Group) of China Ltd., China


Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A., Italy


The top 10 global insurers ranked by 2021 non-banking assets are as follows:

On this robust cash flow generation, we plan to raise our fair value estimate by the midsingle digits on a percentage basis. After our fair value estimate change, UnitedHealth shares will probably remain slightly overvalued. Our economic moat rating, which remains narrow, recognizes the long-term policy risks the company faces primarily in medical insurance and pharmacy benefit management, although the shares appear to be benefiting from a particularly benign period of policy risk currently. Overall, UnitedHealth delivered a strong end to the year, with the medical insurance operations leading the way on the bottom line and the Optum franchises continuing to deliver strong growth, and the company was able to roughly meet or exceed our expectations for the full year. The company especially impressed on a free cash flow basis, generating $23 billion in free cash flow in 2022, or about $1 billion more than we had anticipated. It turned in $324 billion of sales in 2022, right in line with expectations, and exceeded its own guidance on the bottom line, with 17% growth in adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, slightly above management's most recent guidance of $21.85-$22.05. The company appears set for another strong year in 2023 as management maintained the guidance given at its November analyst day, including $357 billion-$360 billion of sales, adjusted EPS of $24.40-$24.90 (10%-12% growth, or slightly below its 13%-16% long-term target), and operating cash flows of $27 billion-$28 billion. Given the firm's penchant for exceeding guidance, especially on the bottom line, we intend to maintain our slightly higher assumptions for 2023.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Julie Utterback",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/LXJBXID3YBGOBOEX3EJZNPQ3NE.png,False,@MorningstarInc,9.989486,53dd1d7be338194270e08ca46ac57d0e

 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Analysis Group
, one of the largest international economics consulting firms, is honored to have worked on two matters recognized by 
Global Competition Review
's (GCR's) 2023 antitrust awards for ""creative, strategic, and innovative work by teams of in-house and external lawyers and economists.""

(PRNewswire)
UnitedHealth Group/Change Healthcare Merger
Analysis Group was acknowledged at the GCR awards ceremony for its work on 
US, et al. v. UnitedHealth Group Inc., et al.
, which was awarded ""Merger Control Matter of the Year – Americas."" The teams working on the merger successfully defeated all three theories of harm put forward by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and attorneys general from 
New York
 and 
Minnesota
 in their bid to block the 
$13 billion
 tie-up.
An Analysis Group team led by Principal 
Mark Lewis
, Vice President 
Emily Cotton
, and Manager 
Philipp Tillmann
 provided analytical support to academic affiliate 
Catherine Tucker
. In a portion of her testimony, Professor Tucker refuted one of the DOJ's chief objections to the transaction – that UnitedHealth would exploit its access to Change Healthcare's privileged information to unfair advantage over competitors. She explained that UnitedHealth would handicap its own business should it attempt to take anticompetitive advantage of the information made available through the merger. In allowing the merger to proceed, Judge 
Carl J. Nichols
 of the US District Court for the 
District of Columbia
 found that the government relied ""on speculation rather than real-world evidence"" for its claims that UnitedHealth would exploit Change's data and innovations to benefit its own health plan and disadvantage rivals. The companies closed the deal in 
October 2022
.
Broiler Chicken Criminal Antitrust Litigation 
Analysis Group was also recognized for its work on 
US v. Penn, et al.
, which was awarded ""Behavioural Matter of the Year – Americas."" In the matter, the DOJ alleged that the defendants engaged in an agreement to fix prices and rig bids for broiler chickens between 2012 and 2019. The DOJ charged the defendants with a criminal violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act for an alleged conspiracy to restrain trade. Following a hung jury in two prior trials, the DOJ took the unprecedented step of trying the case a third time.
An Analysis Group team led by Managing Principal 
Andrea Okie
; Principal 
Mark Lewis
; and Vice Presidents 
Kevin Gallagher, 
Ishita Rajani
, and 
David Smith
 supported academic affiliate Professor 
Edward Snyder
 in preparing his testimony for all three trials. In his testimony on the existence of economic evidence consistent with a price-fixing agreement during the third trial, Professor Snyder showed that exchanges of information are expected in the broiler chicken industry and do not necessarily indicate a conspiracy. He also showed that the at-issue prices were not systematically higher than a set of benchmark prices analyzed for the case. After two mistrials, the jury found all five executives charged in the third trial not guilty. The DOJ also subsequently dropped its charges against four other executives in a related matter before the federal criminal trial was set to begin.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month.

The Zacks  presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's  features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and AstraZeneca PLC (AZN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today's research reports here >>>



UnitedHealth shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+4.3% vs. +3.9%), but have lagged the broader market (+4.3% vs. +22.2%). The company's top line remains well-poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.



UnitedHealth's solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. The Government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividends.



However, membership in its global business continues to decline. High operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.



(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)



Shares of Chevron have gained +9.5% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry's gain of +20.0%. The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.



America's No. 2 energy firm's existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX's EPS jump 132% in 2022. However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially.



The company's high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor's 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.
