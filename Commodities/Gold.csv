The film, which premieres Monday as part of PBS's ""POV,"" is a portrait of the challenges many with disabilities face and their often invisible struggle. (In one scene, Davenport is stuck on an airplane after landing.) But it's also the work of a keenly observant filmmaker, with an eye for beauty and a uniquely poetic point of view. Davenport shot this autobiographical film largely with a handheld camera and, sometimes, with one affixed to his wheelchair. Last year, the film won him the documentary directing prize at the Sundance Film Festival. • The title of Sierra Pettengill's ""Riotsville, USA"" refers to a fake town the U.S. military created in the 1960s to hold exercises mimicking police and military response to rioting. The drills, staged in front of cardboard storefronts, helped make a violent playbook for controlling the era's social unrest. ""A door swung open in the late '60s,"" reads Charlene Modeste in narration penned by essayist Tobi Haslett. ""And someone, something, sprang up and slammed it shut."" Using archival footage from those exercises, ""Riotsville, U.S.A,"" which debuts Thursday, Jan. 12, on Hulu, wearily surveys the militarization of the police force. • Martin Scorsese's monthly series of free virtual screenings of restored classics continues Monday, with George Stevens' sweeping Texas epic ""Giant"" (1956), with Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean. A live screening, with commentary, will begin at 7 p.m. EDT. -- AP Film Writer Jake Coyle • Alt-country singer-songwriter Margo Price's fourth studio full-length album, ""Strays,"" includes the super kiss-off single ""Change of Heart,"" with the lyrics, ""If you break both your legs/Don't come running to me."" The album features contributions from Sharon Van Etten, Lucius and Mike Campbell, plus the previously released track ""Been to the Mountain."" On ""Lydia,"" Price illustrates the internal strife and self-doubt of a struggling woman who finds herself pregnant and unable to raise a child. The album is released Friday, Jan. 13.

Check out her new memoir, ""Maybe We'll Make It,"" which tracks her early years as an artist in Nashville. by signing up you agree to our terms of service • ""I got gothic babe tendencies/I always choose the dark,"" sings up-and-coming singer-songwriter Julia Wolf. Her debut full-length ""Good Thing We Stayed"" is set to drop on Friday, Jan. 13, and a highlight is the moody, lovely ""Gothic Babe Tendencies"" featuring blackbear. The Long Island-raised Wolf also leans into her dark side with the smooth and clever single ""Dracula"" and the lyrics, ""I call you Dracula/'Cause most of you people just can't even look in the mirror."" But she can also be cheeky, as with her sunny anthem ""Get Off My."" -- Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy • The team behind the Emmy-nominated HBO docuseries ""McMillions"" are out with a new investigative series called ""Gold, Lies & Videotape."" It's about a family who claims their ancestors discovered a fortune in gold bars, jewels and coins hidden in a New Mexico cave, now worth billions. Before they could remove it, an accident barricaded the entrance. The land was then blocked off by the government for military use. One man has been pushing for decades to obtain what he believes belongs to his family, because finders keepers, while others wonder if the treasure trove is just a myth. ""Gold, Lies & Videotape"" delves into this story in six-parts debuting Friday, Jan. 13 on Discovery Channel and discovery+. The series features images of the treasure plus archival footage and present-day interviews. • Andie MacDowell and Chyler Leigh (formerly of ""Grey's Anatomy,"") co-star in a new drama called ""The Way Home."" The pair play an estranged mother and daughter who haven't spoken in decades until Leigh's character's teen daughter, played by Sadie Laflamme-Snow, brings them together for the first time in 20 years to hopefully repair what's broken. The 10-episode series debuts Sunday, Jan. 15 on Hallmark Channel. -- Alicia Rancilio -- The manga/anime series ""One Piece"" has spun off dozens of games over the last 25 years, though it hasn't become quite as popular in America as ""Dragon Ball Z"" or ""Yu-Gi-Oh."" Still, Bandai Namco is hoping to attract franchise fans, as well as aficionados of Japanese role-playing games, with One Piece Odyssey. Monkey D. Luffy, the wannabe King of the Pirates, and his Straw Hat Crew are marooned on a mysterious island and have to figure out how to make their ship, the Thousand Sunny, seaworthy again. The publisher says ""One Piece"" mastermind Eiichiro Oda contributed the plot, new characters and new monsters to this adventure, and you can climb aboard Friday, Jan. 13, on the PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox X/S or PC. -- Lou Kesten",dailyherald.com,2869,news,US,en,Associated Press,https://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20230109/ENTLIFE/230109512/AR/0/AR-230109512.jpg&updated=202301061746&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder,False,@dailyherald,10.369382,1d60bfebc44752377a8b862db3e08d34

Asia-Pacific Market Briefing – US CPI Report Boosts Gold Prices as USD SinksGold prices roared higher on Thursday in the aftermath of December's US inflation report. Headline CPI crossed the wires at 6.5 percent y/y, which was in line with expectations and down from November's 7.1% result. There seemed to be rising expectations of a lower-than-anticipated outcome being priced in by markets. But, as expected, this was an unlikely scenario.Meanwhile, the core rate clocked in at 5.7%, which was also as expected and down from 6.0% prior. Looking at the chart below, we can see that the gap between headline and core continues to shrink. At 0.8 percentage points, it is now the smallest since February 2021. Meanwhile, the shelter component clocked in at 7.5% y/y! This means housing is outperforming both headline and core CPI.But, that is as expected due to the lag impact of housing as it slowly makes its way into official statistics. Peak shelter might occur between March and April. While energy prices continue to weaken, food has been sticky. The latter clocked in at 10.4% y/y. An ongoing egg shortage is also not helping. So, what were the key takeaways from a market perspective and precious metals?Well, markets are slowly taking away expectations of a further 2 rate hikes over the next couple of Federal Reserve policy meetings. This meant Treasury yields turned lower and the US Dollar weakened. Anti-fiat gold thus capitalized on this dynamic and may continue doing so in the near term. Silver also aimed higher, but XAG/USD has been unable to find a meaningful upside breakout.Looking ahead to Friday's Asia-Pacific trading session, gold may continue pushing higher. The economic docket is fairly quiet, leaving risk appetite as the key driver. Wall Street did finish in the green on Thursday, opening the door to a rosy session for indices like the ASX 200, Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng Index. That may bode ill for the haven-linked US Dollar.A Closer Look at InflationGold Technical AnalysisOn the daily chart, gold finally broke above the 1869 – 1879 resistance zone. Prices stopped right on the 100% Fibonacci extension level at 1897. This has also exposed April highs, which make for a key zone of resistance between 1978 and 1998. Negative RSI divergence is also no longer present, showing that upside momentum is picking up. Putting all of this together, gold might be aiming higher ahead.

It's worth noting that the market is trading between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, attracting traders from both sides of the trade and leading to choppy behavior. It's expected that we may face some trouble in this region but breaking above the 50-Day exponential moving average on a daily close could propel gold much higher.

This is likely, as traders seek to protect their wealth in the current environment. After all, do not underestimate the damage that was done to portfolios last year, and of course the havoc that all of the volatility that we have seen could have on the psychology of the overall market.

The 200-Day EMA has offered significant support , and systematic traders have joined in, pushing the market higher. As traders worry about currency depreciation worldwide, gold makes sense as a safe haven asset. The market is expected to try and reach towards the highs but breaking past the crucial $1900 level has been difficult for buyers in the past. If we do break above that level, a move towards the $2000 level is likely. Additionally, the 200-Day EMA sitting above the 50% fibonacci level makes sense. Because of this, I think the market is going to do everything you can to test those previous inverted hammers, and perhaps try to break above there.

Going forward, buying dips is likely to be the best approach to trading this market . However, keep in mind that volatility remains extreme in most markets, and multiple opportunities are expected to arise. You will more likely than not will have to look to short-term forex charts to place your trade, because the longer term traders are going to have to deal with a significant amount of volatility. The only way that a longer-term trader gets through this with their sanity is probably with a very small position, or completely unlevered due to all of the noise that I see in this market. Ultimately, gold is probably a nice long term holding, but in the short term it's going to be messy, so you need to be prepared for that. I don't have any interest in shorting this market anytime soon as gold has proven its resiliency at a major level in the last few days.

These operations pushed it towards the support level at $1805 an ounce, its lowest in two months, but the attempts to rebound I see that it is still weak.

It did not exceed the level of $1844 an ounce and settled around the level of $1835 an ounce. The weakness of the rebound in the first place amid the continued strength of the US dollar due to the expectations of raising interest rates by the US Federal Reserve Bank.

In general, the winds of hope in the month of March blow to the financial markets that the reopening of China will compensate for the weakness in other countries suffering from stubborn inflation and a worsening cost of living crisis. China's huge economy is recovering from the pain of the pandemic, with the latest reading of the closely watched survey on factory activity showing better-than-expected growth in February.

According to the official announcement, the Caixin General Manufacturing PMI rose to a reading of 51.6, beating expectations of 50.2, up from a reading of 49.2 in January. A level above 50 indicates growth and this is the best result since May 2021 before the stressful effects of rolling lockdowns took effect, and the first jump in activity since July, with new orders coming in, staffing levels increasing and production picking up. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose, on a wave of positivity with the outlook for next year being particularly well received, given optimism rising to a two-year high. The Covid crisis is quickly receding into the rearview mirror and the demand for raw materials to maintain factory lines is expected to be in rapid circulation.

At the same time, the price of brent crude rose in the wake of the news that it is heading towards $ 84 a barrel, amid expectations of increasing industry thirst for energy in China. The British pound gave up much of its gains, which had been driven by new expectations that the Bank of England will continue to raise interest rates and possibly keep them higher for longer.

Supply concerns also persisted as Russia cut oil exports further. But concerns about a slowdown in the US are keeping a cap on prices for the time being, as concerns persist about the delayed impact of higher interest rates on the world's largest economy. Over the course of the month, the benchmark index fell around 3%, highlighting the extent to which concerns about a global slowdown remain front and center despite a more positive picture regarding economic growth in China.

After a weak February, Wall Street appears to be starting the new month on another pessimistic note, with futures lower, as investors await the latest US PMI manufacturing and construction data. The preliminary reading for February continued to decline.

There will be a close rehearsal of any clues as to whether, in the final readings, the level of business activity proves more resilient and any change to the upside could add fresh concern about inflation which is proving very sticky. The UK housing market is back in sharp focus today as the Nationwide House Price Index fell for the sixth month in a row. Buyers are dominating the market at the moment. They know they have the upper hand, since public interest is so weak, so they're clearly bullish about getting discounts from sellers.

There is some hope that lower deals now on the market, compared to the fall's horrific mortgage mayhem may see demand increase, but it's still too early to tell how far rates will fall. XAU/USD gold price forecast today:

There is no change in my technical view of the performance of the gold market. According to the performance on the daily timeframe chart, the general trend of the XAU/USD gold price is still bearish. We indicated in the recent technical analysis of the gold price that approaching the psychological support level of $1800 will deepen the movement of the technical indicators towards oversold levels. It can be expected to think about buying while not taking risks from support levels at 1800 and 1785 dollars an ounce, respectively. From the last level, it is better to start thinking about buying gold.

The resistance stations at 1845 and 1872 dollars, respectively, will be the most important for an exit from the current bearish channel. The price of gold today will be affected by the level of the US dollar, in response to the number of weekly US jobless claims and statements by some US monetary policy officials, as well as the extent to which investors are willing to take risks or not.

This paper examines the use of the return on gold instead of treasury bills in empirical asset pricing models for the US equity market. It builds upon previous research on the safe-haven, hedging, and zero-beta characteristics of gold in developed markets and the close relationship between interest rates, stock, and gold returns. In particular, we extend this research by showing that using gold as a zero-beta asset helps to improve the time-series performance of asset pricing models when pricing US equities and industries between 1981 and 2015. The performance of gold zero-beta models is also compared with traditional empirical factor models using the 1-month Treasury bill rate as the risk-free rate. Our results indicate that using gold as a zero-beta asset leads to higher R-squared values, lower Sharpe ratios of alphas, and fewer significant pricing errors in the time-series analysis. Similarly, the pricing of small stock and industry portfolios is improved. In cross-section, we also find improved results, with fewer cross-sectional pricing errors and more economically meaningful pricing of risk factors. We also find that a zero-beta gold factor constructed to be orthogonal to the Carhart four factors is significant in cross-section and helps to improve factor model performance on momentum portfolios. Furthermore, the Fama–French three- and five-factor asset pricing models and the Carhart model are all improved by these means, particularly on test assets which have been poorly priced by the traditional versions. Our results have salient implications for policymakers, governments, central bank rate-setting decisions, and investors.

A number of factors, such as the US dollar 's decline, falling bond yields, and the allure of gold as a safe haven, played a role.

The current scenario appears to be favourable for a gold rally similar to the one that occurred during the 2008 global financial crisis, which saw a gain from $680 to $1920 over a three-year period. Similar circumstances exist today, but we can clearly see banks collapsing, a recession developing, and central banks accumulating gold. In the near future (within the next year), gold prices could easily test $2200, which would allow them to test the 66,000 level on the domestic market (India always loves gold when it rises) and possibly reach 64,000 by year's end, which is a revision from the original target of 62,000 given the current fundamentals.",investing.com,1372,finance,ES,en,Kedia Advisory,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/1a1c6cfd370b69857e45d7bec7389f83_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,10.985969,d081af952d5cdd2cf8500168b9049b46

On the contrary, gold showcased a double-digit growth in FY23 and came out as one of the best-performing asset classes in the financial year.

Going ahead, the yellow metal is widely expected to give double-digit returns in the new financial year 2023-24, and experts suggest investors continue holding on to the commodity compared to risky assets amid the global situation.

In FY23, the prices of gold jumped by 15% beating all other asset classes, and rallied by a massive Rs 8,000 in Indian markets from Rs 52,000 to Rs 60,000, said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research analyst at LKP Securities in a note sent to Investing.com.

'Gold has been proven a perfect hedge in the Portfolio giving out strong returns,' he said.

In terms of return on investment, gold continues to look lucrative from a safety perspective at a time when inflation remains high globally and the interest cycle is yet to ease.

These factors will provide a further push for the yellow metal and are expected to give returns of another 10-15% in FY24.

'The prices can easily touch 66000-68000 on base case performance before we reach the FY24 end next year. On the back of weak and uncertain performance in risky assets it is strongly advised to remain invested in Gold for further 10-15% returns on the base case and 15-20% on bull case scenario,' Trivedi added.",investing.com,1372,finance,ES,en,Malvika Gurung,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/42a92baeb267202d6c1196dc71beadaf_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,10.023191,0f9380e9929990e3f2ef7b25cfbac898

gold
 or shares of 
gold mining stocks
 in their portfolios may want to pay attention to the precious metal, which is approaching a record high above $2,000. 


In the 1920s, economist John Maynard Keynes called the gold standard a 'barbarous relic.' But even though the dollar hasn't been tied to the price of gold for decades, price moves of the metal can still shed light on what investors, central bankers, analysts and economists are thinking about the greenback, 
inflation
 and the economy in general.

Gold is often considered a safe-haven investment along with the 
U.S. dollar
 and 
Treasurys
, but they all compete for that status, with currency, bonds and gold alternately outshining one another. 


Sometimes, when equities experience a severe short-term drop, investors may sell gold to raise cash. Other times, such as the 
Federal Reserve's
 recent aggressive interest rate hikes, non-interest-bearing gold becomes less attractive. 


But 
Treasury yields
 have been on the decline since March, as investors have sought the safety of government bonds even as the dollar has lost value against a basket of major world currencies. 


This flight to safety — based on less-than-desirable economic data and concerns about the global banking industry — is also giving gold substantial tailwinds. 


 'An attractive backdrop for gold oftentimes implies more negatives than positives in the overall macro outlook.' — Craig Giventer, managing director of portfolio strategies at investment advisor GYL Financial Synergies 


Lower Treasury yields make the metal more attractive. A lower dollar boosts demand for gold from those holding other currencies. Inflationary worries, stemming in part from 
higher oil prices after a production cut announcement from OPEC


 and its allies, are also in the mix. 


But crucially, it's the worry among investors that the economy could enter a 
recession
 that is behind gold's rise, as that increases the likelihood of a slowdown in rate hikes and also stokes desire for gold as a safe haven. 


Here are some factors to consider as you weigh the price of gold as an economic indicator and what that means for your stock portfolio: 


— Recession worries as a driver of higher gold prices.


— How should stock market investors position themselves?


— Drawbacks of investing in gold now.

Recession Worries as a Driver of Higher Gold Prices


'An attractive backdrop for gold oftentimes implies more negatives than positives in the overall macro outlook,' says Craig Giventer, managing director of portfolio strategies at investment advisor GYL Financial Synergies. 'A litany of incrementally negative developments since Jan. 1, such as inflation still running higher than the Fed's comfort level; stress in the U.S. and European banking sectors; ongoing geopolitical tension and armed conflict; an increasing probability of the U.S. entering recession in the 2023/2024 period; and, to top it all off, the historical indictment of a former U.S. president, have all created a favorable environment for the safe-haven asset of gold.' 


On April 13, the price of gold for immediate delivery topped $2,046, its highest point since March 2022 and within spitting distance of its all-time high just above $2,070 in 2020. 'Fears of recession, the recent cap on oil production and significant turmoil in the banking sector are key drivers behind this,' says Joseph Cavatoni, market strategist with the World Gold Council, an industry group. 


 'We're seeing investor behaviors that we tend to (see) in times of distress and recession. We see people turning to things like gold and Treasurys, and that's something that people do when they're a lot more concerned about what's going on in the economy.' — Michael Wagner, chief operating officer, Omnia Family Wealth 


Jonathan Rose, CEO of precious metals investment firm Genesis Gold Group, forecasts that gold could go as high as $2,250 by the end of this year as stubbornly high inflation slows economic growth and tips the economy into a recession. He also cites worries about the 
U.S. debt ceiling


, supply chain issues and faltering confidence in the real estate market. 


'We're seeing investor behaviors that we tend to (see) in times of distress and recession,' says Michael Wagner, chief operating officer with Florida-based investment advisor Omnia Family Wealth, which holds gold in client portfolios. 'We see people turning to things like gold and Treasurys, and that's something that people do when they're a lot more concerned about what's going on in the economy.'

How Should Stock Market Investors Position Themselves?


While diversification is important within a portfolio, with stocks Giventer is leaning toward defensive companies with low debt that have good returns on capital, strong relative growth prospects and pricing power. 


Defensive stocks
 are less tied to economic cycles than so-called 
cyclical equities
. Investors often buy defensive plays because they think a recession is coming in an attempt to preserve the value of their portfolios and still earn a steady return. 


Defensive stocks often come from market sectors where consumers and businesses will still purchase products and services regardless of what the economy is doing. This includes sectors like health care, utilities and 
consumer staples
. 


Even though many market participants expect a U.S. recession late in 2023, there is little agreement on the depth and duration of it, says Amelia Bourdeau, market strategist for Diamond Standard, a diamond 
commodities
 company that tracks gold prices alongside the performance of the precious stones. For the moment, U.S. equities have held up relatively well despite the economic uncertainty because earnings outlooks have not been meaningfully revised lower, she says. 


Still, market and U.S. economic outlook uncertainty is continuing, meaning U.S. equity trading will likely remain choppy, she says. 


'It would be prudent to position for a recession or growth slowdown through holding health care and consumer staples,' she says. 


Beyond equities, investors can consider putting money into gold in a variety of ways. One popular way is by owning physical gold in the form of bars, coins or jewelry. Investors who want exposure to physical gold without the hassle of storing and insuring it can consider physically backed gold 
exchange-traded funds
, which have shares tied to gold stored in bank vaults. 


Investors can also explore gold 
futures
 and 
options
, but these investments are often best left to the pros. Of course, investors can also buy stocks or ETFs of gold mining companies. 


Drawbacks of Investing in Gold Now


Still, there are downsides to gold that investors should consider. 


Robert Johnson, finance professor at Creighton University, goes so far as to recommend never considering gold as an investment if you have a 
long time horizon
 because the precious metal has underperformed stocks over the long term. 


'While having a small position in precious metals may dampen portfolio 
volatility
 in the short run, the trade-off between slightly dampened volatility and the lost long-term return is certainly not a prudent one,' Johnson says. 


Also, keep in mind that trying to time the market by making big changes in a portfolio is a risky endeavor. 


'Many people have been preparing for a recession for years and have exited the stock market,' Johnson says. 'The 
opportunity cost
 of such a strategy is quite high. Instead, people should invest in a low-fee, diversified equity index fund and continue to invest consistently whether the market is up, down or sideways.'

Markets readjusting their expectations of the Fed's rate-hike course caused the slump. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard stated that the US central bank should keep raising interest rates because recent statistics revealed that inflation remained persistent. The euro zone's inflation fell last month, but underlying readings remained stubbornly high, with Britain's inflation being the highest in Western Europe, fueling fears of rate hikes by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.

A flood of Fed speakers is scheduled to talk this week, ahead of a blackout period that begins on the weekend before the central bank's May meeting. The physical gold purchase became unappealing across major Asian centers as prices rose, depressing enthusiasm ahead of a significant gold-buying holiday in India. In top buyer China, bullion changed hands at $1-$5 premiums to spot prices, down from $26-$40 premiums last month. In India, traders offered discounts of up to $22 per ounce off official domestic pricing, compared to $32 last week.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER PRICE ON INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices rose on Tuesday after two sessions of losses as the dollar eased, while investors sought more clarity on the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, reported news agency Reuters.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was up 0.3 per cent at $2,001.09 per ounce, as of 0310 GMT. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures rose 0.3 per cent to $2,012.40.
Similarly, spot silver fell 0.2 per cent to $25.06 per ounce. 
Gold prices fell to an about two-week low on Monday after data showed manufacturing activity in New York state increased for the first time in five months, and confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders improved for a fourth straight month in April. The data added to bets of an interest rate hike by the Fed at its May meeting.

GOLD, SILVER RATES ON INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices slipped on Friday as the dollar steadied, although softer U.S. economic data reinforced expectations for a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate-hike cycle after a likely increase next month, reported news agency Reuters.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was down 0.1 per cent at $2,003.33 per ounce, as of 0102 GMT, after rising 1 per cent on Thursday. On the other hand, spot silver fell 0.2 per cent to $25.23 per ounce. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures fell 0.2 per cent to $2,014.80.
Gold is considered a hedge against inflation but higher interest rates dim the non-yielding asset's appeal. The dollar index was steady, making gold less affordable for buyers holding other currencies.

Gold 
prices
 gained slightly over the past 24 hours after the worst 2-day loss since early February. The anti-fiat yellow metal benefited from a cautiously weaker US Dollar as traders continued to fine-tune their expectations of where the Federal Reserve might take interest rates later this year.
During Tuesday's 
Wall Street
 trading session, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic spoke and noted that he favors one 
rate hike
 before 'going on hold'. He added that a recession is not in his baseline outlook and that the central bank 'will do what it takes' to bring down inflation to 2%.
This commentary might have kept the US Dollar restrained and thus offered XAU/
USD
 some lift. Focusing on Wednesday's Asia-Pacific trading session, the economic docket is lacking notable economic event risk. That may keep traders focused on general risk appetite, which is fairly quiet for the time being.
XAU/USD Daily Chart
On the daily chart, gold continues to face the downside risk of the aftermath of a Bearish Engulfing. Downside follow-through has been lacking, with prices being supported by the 20-day Simple Moving Average. Positive RSI divergence was present before the Bearish Engulfing formed, hinting that upside momentum was fading. For the time being, watch the moving average for key support. In the event of a turn higher, the 2022 high at 2070.42 remains a key level to watch.

Gold  Analysis - Bullish
According to 
IG Client  (IGCS)
, about 58% of retail traders are net-long gold. IGCS tends to function as a contrarian indicator. Since most traders are net-long, this hints prices may fall. But, upside exposure has decreased by 5.14% and 5.45% compared to yesterday and last week, respectively. With that in mind, recent changes in exposure warn that prices may soon reverse higher once more.

Blame it on the hike in rates of the precious yellow metal, both 22-carat and 24-carat. Jewellers across the cities said although people continued to purchase both light and heavyweight jewellery items on the day, which is considered auspicious to buy precious metal or start something new, gold sales were comparatively less than in the last two years.

In 2021 when gold sales had picked up post-pandemic, the price was Rs 49,500 per 10 gram and in 2020, the price of the yellow metal was hovering over Rs 50,000 per 10 gram.
 
Sridhar Epari of Epari Sadashiv Jewellers said during the pandemic there was a slump in gold sales but when markets opened after that, there was an almost 30 to 40 per cent rise in the sales in 2021 and 2022. President of Odisha Jewellers Association Sourav Roy said since the prices have increased, the quantity of gold sold this time was less by 30 to 35 per cent.
 
'The exact amount of gold sold can only be known on Monday,' he said. There are around 300 shops in Twin City under the association. Lightweight jewellery and gold coins sold the most while silver sold in larger quantities. People bought silver coins, chains, anklets and ‘jhuntia' with 10 gram of the metal priced at Rs 804.

Rowe Price Dividend Growth to Gold,Sachin Nagarajan,2023-05-05 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1155570/why-we-upgraded-t-rowe-price-dividend-growth-to-gold,morningstar.com,"Also, Dodge & Cox Emerging Markets Stock comes under full coverage and other April ratings highlights.","Increased conviction in T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth's 
PRDGX
 veteran manager and solid supporting cast upgraded its People Pillar to High from Above Average. That boosted the strategy's Morningstar Medalist Rating to Gold from Silver across all share classes and its exchange-traded fund.
 
Longtime manager Tom Huber's absolute track record is strong, but his risk-adjusted results are even more impressive. The 8.2% annualized gain of the strategy's no-load share class since his March 2000 start through April 2023 beat its S&P 500 prospectus benchmark's 6.5% and typical large-blend Morningstar Category peer's 6.4%. The strategy's annualized Sharpe ratio over Huber's tenure was nearly 40% higher than the index.
 
Huber's experience, deep knowledge and talented supporting cast should help the strategy continue outperforming. He has amassed one of the longest track records in the large-blend category since taking this strategy over in 2000. He started at T. Rowe Price as an analyst covering industries like retail, leisure, and gaming in 1994. Though it saw some changes last year, the analyst team Huber draws from remains large and skilled. In March 2022, T. Rowe Price split into two distinct research entities—T. Rowe Price Investment Management and T. Rowe Price Associates—but Huber's team, which remains in the latter group, is still capable.
 
That team follows a sensible approach. Huber looks for dividend-paying stocks with the financial strength to keep paying and increasing their payouts and good prospects for outperforming the S&P 500 with less volatility. Such businesses tend to have deep competitive advantages, ample cash flow, and leaders who are disciplined capital allocators and put shareholders first. Huber's focus on dividend growth means the overall portfolio's yield won't be high by absolute standards, but its payouts may be more reliable.
 
Huber has distinguished himself in down markets. Businesses that are heathy enough to increase their dividends tend to ride out market turbulence better than financially weaker ones. That has proved true in every bear market Huber has seen as a manager. In 2002, for example, the strategy's no-load shares dropped 10.2% versus the S&P 500′s 18.1% loss. That was a top-decile category finish, thanks to strong consumer discretionary, financials, and technology stock picks.
 
New to Coverage
 
Dodge & Cox Emerging Markets Stock 
DODEX
 earned a Medalist Rating of Bronze as it came under full analyst coverage in April 2023. This relatively new offering relies on Dodge & Cox's signature bottom-up, value investing approach with a twist. Like the firm's other funds, an investment committee that includes veterans of other strategies approves undervalued stocks for this portfolio. Unlike its siblings, though, most of this fund's ideas come from a quantitative model focused on valuation, business quality, management effectiveness, and growth. Analysts spot-check the model's recommendations before informing the investment committee. That's an efficient way to navigate a large universe, but it doesn't make the most of the firm's fundamental research edge. However, the strategy is likely to evolve at the edges and looks decent with its low fee.
 
Ratings Roundup
 
Morningstar analysts updated the Medalist Ratings for 672 fund share classes, exchange-traded funds, separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts, and model portfolios in April 2023. Of these, 546 retained their previous rating, 34 earned upgrades, 73 received downgrades, and 15 were new to coverage, and four were placed under review. Looking through share classes and vehicles to their underlying strategies, Morningstar issued 162 Medalist Ratings throughout April.

India Gold Futures on MCX hit a record high of Rs 61,498/kg on Thursday after international prices of the gold metal scaled a lifetime high of 2,082.8 an ounce earlier today.

Gold prices touched a record high after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the overnight Wall Street session by 25 basis points but flagged a more stringent approach for hiking rates further amid worsening economic conditions.

The yellow metal benefited from increased safe-haven demand as Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that economic growth was cooling and that credit conditions were likely to tighten further amid growing pressure on U.S. banks.

'Fed's indication of a possible rate hike pause in the next meeting provided a favourable environment for gold prices, as the dollar index drifted lower towards the $101 level and bond yields remained under pressure, resulting in upward momentum for gold,' said Deveya Gaglani of Axis Securities, cited Reuters.

In its May policy statement, FOMC said it ""will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy,"" moving away from its prior language in March that called for 'some additional policy firming,"" suggesting that a pause on hikes is in play for June, an Investing.com report stated.",investing.com,1372,finance,ES,en,Malvika Gurung,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/b9a58c8520c7b1c4fd35f41078d8c631_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,10.148048,3a5e7472edc5d17928f8682fb80124d5

GOLD, SILVER RATES ON INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices ticked down on Friday as the dollar held firm, although persistent economic fears and the U.S. debt ceiling standoff cushioned bullion's further decline, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold fell 0.3 per cent to $2,010.29 per ounce by 0301 GMT and was down 0.3 per cent for the week. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures shed 0.3 per cent to $2,015.00.
Spot silver fell 0.8 per cent to $23.98 per ounce.
Gold rose on Thursday after data showed a jump in weekly jobless claims and the smallest annual increase in producer prices last month in over two years, but the metal lost its allure as the U.S. dollar gained upper hand, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers.

The 43-year-old's handicraft business – teak artwork – was hurt after she lost most of her overseas clients during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
Yet she is shelling out 3 million rupiah (RM899) for three modest rings weighing in at no more than 1g each.
 
Two will go to her daughter, who celebrates her 17th birthday in June, and one – accented with a zirconia – Endang will keep for herself.
 
'I set money aside for her sweet 17th birthday,' she said. She also admitted that she sold some of her family's gold to sustain them during the Covid-19 pandemic, but would not say how much.
 
'Business isn't like it was before the pandemic, but at least it's not zero, so I thought I could buy a ring for myself,' added Endang.
 
As economies recover from Covid-19, Asian households are renewing their love affair with gold even as its price tests new highs.
 
Malleable, widely prized and – most importantly – wearable, gold has a special place in Asian hearts.
 
In times of crisis and uncertainty, the metal remains the go-to asset for rainy days.
 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, spiralling food and energy prices, and – most recently – bank failures in the United States have generated plenty of uncertainty.
 
For a month now, the price of gold has fluctuated around US$2,000 (RM8,993) per ounce, not far off its record high of nearly US$2,070 in 2020. The global price of the metal has climbed by 22% since October.
 
While Asia's love affair with the yellow stuff is not necessarily new, the determination among many households to claw back gold stands out.
 
In 2019, Chinese consumer demand for gold totalled 900 tonnes; the figure dropped to 825 tonnes as at the end of 2022. Indonesian consumer demand for gold was at 50 tonnes at the end of 2022, four tonnes less than in 2019.
 
Chinese consumer demand for gold soared by a fifth to nearly 280 tonnes in the first quarter of the year, according to latest World Gold Council data.
 
Indonesian demand rose by more than a 10th to 12 tonnes. Thai consumer purchases of the metal ticked up to four tonnes.
 
Michael Choo, a Singapore-based retail investor who has been following the market for gold for nearly three decades, would not dare guess which way prices are headed owing to cross currents buffeting the metal.
 
'Looking at the long run, I feel that metals like gold are a great choice to tackle inflation,' Choo, a retired principal in his mid-50s, said. — The Straits Times/ANN",thestar.com.my,1823,news,MY,en,,https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,False,,10.95531,a9e4a0171a82bf823220e379addd083c

Gold prices steadied on Wednesday below the $2,000-mark as investors fretted over the outcome from the U.S. debt-limit negotiations, with a firmer dollar keeping prices in check, news agency Reuters reported.

Gold has been well supported on price dips below $2,000 and with the debt ceiling ""process dragging-on, there is some pent-up frustration in the market which is adversely affecting sentiment', and that could bring safe-haven flows into gold, Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade said, reported Reuters.
Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.3 per cent to $23.80 per ounce.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD PRICE ON INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices ticked up on Friday but were on course for their biggest weekly drop in 3-1/2 months as hopes of a resolution in the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and fading expectations of a rate cut by year-end took some shine off bullion, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was up 0.3 per cent to $1,963.39 per ounce by 0418 GMT, but on track for a 2.4 per cent weekly drop, its biggest since early February. U.S. gold futures rose 0.2 per cent to $1,964.60.
Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.6 per cent to $23.64 per ounce.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER PRICE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold rose on Friday as the dollar pulled back from a two-month high, but bullion was poised for a third straight weekly fall as traders assessed the progress of U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and the Federal Reserve's next policy move, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was up 0.3 per cent to $1,945.39 per ounce by 0311 GMT, after hitting its lowest since March 22 at $1,936.59. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures edged up 0.1 per cent to $1,945.90.
There is an overwhelming market expectation that the debt crisis will be resolved, and a still overall tightening horizon from the Fed that is expected to put some downward pressure on gold, said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, reported Reuters.
Gold could still reach $1,980 or close to the $2,000 level in June, supported by steady physical demand in key markets like India and China and overall economic uncertainty, said Ajay Kedia, director at Kedia Commodities in Mumbai.
Spot silver rose 0.3 per cent to $22.83, among other precious metals.

The demand for gold jewellery in the March quarter fell 17% to 78 tonnes in the quarter ended March this year, compared to 94 tonnes in the same quarter in the previous year, according to the latest data released by the World Gold Council (WGC).
 
A similar fall was witnessed in the investment demand for the yellow metal as investors bought 34.4 tonnes of gold bars and coins in the first quarter of this year compared to 41 tonnes of gold bars and coins in the same quarter of the previous year.
 
Industry stakeholders blame high prices for muted demand for precious metals. Gold prices have risen around 10% so far this year and touched a record high of Rs 61,490 per 10 gram last month. However, prices have cooled a little and gold is currently trading at around Rs 60,800 per 10 gram.
 
'In the context of the record high local gold price, it was unsurprising to see such lacklustre jewellery demand. Indian consumers are keenly aware of- and sensitive to - moves in the local gold price,' said a report by WGC. Global factors are pushing up the prices of gold, say experts.
 
In the past year, the world has seen the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, monetary tightening due to steep hikes in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve and the collapse of banks in the US and Europe.

The yellow metal saw little support even as the dollar sank to three-week lows after the Fed decision, with the prospect of more rate hikes keeping traders largely wary of non-yielding assets.

While Wednesday's decision marks the first time the bank has held rates steady since embarking on a rate hike cycle in 2022, the Fed also increased its benchmark rate forecast to a peak rate of 5.6% in 2023, up from a prior forecast of 5.1% - suggesting at least two more 25 basis point hikes.

Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,939.01 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,950.87 an ounce by 20:56 ET (00:56 GMT). The yellow metal reversed most intraday gains and settled flat on Wednesday following the Fed's decision.

Gold longs disappointed by hawkish Fed outlook

While markets had widely expected the Fed to keep rates on hold, the forecast of at least two more hikes threw a curveball for traders anticipating an extended pause in the bank's rate hike cycle.

Gold in particular was expected to benefit from the prospect of U.S. interest rates remaining static for the remainder of the year, given that higher rates push up the opportunity cost of holding gold.

But the prospect of future rate hikes may dent the yellow metal's appeal, even as global economic conditions deteriorate and demand for safe havens increases.

Gold has stuck to a tight trading range for nearly a month amid uncertainty over the Fed, and is now likely to stay within that range in the near-term amid a dearth of strong cues for movement.

Hawkish signals from the Fed saw markets completely write off expectations for any rate cuts by the central bank this year - a scenario that bodes poorly for metal markets.

Copper falls, more China rate cuts awaited

Among industrial metals, copper prices crept lower after the Fed decision, although markets were now awaiting more cues on major importer China.

Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.8448 a pound. The red metal rallied sharply earlier this week after the People's Bank of China cut a short-term interest rate to support local economic growth.

Markets now expect the PBOC to enact more rate cuts as it moves to spruce up a slowing economic rebound in China. More stimulus in the country is expected to drive up economic activity and fuel copper demand later this year.",investing.com,1372,finance,ES,en,Investing.com,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/fd5668bd80c0670f50590688bfafea45_w_800_h_450.jpg,False,,11.5064745,222098aa6d6760ce423a1baf799dd158

Gold prices moved in a tight range on Friday as traders weighed recent U.S. economic data and hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, while a relatively softer dollar provided some support to bullion.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was flat at $1,957.84 per ounce by 0238 GMT. U.S. gold futures too were listless at $1,970.30.
""Gold is struggling to move higher because the Fed's message on inflation and interest rates still remains hawkish. So, it's sort of removing the incentive to buy gold because there are more interest rate increases on the horizon,"" said Edward Meir, a metals analyst at Marex.
While gold is considered a safe haven during economic uncertainties, higher interest rates dull the appeal for zero-yield bullion.
Spot silver advanced 0.2 per cent to $23.9098 per ounce, among other precious metals.

pot gold ticked down 0.1 per cent to $1,911.32 per ounce by 0246 GMT, and was down 2.4 per cent for the week. U.S. gold futures edged lower 0.1 per cent to $1,921.20.
""Gold has extended lower out of the range that it was occupying for a few weeks, suggesting there is more weakness ahead. The decline matches up with the upshift in yields, reflecting hawkish comments from Powell & Fed officials more generally,"" Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.

Spot gold was trading at $1,918.59 per ounce.

Investors were waiting for a raft of US economic data that could influence Federal Reserve policy about interest rates. The yellow metal is sensitive to rising interest rates, as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

Manish Jaradi, a strategist, dailyFX, said minutes of the Fed meeting showed almost all officials agreed to hold interest rates steady at the June meeting, even though some participants wanted to move ahead with a rate hike.

'Still, 16 out of 18 officials still expected the benchmark interest rate to rise at least another quarter of a percentage point by the end of the year,' said Jaradi.

Prices rose from EGP 2,2","The weak demand was due to the holiday season when people are less likely to buy gold. Speculation on gold prices also contributed to the fluctuation, as investors bought and sold gold in anticipation of future price movements.

Global gold prices also played a role in the fluctuation of local prices. Gold prices on the global market fell to their lowest level in three months before recovering to above $1,900 an ounce.

The Egyptian government has taken some steps to increase the supply of gold in the local market. In May, the government exempted gold imports from customs duties. So far, about 300 kilograms of gold have been imported under this exemption.

The Gold Division at the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce has also increased the processing value of gold jewellery by 10%, starting from July. This will make gold jewellery more expensive, but it could also help to increase demand for gold.

The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has kept interest rates unchanged at 18.25% for the second time in a row. This stability in interest rates could help to support the Egyptian pound and make gold more affordable for investors.

Overall, the gold market in Egypt is expected to remain volatile in the near future. However, the government's efforts to increase the supply of gold and stabilize the pound could help to reduce the volatility in the market.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-07/03/DNE_4e118image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,10.478483,755fa6ce7de74deb5cbb9d87917c6c79

Jun Rong Yeap, contributor for dailyFX, said another dip in the US core inflation data may reinforce some degree of success in the US Federal Reserve's tightening moves thus far and leaves room for the Fed to consider a prolonged rate pause for more policy flexibility.

'Any upside surprise in inflation may put chatters of more rate hikes on the table but given that a 25 basis-point hike is already heavily priced for the upcoming Fed meeting and the broader trend for inflation is still to the downside, it may potentially have to take a significant beat in inflation numbers to drive a pronounced recalibration in rate pricing,' said Yeap.

GOLD, SILVER PRICE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET

According to the latest metal report, spot gold was steady at $1,923.62 per ounce by 0347 GMT. U.S. gold futures were down 0.2% at $1,929.50 per ounce.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER PRICES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices were set on Friday for their biggest weekly gain since April, after rallying close to a one-month high, as markets scale back expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes, sending the dollar to its lowest in more than a year, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was up 1.9 per cent to $1,959.81 per ounce by 1741 GMT, hitting its highest since June 16. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures ticked up 0.1 per cent to $1,964.
According to Matt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index, gold has potential to sort of increase from here. He added that the next significant levels may be between $1,985 and $2,000.
However, Simpson continued, ""that could cause some nervousness (among gold investors) if the Fed does indicate more rate increases.""
Among other precious metals, spot silver fell by 0.2 per cent to $24.8091 per ounce.

(TSXV: WINS) (‘Winshear', the ‘Company', or the ‘Claimant'), formerly...","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
Winshear Gold Corp. (TSXV: WINS)
 (‘Winshear', the ‘Company', or the ‘Claimant'), formerly Helio Resource Corp., provides the following update on the recent move in its share price, which is related to the Company's fully funded arbitration proceedings against the Tanzanian Government to recover its investment and damages for the expropriation of its SMP Gold Project in Tanzania.   
 
Richard Williams, CEO of Winshear, stated
: 'We learned this morning that ASX listed Indiana Resources has been awarded US$109.5 million in its international arbitration case against Tanzania in addition to an order for Tanzania to repay US$3,859,161 in legal costs and expenses. It is reassuring that the ICSID tribunal in the Indiana case against Tanzania recognised the damage done to shareholders, investors and Indiana when the Tanzanian government decided to abolish Retention Licences without consulting the investor community. Indiana's arbitration was conducted through the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ('ICSID) and concluded two weeks prior to Winshear's arbitration proceedings at ICSID against Tanzania in February 2023. We look forward to receiving the outcome of our case against Tanzania.'
 
Winshear and Indiana are separately seeking to recover costs and damages from the government of Tanzania, through the ICSID arbitration process, for the expropriation of Retention Licenses that covered their respective flagship exploration projects. The ICSID Convention has been ratified by 158 States, including Tanzania. An award issued by an ICSID tribunal is enforceable in any one of those 158 member States as if it were a judgment of one of their own courts.
 
Background to Winshear's Claim 
 
In July 2017, the Government of Tanzania amended the Mining Act 2010 by, 
inter alia
, abolishing the Retention Licence classification. The Company's SMP Mineral Resource was wholly contained within four Retention Licences.
 
On 10 January 2018, Tanzania published the new Mining (Mineral Rights) Regulations 2018, which cancelled all Retention Licences at which point they ceased to have any legal effect. The rights over all areas under Retention Licences, including the Retention Licences held for the SMP Gold Project, were immediately transferred to the Government of Tanzania.
 
During the time from January 2018 to December 2019, the Company actively engaged with the Tanzanian Ministry for Minerals and the Mining Commission in an effort to resolve a suitable tenure mechanism for the Project Licence to be reinstated, without success.
 
On 19 December 2019, the Mining Commission of Tanzania announced a public invitation to tender for the joint development of areas covered previously by Retention Licences. The invitation provided that the successful bidder should compensate the previous Retention Licence holder.
 
On 20 December 2019, the Mining Commission of Tanzania announced a revised public invitation to tender, which removed the condition that the successful bidder compensate the previous retention licence holder.
 
Through the measures described above, Tanzania has removed the ownership of the Project from the Claimant, and the Claimant alleges that Tanzania, in doing so, has breached its obligations to the Claimant under the Canadian-Tanzania BIT and international law. These include, but are not limited to:
 
Tanzania's obligation not to nationalise or expropriate the Claimant's investments or subject them to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation under the BIT; and
Tanzania's obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to the Claimant's investment and not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimant's investment under the BIT.
 
Under the BIT, the evidentiary hearing in Washington was video recorded and is available to the public for review. Winshear has provided a link to the video in the 
April 4, 2023, press release on its website.
 
Winshear is represented by the same international law firms that represented Indiana in the arbitration process: LALIVE LLP and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Both firms specialise in international arbitration with Winshear seeking compensation in excess of CDN$130M for the loss of its investment in Tanzania (including interest which continues to accrue). In addition, the Winshear is seeking reimbursement of its arbitration costs and fees by Tanzania.
 
A litigation funding facility for US$3.3M is in place with Delta Capital Partners Management ('DELTA'), a firm out of headquartered in Chicago Illinois that specializes in litigation funding. This funding facility covers all legal costs associated with arbitration and is only repayable in the event of a successful award that is recovered from the United Republic of Tanzania.
 
About Winshear Gold Corp.
 
Winshear Gold Corp. is a Canadian-based minerals exploration company advancing the Gaban Gold Project in the Puno region of Peru. Gaban is a possible hard-rock source for the modern-day alluvial gold rush underway in the Madre de Dios basin downstream.
 
The Company is in the process of concluding fully funded arbitration proceedings against the Tanzanian Government to recover its investment and damages for the expropriation of its SMP Gold Project in Tanzania.

[Editor's Note: For real-time gold rates, click widget below or visit KT's dedicated Trading Page here .]

The US dollar was trading near an over one-year low on Tuesday. A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies.

Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer of Zaye Capital Markets, said that when it comes to the price of gold, traders continue to remain very attached to the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance.

'We all know that we are not far from the 2-handle in terms of inflation, and this means that the massive pressure that was on the Fed is no longer there. This means that the Fed doesn't need to be aggressive with its monetary policy, and this also means that there is no strong need for the Fed to hike interest rates any further.

'Although many do believe that there is a possibility of one more rate hike from the Fed, which could bring one final threat to the gold price. But looking at the price action of the precious metal, we think that it is safe to say that there are more bulls than bears in the market,' he said.

Weaker US inflation has seen the more extreme rate-hike bets taken off. Still, the market looks overbought and further gains may be hard-won.

READ MORE: fed making headway as us inflation slows, s&p 500 edges higher

Gold prices have extended gains into Europe's Thursday trading session and remain close to one-month highs as markets digest surprisingly benign official inflation numbers out of the United States in the previous session.

Consumer prices rose by just 0.2% in June, well below expectations, for an annualized gain of 4.8%- the weakest for more than two years. While it's too early to declare the inflation battle won, a weakening trend is now clear. Consequently, investors are having a little rethink as to how high US interest rates might go and not seeing much more than perhaps two more modest rises this year.

Rate futures now predict a quarter-percentage point rise in the Fed Funds Target Rate in July and a 25% chance of one more similar move before year end. That's down from around 35% before the data. The prospects of any more half-point rises seem to have diminished markedly.

The chance of lower-than-expected bond yields aheadhas given non-yielding gold a lift, with its strong gains on weaker inflation giving the lie to the idea that the metal functions as an inflation hedge.

Weakness in the us dollar on the back of the data also gave gold wings. A lower greenback burnishes the charms of Dollar-denominated gold, and gold derivatives, to those holding other currencies.

Spot gold soared more than $30/ounce on Wednesday and remains above $1960 by a whisker in Europe. These are levels last seen in mid-June.

Thursday's market focus will remain on US inflation, and it's likely pass-through effects into Fed policy. There's an official snapshot of producer prices on the slate along with the latest weekly jobless-claim numbers.

Gold Daily Chart

Chart Compiled Using TradingView

Prices have broken sharply above their previous, well respected downtrend channel. They did so on Monday when they crossed above $1928.23, which has now been left far below the market.

The obvious question mark after such a sharp rise is over how sustainable it will be and there the news for gold bulls is probably less good. The metal's Relative Strength Index is heading up to the 60 region which would suggest an overbought market.

Those bulls will need to forge on at least as far as $1989.46, June 1's intraday high, if they're going to nail down this week's rises and bring $2000 back into focus. That looks like a big ask given the lack of likely major trading cues before the end of Friday's global session. With that in mind, the uncommitted may want to see where prices round out the week before stepping back into this market.

Prices are currently well above their 100-day moving average, which comes in at $1952, which now offers support, ahead of the late-June lows around $1892.

It's worth noting that IG's own sentiment data finds the market still extremely bullish, with 62% of traders still coming at it from the long side. It may be that this too suggests that enthusiasm has run too far.

Economists polled by Reuters expect the likely July rate hike to be the Fed's last increase in the current tightening cycle as lowering rates makes the bullion more attractive as it's a non-yielding metal.

Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer, Century Financial, said investors will further keep an eye out for initial jobless claims data on Thursday for the week of July 15, forecast to rise to 242,000 from a seasonally adjusted 237,000.

On the technical front, Valecha said gold prices are in a strong uptrend and are currently testing the $1,980 level.

'The next resistance levels are $2,007 followed by $2,023. On the downside support levels are $1,951 and $1,933,' he said.

Market movements might be vulnerable to data points this week With the Fed in a blackout period, US real yields may play a role

The gold price has paused on its recent run higher as the market takes stock of where the US Dollar is headed. The yellow metal has eased to start the week as the 'big dollar' ticks slightly higher.

Soft inflation data in the US last week saw the market reappraise the extent of tightening that the Federal Reserve will need to carry out in order to contain price pressures.

With CPI and PPI sliding lower, Treasury yields have backed away from their recent peaks.

The benchmark 10-year note he is currently trading near 3.8% after having nudged up against 4.1% just over a week ago. The 2-year bond made a 17-year high earlier this month above 5.1% but it is now back below 4.8%.

The DXY index lost close to 2.25% last week while the gold futures contract only added 1.65%. The index moved to its lowest level since April 2022.

Interest rate markets have placed a high probability of a 25 basis point lift in the overnight target rate when the federal open market committee (FOMC) gather on July 26th.

With the Fed now in a blackout period ahead of its meeting, the data points in the week ahead could drive market volatility.

The market will see a number of business sentiment surveys as well as retail sales, industrial production, housing market statistics and jobs data. The full calendar can be read here.

Something else to keep an eye on might be the US real yield. The inflation-adjusted return from the 10-year part of the curve sometimes has a strong correlation to gold.

The gold price remains in the middle of its 2-month range between 1900 and 2000.

The lower bound of the range could see support lie at the fibonacci retracement levels of the move from 1618 up to 2085. The 38.2% retracement level is at 1907 and the 50% at 1851. The recent low 1900 might also see some support.

Looking at momentum, the price has moved above the 10-, 21-, 34-, 100, 200- and 260-day simple moving averages (sma) .

The 55-day SMA is currently within striking distance of the price at 1972. A clean break above the last remaining daily SMA might see bullish momentum evolve.

The peak of 2000 may offer resistance ahead of a potential resistance zone in the 2060 – 2090 area.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER RATES ON INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices were set on Friday for a third consecutive weekly gain, underpinned by hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes after its July meeting, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was little changed at $1,970.20 per ounce by 0409 GMT, but has gained 0.8 per cent so far this week. On Thursday, the metal slipped from a two-month high as the dollar and bond yields climbed on stronger-than-expected U.S. labour market data.
U.S. gold futures gained 0.1 per cent to $1,972.30.
Gold prices have been supported by expectations that the Fed would increase rates for the last time next week in its current tightening cycle. Most economists polled by Reuters expect a 25-basis point hike at the July 25-26 Fed meeting.
Among other metals, spot silver rose 0.2 per cent to $24.82 per ounce.

It is a highly influential commodity in the global economy, which is likely to face an economic slowdown and recession.

Referring to the latest World Gold Council report, analysts and market experts said continued central demand, event risk hedging and a stable US dollar and interest rates are some of the key factors which pushed the gold prices up in the first half of 2023.

The yellow metal, which rose 5.4 per cent in first half at $1,912 per ounce, not only contributed positive returns to investor portfolio but it also helped dampen volatility throughout the first half, especially during the mini-banking crisis in March when it crossed $2,000 mark after the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.

The precious metal continued the bullish momentum, reaching the peak of $2,067 on May 4 as concerns about the US debt ceiling combined with the US Federal Reserve's signalling a pause of tightening fuelled demand for gold. It also received support from the wider economic pessimism and fears of the upcoming recession.

Central banks' demand for the yellow metal also remained unquenched, contributing an impressive 228 tonnes to global reserves in the first quarter of 2023, according to the World Gold Council, with Singapore, China, and turkey among the biggest buyers.

Gold outlook

Leading banks, rating agencies and consultancies see bright outlook for the precious metal in 2023 and said prices will sustain an upward trend in the second half of the year.

Fitch Solutions expects that gold prices will average $1,950 per ounce this year while ABN Amro Group estimates the precious metal to average at $1,900 per ounce in 2023 and rise to $1,950 by end of 2024.

'March 2023 banking turmoil has triggered a rush to safety among investors fearing recession while market expectations for continued and aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed have now collapsed,' according to Fitch Solutions.

ANZ Research analysts are more bullish and project gold to be trading at around $2,100 by the close of 2023, accelerating to $2,200 by September 2024.

The World Bank's long-term gold price forecast shows that gold prices will finish 2023 at $1,900 and then drop to $1,750 by the end of 2024. Gold prices hovered near a one-month high in mid-July at 1,958.79 per ounce while US gold futures hit $1,963.80.



Shamlal Ahamed, managing director for International Operations at Malabar Gold & Diamonds, said the prevailing gold price during a certain period is governed by a host of socio-economic and political factors across the globe.

'Considering the historic trend in gold prices and market conditions, it is safe to assume that the gold price will only be going up in the near future,' he said.

'Owing to its ever-increasing value, ease of liquidity, tangibility as an asset and ornamental value, the demand for gold both as an asset and jewellery has constantly been on the rise among consumers of all age group, reiterating its status as a safe-haven investment,' he said.

Avoid volatility

To combat the volatility in prices and to provide customers with the best value for their money, he said Malabar Gold & Diamonds has introduced several advance schemes wherein customers can block the prevailing gold rate by paying a portion of the amount set aside for their jewellery purchase.

'If the gold price increases during their purchase, they can avail the blocked rate and if the price drops, they can draw mileage from the reduced rates. Customers can take advantage of the advance facility at any of our outlets or even through our mobile app and it is available 365 days a year,' he said.

Safe haven status

Joy Alukkas, chairman, Joyalukkas Group, said gold prices have historically shown resilience during recessions and market crashes, often acting as a safe haven for buyers.

'Take the example of the 2000 Dotcom Bubble, gold prices began a multi-year bull run. Also, in 2008 the global financial crisis saw gold prices initially decline but subsequently surge to new highs as central banks implemented quantitative easing measures. A similar trend noticed during the Covid -19 crisis,' he said.

'If the recession risk increases in the second half of 2023, gold investment could see greater upside,' he added.

Universal currency

Alukkas said gold is widely considered to be an alternative universal currency, but it does not earn any interest. As a result, it has historically had a negative correlation to interest rates.

'Gold also has a negative correlation historically to the US dollar. Because gold is typically priced in dollars, a weak dollar means gold buyers pay more for the same amount of gold. If the Fed begins to loosen its monetary policies in the second half of the year, the dollar could be pressured further,' he said.

In the first half of the year, Alukkas said gold increased by 5.4 per cent in US dollar - closing June at $1,912.25 per ounce. Referring to the market experts, he said the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate to a 5.25 per cent-5.5 per cent range.

Rising demand

To a question about key factors that will drive gold in second half, he said interest rates and the US dollar weakness will weigh on the gold price.'The main driving factor for gold in the second half is going to be Interest rate decision and weakness in the US dollar. Apart from that inflation, geopolitical and economic uncertainties, central bank policies, production and mining, market sentiment and investor behaviour also affect the price,' he said.

Referring to the World Gold Council, he said gold prices are also driven by basic supply-and-demand dynamics. ""There is plenty of demand for gold. Global gold demand increased 18 per cent in 2022 to 4,741 tonnes,' according to the World Gold Council.

Upside with risks

The council also cautioned that the yellow metal could see greater upside if the global economy faces a serious threat of recession.

'An economic deterioration could be driven by a significant increase in defaults following tighter credit conditions or other unintended consequences of the high-rate environment. Historically, such periods have resulted in higher volatility, significant stock market pullbacks, and overall appetite for high quality, liquid assets such as gold,' it said.

On the flip side, the council said expectations of a soft landing - where a recession is avoided but monetary policy remains tight - could create headwinds for gold and result in disinvestment.'Given gold's positive performance in first half, an investor unwind would need to be severe to result in the average 2023 gold price falling below $1,800 per ounce - its 2022 average,' according to the World Gold Council.

What affects gold price?

The US dollar, physical and investment demand for the precious metal, and the health of the global economy drive gold prices.

How much the gold price up in 2022?

In 2022, the price of gold stayed flat, increasing only slightly by two per cent.

Should I invest in gold?

The outlook for the gold price will depend on the strength of the US dollar and how monetary tightening affects the global economy, as well as developments in the banking industry. Buyers should do their own research to make informed trading decisions, always bearing in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future returns.

Is it a good time to buy gold?

Historical trends indicate that gold tends to surge during the first couple months of the year. The price cools down through the spring and summer, then takes off again in the fall. This means that on a historical basis, the best times to buy gold are early January, March and early April, or mid-June to early July.

Analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to announce a 25 bps rate hike today.

Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said the US dollar rose on Tuesday for the 6th consecutive session, weighing on gold. However, this corrective pullback now highlights gold's internal strength.

'Given the prospects for further declines, a dynamic near $1,947 and $1,910 will be necessary. A break below the former would take gold back below its 50-day moving average, and a break above it could be seen as a false break.

'A break below $1,910 will take the price below the previous local lows. Combined with the lower local highs from mid-July, this would form a downtrend, trashing the current bullish scenario,' said Kuptsikevich.

Manish Jaradi, strategist at dailyFX, said the yellow metal rally appears to be losing steam ahead of the Fed, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan policy meetings.

'The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike interest rates one last time by 25 basis points on Wednesday, but the accompanying statement will be closely watched.

gold 's rally appears to be losing steam ahead of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan policy meetings, raising the risk that the rebound this month is corrective.

The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike interest rates one last time by 25 basis points on Wednesday, but the accompanying statement will be closely watched. A hawkish hike could provide support to the us dollar globally and weigh on gold. A more data-dependent / 'wait-and-watch' could put USD and gold back within their recent ranges, whereas a dovish hike could exert downward pressure on USD, aiding XAU/USD.

In terms of sensitivity of the potential move, if the recent USD performance is anything to go by, a dovish hike by the Fed could weigh on USD more than the other two scenarios.

The European Central Bank is also expected to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis points on Thursday and stay will likely stay hawkish. However, recent comments from ECB officials that a September rate hike is not a done deal raise the risk of a dovish hike. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its ultra-easy monetary policy at its meeting on Friday.

On technical charts,as highlighted in the previous update , XAU/USD has met the price objective of the minor reverse head & shoulders pattern of about 1980 that was triggered earlier this month. However, the yellow metal appears to be succumbing to a tough hurdle at the early-June high of 1983, slightly below the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts.

If the nascent rebound from the end of June were to continue, then XAU/USD needs to stay above converged support, including the mid-July low of 1945 and the 200-period moving average on the 240-minute charts.

A failure to do so would confirm the one-month-long rebound was corrective, exposing downside risks toward the June low of 1893, possibly lower. Retail trader data shows about 69% of traders are net-long gold. The IG Client Sentiment data is typically used as a contrarian indicator to crowd sentiment, suggesting XAU/USD risks further weakness.

Analysts expect that the precious metal may witness volatility as the US Federal Reserve hinted that there could be another rate hike this year after a 25bps hike in rates to a range of 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent on Wednesday night. It was the highest interest rate in 22 years.

'The move was widely expected by market participants given recent projections and comments from various officials, including chairman Jerome Powell during the inter-meeting period,' said Diego Colman, contributing strategist, dailyFX.

Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer, Zaye Capital Markets, said the Fed has nodded in agreement with market expectations, and as a result, a symphony of harmony has resonated in the financial world.

'Like a perfectly orchestrated melody, Fed's synchronised move stroked a chord of confidence among traders, and it is guiding them through the economic crescendo,' he said.

GOLD, SILVER PRICES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices struggled for direction in early Asian trading on Tuesday as traders braced for a widely anticipated rate hike along with monetary policy clues from the U.S. Federal Reserve over the next two days, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold rose 0.2 per cent to $1,958.20 per ounce by 0119 GMT, while U.S. gold futures fell 0.1 per cent to $1,959.90.
The dollar index was at a near-two-week peak, weighing on gold as a stronger dollar makes bullion more expensive for buyers holding other currencies. Notably, gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
Meanwhile, spot silver rose 0.2 per cent to $24.42 per ounce, among other precious metals.

GOLD, SILVER PRICES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices held near two-week lows on Friday after strong U.S. economic data spurred the dollar and bond yields in a high interest rate environment that dragged the non-interest-bearing metal towards its biggest weekly decline in five, news agency Reuters reported.

Spot gold was down 0.21 per cent at $1,959.97 per ounce by 9.34am UAE time.

The precious metal closed July 2.3 per cent higher, the biggest monthly rise in four months on expectations that interest rate hikes were nearing their end.

Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer, Century Financial, said as inflation levels continued to fall, the market participants felt confident that the Federal Reserve along with other central banks were nearing their aggressive monetary policy.

'This provided strong support to the non-yielding metal which found a strong support near the $1,900 level. Data on Friday showed annual US inflation rose at its slowest pace in more than two years in June, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve was closer to ending its fastest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s. Two European Central Bank policymakers on Friday also raised the prospect of an end to the ECB's steepest and longest string of rate rises. Higher interest rates discourage the buying of non-interest-paying bullion, which is priced in dollars,' said Valecha.

This week, the US July jobs report and ISM surveys on manufacturing and services will be scanned to assess the impact of higher borrowing costs on the economy.

Manish Jaradi, Strategist, dailyFX, said interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are keeping a lid on gold.

The us dollar and Treasury fields have found firmer footing amidst the risk aversion Volatility has ticked up a notch. Does it imply a move ahead for XAU/usd ?

The gold price appears poised at a crossroads going into the weekend with the US Dollar firming as Treasury yields tick higher.

An eventful week for markets may still have more to play out with non-farm payrolls data due out later today.

The Fitch downgrade of US sovereign debt credit rating to AA+ from AAA got the ball rolling on Tuesday with a risk-off rout permeating through markets.

The reaction unfolded despite Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen lambasting the move, referring to it as 'arbitrary' and 'outdated'.

Adding to concerns for US debt, on Wednesday, the US Department of Treasury announced that they will seek to issue US$ 103 billion next week, up from the US$ 96 billion last time.

The increasing cost of Treasury borrowing has been most acute in the back end of the yield curve as investors demand more reward for term risk against a deteriorating US government balance sheet over time.

The benchmark 10-year note is surging toward 4.20% for the first time since November last year after dipping to 4.73% a fortnight ago.

In contrast, the short end of the Treasury curve seems more firmly anchored with the market now viewing the Federal Reserve as near the end of its tightening cycle. For 2 weeks the 2-year bond has been trading in a range of 4.85% and 4.95%.

The US Dollar has benefitted throughout this run of risk aversion and the DXY (USD) index has continued to climb off the low seen in the middle of July.

The GVZ index is a measure of implied volatility for gold that is calculated in a similar way to the VIX index's interpretation of volatility for the s&p 500 .

Forward-looking gold volatility has been languishing of late, but it has inched up in the last few trading sessions. This may hint toward some uncertainty within the market and a significant move in price might be in the offing.

Keeping all of this in mind, the yellow metal has held up reasonably well so far, but if these headwinds persist it could be undermined at some point.

chart created in tradingview

The gold price is currently testing trend line support. Should it break lower, support might lie in the 1885 – 1895 area.

In that zone, there are a series of prior lows, a breakpoint, the 200-day simple moving average (sma) and the 38.2% fibonacci retracement level of the move from 1614 up to 2062.

Further down the 50% fibonacci retracement at 1838 might lend support. To learn more about Fibonacci trading, click on the banner below.

On the topside, resistance might be at the recent peak of 1897 or the breakpoint near 2000.

GOLD, SILVER PRICE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices held near three-week lows on Thursday after a larger-than-expected increase in U.S. private payrolls in July fuelled bets on more monetary policy tightening and boosted the dollar and bond yields, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at $1,937.39 by 0400 GMT, trading near its lowest level since July 12 hit in the previous session. U.S. gold futures fell 0.1 per cent to $1,972.90 per ounce.
Non-yielding gold is often sought as a safe investment during times of economic uncertainty but tends to lose its sheen when rates rise.
Spot silver was down 0.2 per cent at $23.67 an ounce, among other precious metals.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER PRICES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold climbed on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar, Treasury yields and Asian stocks stumbled after Fitch downgraded the United States' coveted triple-A credit rating, souring confidence in the economy and shoring up interest in safe-haven bullion, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at $1,946.97 per ounce by 0312 GMT, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.3 per cent to $1,984.
Gold, which is priced in dollars, is a favoured safe-haven investment in times of stress and economic uncertainty. Gold dropped 1 per cent and hit a three-week low on Tuesday as the dollar firmed after a relatively solid data on U.S. manufacturing and construction in June offset a decline in job openings last month.
Higher interest rates raise the cost of holding gold, which yields nothing and needs money to store and insure.
In other metals, spot silver eased 0.2 per cent to $24.29.

The gold price steadied into the Asian session on Wednesday after a selloff into the New York close overnight.
The price action comes after Fitch, a large credit rating agency, downgraded the US sovereign debt credit rating to AA+ from AAA.
The agency 'expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to ‘AA' and ‘AAA' rated peers over the last two decades,'
Ironically in early trade, Treasuries rallied in price and yields dipped as risk aversion appeared to outweigh the implication for US Government borrowing costs.
However, yields had made notable gains in the US session with the benchmark 10-year note trading near 4.06% before dipping below 4% today.
The announcement from Fitch came after the close of the 
Wall Street
 cash session, but futures are moving lower in the aftermath. APAC equities are similarly priced in a soft day ahead.
If the theme of risk aversion continues throughout the day, then gold might see an uptick in volatility.
The GVZ index is a measure of 
implied volatility
 for gold that is calculated in a similar way to the VIX index's interpretation of volatility for the 
S&P 500
. Gold volatility has been languishing and might indicate a lack of conviction for direction in price.

 gyration may also impact the gold price.

GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
The gold price remains near the middle of its almost 5-month range between 1885 and 2062. It also lies close to the 10-, 21-, 34-, 100-day 
simple moving averages (SMA)
 which may imply a lack of directional confidence in the gold market.
The lower bound of the range could see notable support lie in the 1885 – 1895 area.
In that zone, there are a couple of prior lows, a breakpoint, the 200-day SMA and the 38.2% 
Fibonacci Retracement
 level of the move from 1614 up to 2062.
Further down the 50% 
Fibonacci Retracement
 at 1838 might lend support.
On the topside, resistance might be at the recent peak of 1897 or the breakpoint near 2000.

According to Dubai Jewellery Group,"According to Dubai Jewellery Group data, the 24K opened higher at Dh233.75 per gram on Wednesday as compared to last night's close of Dh233.25. While 22K, 21K and 18K were trading at Dh216.5, Dh209.5 and Dh179.5 per gram, respectively, at 9 am UAE time.

Spot gold was up 0.32 per cent at $1,931.64 per ounce by 9.40 am UAE time.

Bas Kooijman, CEO and asset manager of DHF Capital, said gold prices recorded some volatility as markets turned to more caution as traders digested the US credit rating downgrade as well as the economic data in Europe and the US.

'Gold has been on a rebound since the beginning of July but could come under pressure as some uncertainty takes over. The credit rating downgrade has fueled mixed reactions on the market and could push some investors toward safer assets including gold,' he said.

While concerns about a recession in the US have been declining in particular after the Federal Reserve announced it didn't forecast one anymore, traders could continue monitoring economic developments in the US as well as the path of US monetary policy, said Kooijman.

'The time gap until the next monetary policy meeting in the US could leave some room for uncertainty which could impact gold's performance and could fuel volatility. In this regard, gold could be exposed to the downside if traders' expectations move toward more interest rate hikes in the near future,' he added.

Spot gold was steady at $1,917 per ounce by 9.15 am UAE time

Warren Venketas, an analyst at dailyFX, said the yellow metal has been negatively influenced by the recent uptick in risk aversion as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate, while the recent US ratings downgrade followed a similar trend.

'One would naturally expect the yellow metal to find some support as a traditional safe haven asset class but this is yet to develop. Looking back at the prior downgrade, gold managed to benefit and this could be a lagged consequence under current circumstances; however, gold could be in for an upside rally,' he said.

Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer, Zaye Capital, said it seems like the gold price is mostly out of luck.

'Having said this, from a technical price point, the price has started to look a bit oversold now,' he said.

Most recently, XAU/usd has fallen below key support, accentuating downside risks. What are the key levels to watch in XAU/USD?

Higher real rates could be starting to finally weigh on gold prices . Real yields have been elevated on rising nominal interest rates, moderating price pressures/inflation expectations amid the growing perception of the 'higher-for-longer-rates' theme.

In contrast, gold has stayed broadly in a range, widening the gap with real yields. Gold is a non-interest, non-coupon-bearing asset, and positive real yields tend to increase the opportunity cost of holding the zero-yielding yellow metal.

receive timely and compelling market commentary from the dailyfx team

The gold price continues to languish going into Tuesday's trading session as the us dollar pursues higher ground, assisted by rising Treasury yields.

The metals complex is generally weaker across the board, impeded by the stronger Dollar and deteriorating appetite for risk and growth -orientated assets.

Industrial metals have been hit harder than the yellow metal with the outlook for China facing increased scrutiny.

Generally weaker economic data there last week has been compounded by property groups Country Garden and Ocean Sino missing debt payments.

Country Garden defaulted on US Dollar coupon payments last week and this week saw trading in its onshore debt suspended alongside Ocean Sino.

The market is awaiting concrete action from authorities to deal with the economic uncertainty.

A plethora of Chinese data will be closely inspected for further clues on the state of the world's second-largest economy. The details can be viewed here.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) fixed the Yuan weaker today at 7.1768 per USD. The bank also cut the medium-term lending facility rate to 2.50% from 2.65%.

While that is unfolding, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is surging above 4.20% for the first time since November last year after dipping to 4.73% a month ago.

The Treasury curve seems more firmly anchored with the market now viewing the Federal Reserve as near the end of its tightening cycle.

The 2-year bond is nearing 5.0%, still some way from the peak of 5.11% seen last month.

This appears to have underpinned the DXY (USD) index. At the same time, forward-looking gold volatility has been languishing of late, but it has inched up in the last few trading sessions. This may hint toward some uncertainty within the market and a significant move in price might be in the offing.

The GVZ index is a measure of implied volatility for gold that is calculated in a similar way to the VIX index's interpretation of volatility for the s&p 500 .

Looking ahead, the precious metal has held up reasonably well given the state of play, but if these headwinds persist it could be further undermined.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER RATES ON INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold prices stalled on Wednesday, a day after breaching the key $1,900 support level for the first time in 1-1/2 months as U.S. Treasury yields were boosted on expectations the Federal Reserve is not yet finished with its rapid monetary tightening cycle, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold held its ground at $1,903.70 per ounce by 0317 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,935.40.
Gold on Tuesday dropped to as low as $1,895.50 an ounce, its weakest level since end-June, as benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit an almost 10-month high, making them more attractive than non-interest-bearing bullion.
""Gold prices continue to struggle with the relentless rise in real yields lately, along with strength in the U.S. dollar, which seems to be reducing gold's appeal and driving some shunning among investors,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG.

However, it is unlikely for major rallies due to uncertainties overrate hikes and the performance ofassets, he said.

'Investors can cautiously increase their exposure to gold as prices corrected about 5 percent from their all-time highs and the key demand season is nearing, which may increase the demand and tthe price of the metal. In addition, a weak Indian Rupee also offers additional support to the yellow metal,"" he said.

Jateen Trivedi, VP Research analyst at LKP Securities, said given the ongoing trend of global central banks acquiring gold and the uncertain global economic landscape, gold prices are anticipated to remain steady, if not rise significantly due to the impact of a stronger dollar and elevated interest rates. However, the trajectory could swiftly change. The moment the Federal Reserve hints at a potential pause in its rate hikes or even the possibility of an interest rate cut, gold prices are likely to surge.

Taking these factors into account, investors can reasonably project an optimistic outlook for gold, foreseeing price levels in the range of Rs 61,000 to Rs 62,000 (per 10 gm) by the close of the year. It's a strategic move that aligns with both the weakening rupee and the traditional buoyancy of the festive season in India. For investors seeking to accumulate gold, a strategic entry point lies between the current levels of Rs 58,500 and Rs 57,000, he said.

The yellow metal slipped from a two-and-a-half-week high on Friday. It could be the first week of gains this month.

Investors will foon Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's speeches expected later in the day at the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for further clues about interest rates.

Rania Gule, market analyst at XS.com, said gold has been rising this week as yields recede. However, with expectations of a prolonged period of higher federal interest rates, the short-term likelihood of an upward trend in gold seems limited.

'The rise in risk-free interest rates, such asTreasury bonds, poses a significant challenge to interest-free assets like gold. Traders can obtain a rising 'risk-free' yield, making the case for keeping interest rates high over an extended period a downward pressure on gold. The current strong negative correlation between gold and yields has been evident in the recent decline in the 10-year bond yields, curbing the strength of the gold rally,' said Gule.

Global economies are struggling, according to the latest round of PMI releases, with a raft of G7 countries seeing their manufacturing and services sectors contracting sharply. The euro Zone composite index fell to 47.0, a 33-month low, the UK composite index slumped to 47.9, a 31-month nadir, while the comparableindex slipped to 50.4, the lowest level in six months. A reading below 50 suggests economic contraction . Financial markets downgraded future interest rate hikes across the market after these releases, sending government bond yields spinning lower.

They remain heavy though after three days of declines The $1900 level is in play and its fate will probably be key

Gold prices recovered a little on Thursday following three days of falls this week, but the market remains beset by relentless rises in high-quality bond yields, notably in the United States but also elsewhere, as markets move to price in higher interest rates for longer.

The previous session saw the release of minutes from the US Federal Reserve's July monetary policy meeting at which 'most participants' reportedly still saw considerable upside risks to inflation, of the order which may warrant more interest rate hikes.

The minutes helped ten-year Treasury yields test the 4.3% level, their highest for more than fifteen years.

Gold tends to do much better in times of low or negative interest rates when small yields on offer elsewhere serve to gloss over the complete lack of yield inherent in holding the metal. Those days are clearly long gone, and the jury remains out as to if, or when, they might come back.

Moreover, the stronger Dollar those yields inevitably bring also hits gold, making gold products denominated in the US currency more expensive for buyers elsewhere.

Given that it's perhaps unsurprising that gold prices should have been fading consistently for the past three months. And there wasn't any data respite for them on Thursday. US jobless claims fell last week, underlining the tightness in the labor market which so concerns the Fed. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index surged to its first positive reading since August last year.

With those two releases, the main economic events of this week are now behind us, with little left on the data docket likely to offer gold much in the way of trading opportunities. There are inflation snapshots from both Japan and the Eurozone on tap Friday, but they're not likely to produce long-lasting moves.

Gold Prices Technical Analysis

Gold Prices Daily Chart Compiled Using TradingView

While the fundamental picture looks likely to remain gloomy for the metal, bulls seem keen to put up a fight before they'll abandon the psychologically important $1900/ounce level to which they're currently clinging, having recovered it in Thursday's early trade.

It will be instructive to see whether they can hold that level into the week's end. There's a band of support between the 200-day moving average at $1,904 and June's low at $1,893, which seems to be holding sellers in check now.

However prices have broken below their uptrend line from last November with their slide below $1922.52 back on August 9 and are now falling toward the base of the uptrend channel in place from May 4's fourteen-month highs.

That provides support at $1844.69, ahead of March 9's low at $1811.50.

The current setup hardly looks likely to produce a durable price rise, and in the short term at least gains seem likely to be extremely fragile. Still, there could be a sense in which prices have suffered enough for the short term, with the Relative Strength Index just a few ticks above the seriously oversold 30 level, at or about 34.

gold's longer-term downtrend remains intact despite recent reprieve

gold remains within the descending channel but has found support ahead of $1875, turning higher this week as rising yields ease. with the fed funds rate anticipated to remain elevated for longer, gold's upside potential appears short-lived.

real interest rates rise above 2%, denting gold's appeal

rising risk-free rates like us treasuries, poses a challenge for the non-interest-bearing metal as traders can get a 'risk-free' rate of return that is on the rise. as such this has placed downward pressure on gold until this morning's drop on the 10-year yield in particular. gold has shown a strong negative correlation to us yields, as would be expected, and therefore we are seeing a short-term dip in the metal.

gold's bullish lift appears unconvincing

the daily chart shows that the precious metal is on track to post a third day of gains but technical indications raise doubts around an extended move higher. the recent lift in gold appears labored as upper wicks can be seen on the previous four daily candles, indicating a rejection of higher prices before each daily close. generally speaking, countertrend moves require volatility and subsequent momentum to reverse near-term direction and the atr indicator (brown line) below shows a steady decline in volatility.

the initial challenge to a potential bullish reversal appears at the $1915 level with $1937 warranting a reassessment of the medium-term bearish trend. however, a lack of bullish follow-through, lower volatility, and a very strong negative correlation to the elevated us 10-year yield (correlation coefficient nearing -1), gold maintains its bearish outlook.

levels to the downside include the swing low at $1885, with the longer-term level of significance being $1875 for continued downside. risks to the current gold outlook may arise later this week if jerome powell signals a more dovish path on interest rates but thus far has been careful not to give too much away given the unpredictable nature of inflation.

The moment the US Federal Reserve hints at a potential pause in its rate hikes or even the possibility of an interest rate cut, gold prices are likely to surge, the analyst said.

With the rupee showing signs of weakness against the dollar and the festive season in India just around the corner, investors should consider capitalising on the positive trend in gold.

The robust festive demand in India is poised to maintain a stable gold price. For investors seeking to accumulate gold, a strategic entry point lies between the current levels of Rs 58,500 and Rs 57,000 (per 10 gm), the analyst said.

Taking these factors into account, investors can reasonably project an optimistic outlook for gold, foreseeing price levels in the range of Rs 61,000 to Rs 62,000 by the close of the year. It's a strategic move that aligns with both the weakening rupee and the traditional buoyancy of the festive season in India, Trivedi said.

receive timely and compelling market commentary from the dailyfx team

The gold price is under the pump again going into Friday's trading session with the US Dollar continuing to be underpinned by rising Treasury yields.

The DXY (USD) index traded at its highest level since early June overnight while spot gold traded at its lowest level since March after touching US$ 1885 oz.

The surge in Treasury yields saw the benchmark 10-year bond trade at 4.328% in the North American session. That was just a fraction below the 4.335% seen in October last year, which was the highest return on that note since 2007.

Potentially driving the Dollar higher could be the deterioration in the Chinese Yuan. The recent data on Treasury holdings revealed that China were again sellers of the bonds through June.

They have sold every month this year, except for March, a month that saw the Yuan rally significantly.

The domestic situation is presenting some challenges for authorities there, after Country Garden and Sino Ocean, two very large property developers, defaulted on several offshore and onshore bonds this month.

There are concerns that the situation in the property market might have further ramifications after Zhongrong International Trust Co., a major player in China's trust sector, missed several obligations to its clients over the past week.

Then on Thursday, Evergrande, another large Chinese property company, filed for Chapter 15 protection in the US. Chapter 15 is similar to filing for Chapter 11, but for companies that have offshore interests as well as a US business.

Financial markets have historically exhibited nervousness if the concept of contagion becomes apparent.

Gold is sometimes seen as somewhat of a 'haven' in such circumstances but that has not been the case in this latest episode of markets schism. Treasuries are also seen as a risk-free asset and are sometimes sought after in times of upheaval.

Both of these assets have been moving lower in price and it might be the dynamic coming out of China that could be driving the price action.

With Treasury yields climbing, which sees the capital value slide lower, it could see investors avoid the non-yield bearing yellow metal.

The GVZ index is a measure of implied volatility for gold that is calculated in a similar way to the VIX index's interpretation of volatility for the s&p 500 .

This forward-looking gold volatility index has been languishing of late, but it has been ticking higher this week. This might indicate building uncertainty within the market and a significant move in price might be in the offing.

If the situation in China continues to unravel, authorities there might need more USD to sell to support the Yuan. This could see more interest for the Dollar in other markets, including XAU/USD. To learn more about how to trade gold, click on the banner below.

treasury yields are on the march higher as selling in debt markets continues vigorous us real yields might be ominous. will they drive xau/usd under support?

the gold price is oscillating around us$ 1,900 in the spot market going into wednesday's trading session as markets lie in wait for the federal reserve's jackson hole economic symposium to get underway on thursday.

the precious metal has held up reasonably well considering the recent surge in treasury yields. yesterday, the benchmark 10-year note traded at its highest yield since 2007, eclipsing 4.36% after dipping to 3.57% in june.

perhaps of more concern for gold bulls is the uptick in us real yields. the real yield is the nominal yield less the market-priced inflation rate derived from treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) for the same tenor. this inflation rate is known as the breakeven inflation rate.

the breakeven rate has been relatively stable over the past month, and this has allowed the real yield to climb. this has potentially undermined the gold price as it does not offer investors and traders a return. in fact, there is a cost of carry for holding the yellow metal.

this brings the focus on nominal treasury into focus and the outcome from jackson hole might be crucial for the gold price going forward.

the us 10-year real yield traded above 2% on tuesday, a level not seen since july 2009 when the gold price was around us$ 925.

the subsequent collapse in the real through to 2013, saw it go negative to almost -1%.

it was while that move lower was happening in the us real yields that gold roared to it peak of us$ 1,920 in 2011. if real yields continue to blitz higher, the gold price may come under pressure. see the second chart below.

looking ahead for this week, while there be many fed speakers will be crossing the wires once the symposium gets underway on thursday. however, the markets are likely to be more finely tuned to fed chair jerome powell's speech on friday.

the gold price recently tested a potential support zone in the 1885 – 1895 area.

in that zone, there are a series of prior lows, a breakpoint, and the 38.2% fibonacci retracement level of the move from 1614 up to 2062.

further down the 50% fibonacci retracement at 1838 might lend support.

on the topside, resistance might be at the recent peak of 1897 or psychological level at 2000 where there is also the breakpoint nearby.

As an investment asset, gol","(MENAFN- EyesOnSOlution)

Gold has long been a valuable and sought-after precious metal, revered for its beauty and used as a store of value. As an investment asset, gold prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties. However, another critical aspect that impacts the gold market is the cost of gold mining. In this article, we will explore the relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices, their dynamics, and the implications for investors and the mining industry.

Gold Mining Costs

Gold mining is a complex and capital-intensive process that involves various stages, including exploration, mine development, extraction, processing, and refining. Each stage incurs costs that contribute to the overall cost of mining gold. Some of the primary cost components in gold mining include:

1. Exploration and Development: Identifying and assessing potential gold deposits require extensive exploration efforts. This involves costs associated with geology, geophysics, drilling, and feasibility studies. Once a viable deposit is discovered, the development phase involves constructing mine infrastructure, such as roads, tunnels, and processing facilities.

2. Extraction and Processing: Extracting gold from the earth involves mining operations, which can be either open-pit or underground, depending on the deposit's characteristics. Mining costs include expenses related to labor, equipment, fuel, explosives, and maintenance. Additionally, processing the ore to extract the gold involves crushing, grinding, and chemical processes, which incur further costs.

3. General and Administrative Expenses: Running a mining operation requires a range of general and administrative costs, including personnel salaries, regulatory compliance, insurance, legal fees, and community relations.

4. Environmental and Regulatory Compliance: Gold mining is subject to environmental regulations and compliance requirements. Meeting these standards entails costs associated with environmental impact assessments, reclamation efforts, and ensuring adherence to safety and health regulations.

Gold Prices

Gold trading prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including supply and demand dynamics, macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment, and geopolitical events. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset, meaning its demand tends to increase during times of economic uncertainty or financial market volatility.

Factors influencing gold prices include:

1. Economic Conditions: Gold prices can be influenced by macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, interest rates, and currency movements. During periods of economic instability or inflationary pressures, investors may flock to gold as a hedge against currency depreciation and to preserve their wealth.

2. Central Bank Policies: Actions taken by central banks, such as monetary easing or tightening, can impact gold prices. Lower interest rates and expansionary monetary policies tend to support higher gold prices, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.

3. Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical events, such as conflicts, trade disputes, or political instability, can create uncertainties in financial markets and drive investors towards safe-haven assets like gold. These events can increase gold demand and subsequently influence its price.

4. Investor Sentiment: Market sentiment and investor behavior play a significant role in gold price movements. Perceptions about the overall health of the economy, financial market conditions, and risk appetite can drive speculative buying or selling of gold, impacting its price.

Relationship Between Gold Mining Costs and Gold Prices

The relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices is complex and interconnected. Understanding this relationship is crucial for investors, mining companies, and industry analysts. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Cost of Production: Gold mining costs determine the breakeven price at which mining companies can operate profitably. If gold prices fall below the cost of production, mining companies may curtail or suspend operations, leading to a potential decrease in supply. Conversely, when gold prices rise above the cost of production, mining companies are incentivized to increase production, potentially leading to an increase in supply.

2. Profit Margins: The profitability of gold mining companies is closely tied to the margin between gold prices and production costs. Higher gold prices relative to mining costs can result in increased profit margins for mining companies, attracting investment, and potentially driving up production. Conversely, declining gold prices or rising mining costs can compress profit margins, leading to reduced production or even mine closures.

3. Supply and Demand Dynamics: The relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices affects the overall supply and demand dynamics in the gold market. Higher gold prices can incentivize increased production and exploration activities, potentially leading to higher supply. Conversely, if gold prices remain low for an extended period, mining companies may reduce exploration efforts and capital expenditures, potentially impacting future supply.

4. Investment Demand: Gold prices can be influenced by investment demand, which is driven by factors such as investor sentiment, economic conditions, and geopolitical risks. If investment demand for gold increases, it can drive up gold prices, providing a positive environment for mining companies to profitably operate and potentially expand production.

Implications for Investors and the Mining Industry

The relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices has significant implications for investors and the mining industry as a whole:

1. For Investors:

- Understanding the relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices can help investors make more informed decisions about their gold investments. They can evaluate the profitability of mining companies by analyzing their production costs relative to prevailing gold prices.

- Investors can monitor the cost trends in the mining industry to assess the potential impact on future gold supply and its implications for prices.

- Recognizing the dynamics between gold prices and mining costs can help investors identify potential investment opportunities during periods of mispricing or imbalance.

2. For Mining Companies:

- Mining companies need to carefully manage their production costs to ensure profitability and sustainability. They must constantly assess and optimize their operations to mitigate the impact of cost fluctuations on their bottom line.

- Efficient cost management and productivity improvements can help mining companies remain competitive, even during periods of low gold prices.

- Mining companies might adjust their production plans and exploration budgets based on the prevailing gold price environment. Higher gold prices can incentivize increased investment in exploration and development activities.

3. For Industry Analysts:

- Analysts and researchers studying the gold market can use the relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices as an important factor in forecasting future supply and identifying potential price trends.

- Analyzing cost trends in the mining industry can provide insights into the overall health and profitability of the sector, helping analysts assess the investment potential of mining companies.

- Understanding the dynamics between gold prices and mining costs can contribute to more accurate economic models and forecasts related to the gold market.

Conclusion

The relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices is intricate and multifaceted. Gold mining costs encompass various expenses associated with exploration, extraction, processing, and administrative functions. Gold prices, on the other hand, are influenced by factors such as economic conditions, central bank policies, geopolitical risks, and investor sentiment.

Recognizing the interplay between gold mining costs and gold prices is crucial for investors, mining companies, and industry analysts. Understanding this relationship can help investors make informed decisions, mining companies manage their operations effectively, and analysts assess the overall health and trends in the gold market.

By monitoring the cost dynamics in the mining industry and staying informed about the factors impacting gold prices, stakeholders can navigate the gold market more effectively and potentially capitalize on investment opportunities. Whether as a safe-haven asset, a portfolio diversifier, or a long-term store of value, gold continues to play a significant role in the global financial landscape, making it essential to comprehend the intricate relationship between gold mining costs and gold prices.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/07/pr_15988_b6a3c3f3_image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,13.312901,c966c97fd3b38b6a457d591089989b40

Higher than expected US inflation data has fueled more uncertainty about the direction of monetary policy. While the Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain interest rates unchanged in next week's meeting, elevated inflationary pressures could leave some concerns about another hike this year.

The potential for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high for longer could continue to weigh on gold prices which have been declining since their peak in May this year. Current market sentiment could continue pushing traders toward bonds. Yields on both the 2-year and the 10-year treasury bonds remain near this year's high despite some fluctuation during the last few days.

During the previtwo months gold ETFs witnessed outflows, however during the recent weeks some inflows started trickling in that have helped the yellow metal.

The movement in gold is inextricably intertwined with two fundamental factors, the trajectory ofinterest rates, and the direction of theDollar.

The currency outlook has been positive owing to the north-bound interest rate outlook.

Gold gained ground based on the uncertainties around theeconomic performance and the possibility of the economy degrowing substantially, but these uncertainties turned out to be false alarms as thejobless claims data beat analyst expectations.

However, the major concern among traders is the economic sluggishness and the magnitude at which is happening in some of the developed countries is not likely to push gold demand higher, the report said.

The last address of theFederal Reserve Chairman states in no unclear terms the need to hike rates to control inflation, and he acknowledges the probability of below-trend growth in the short term due to interest rate actions.

Multiple factors have accorded gold a place in investor portfolios in the last three to five years. These include geopolitical developments, interest rates, economic growth prospects, the need to diversify portfolios, the rising price level, etc.

At this juncture, inflation continues to be the singular factor that is supporting gold prices apart from the generally weak global economic outlook, the report said.

More than this, the very hawkish stance of theFederal Reserve is a matter of concern, as the central banl has already reaffirmed its commitment to keeping its inflation target of 2 per cent intact, and it will not rest until the goal is reached.

The end result is that rather than inflation and uncertainties which could have given Gold an edge but the Fed's fight against inflation has assumed greater importance after the Jackson Hole meet which will see gold trading in a narrow range in the near term, the report said.

Rising Treasury yields appear to be driving real yields ahead ofCPI A miss in CPI forecasts might have implications for real yields and XAU/USD

The gold price dipped going into Wednesday's trading session with theDollar consolidating after Monday's rout and ahead ofCPI later today.

Undermining the precimetal is the continual climb ofreal yields. When we step back and look at the bigger picture, the ascent of real yields might appear to be one-way traffic for now.

If today'sCPI figure falls short of expectations, it might see long-term inflation expectations dip, adding to real yields.

If today'sCPI figure beats estimates, it could add to worries of a tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve at next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

This could lead to the back end of the Treasury yield curve backing up, potentially underpinning real yields, particularly around the closely watched 10-year part of the curve.

A Bloomberg survey of economists is looking for headline CPI to print at 3.6% year-on-year to the end of August and 4.3% for the core reading.

Looking at the chart below, energy appears to be a notable contributing factor to CPI. Crude oil was little changed through August but it has rallied significantly in September.

The real yield is the nominal yield less the market-priced inflation rate derived from Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) for the same tenor.

It is looked at by markets as the true return of an investment as it allows for the time value of money that is impacted by price changes through inflation or deflation.

When we strip out the components of the real return, it is apparent that nominal yields have been driving real yields higher with the market-priced inflation expectations steady near 2.3%. That is slightly above the Fed's CPI target of 2%.

The last time that real yields were this high was 2009 when spot gold was below US$ 1,000. More recently in 2018, when the real yield was near 1.0%, spot gold was under US$ 1,300 an ounce.

GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS SNAPSHOT

The gold price appears to be ensconced in the range for now, having traded between 1885 and 1897 for six months.

Support could be in the 1885 – 1895 area where there are a series of prior lows, a breakpoint, and the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level of the move from 1614 up to 2062.

Further down the 50% Fibonacci Retracement at 1838 might lend support.

On the topside, resistance might be at the recent peaks of 1953 and 1897 or the spsychological level of 2000 where there is also the breakpoint nearby.

The prices fell as the US dollar and bond yields powered higher after the Federal Reserve signalled another rate hike this year and a tighter monetary policy through 2024 than previously expected.

In Dubai, the 24K was trading at Dh233.5 per gram on Thursday morning, down from Dh235.0 at the close of the markets on Wednesday. Similarly, 22K, 21K and 18K also opened lower at Dh216.25, Dh209.25 and Dh179.25 per gram, respectively.

Spot gold slid to $1,928.13 per ounce by 9.15 am UAE time

Spot gold prices on Wednesday hit their highest since September 1 before the US Fed revised its economic projections with higher-for-longer rate warnings.

Daniel Dubrovsky, contributing senior strategist, dailyFX, said gold prices turned lower in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve monetary policy announcement as Jerome Powell basically alluded to a 'higher for longer' approach, causing financial markets to price in a higher terminal Federal Funds rate and pushing back expectations of rate cuts further down the time horizon.

'In response, Treasury yields and the dollar rose, working together to pressure precious metals, like gold and silver, lower,' he said.

The Dubai Jewellery Group data showed 24K trading at Dh220.75 per gram on Wednesday morning as compared to last night's close of Dh221.5 per gram. Similarly, the other variants also opened lower. The 22K, 21K and 18K were trading at Dh204.5, Dh198.0 and Dh169.75 per gram, respectively.

Spot gold eased 0.1 per cent to $1,821.97 per ounce by 9.25am UAE time.

Prices fell for a seventh consecutive session on Tuesday to touch their lowest levels since March at $1,813.90, as the US dollar strengthened on data showing US job openings unexpectedly increased in August.

The unexpected rise in August US job openings highlights the durability of labour demand, NAB Resources said, adding that gold continues to decline on the higher-for-longer Federal Reserve rates outlook, strengthening U.S. bond yields and the dollar.

Daniel Dubrovsky, contributing senior strategist at dailyFX, said over the past 2 weeks, gold prices have sunk about 5.3 per cent.

'This is setting the stage for the worst 10-day period for the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index since early July. In response, retail traders continue to increase their bullish exposure in the yellow metal,' he said.

The Dubai Jewellery Group data showed 24K trading at Dh220.5 per gram on Tuesday at 9am as compared to last night's close of Dh222.25 per gram. While 22K, 21K and 18K opened lower at Dh204.25, Dh197.5 and Dh169.25 per gram, respectively.

Spot gold was down 0.3 per cent to $1,820.17 per ounce as of 9.25 am UAE time.

The yellow metal was pressured as US Federal Reserve officials underscored the likelihood of interest rates staying high.

Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said gold's sell-off looked like a capitulation of the bulls, with a break of multi-month support.

'This could soon be followed by increased volatility with new lows. It is often at times like this that market inflexion points are formed,' he said

Kuptsikevich added that gold in the short term is oversold, creating the potential for a corrective bounce.

'It may well be that this acceleration in gold's decline is a sign that the fall is nearing its end, but it is still a case where it is better to be a little late to the rally than to buy in,' he added.

Child says that around ten companies are currently under NDA with access to Condor's data room, but that the sales process is taking ""slightly longer"" than the company anticipated but there is a ""revolving door"" of interest in the mine.

He lays out the investment case, highlighting that Condor has meticulously de-risked the project and owns 100% of assets, making it an attractive proposition. Regarding the valuation of the mine, Child says that company Chairman Jim Mellon, who holds a significant stake, has made it absolutely clear that he is determined to secure ""a fair price"".

He also says that while the company has plans in place for all kinds of contingencies, the main objective is selling the assets as Condor isn't geared for in-house mining operations.

Express News Service

BENGALURU: Gold prices have been skyrocketing ever since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began in West Asia. This is happening ahead of the festive season in India — Dasara in October and Deepavali in November — when more people buy gold as these months are considered auspicious.

The gold price, which is Rs 58,680 for 10gm (24 carat), is likely to touch Rs 70,000 soon. Likewise, the price of 22 carat gold, which has now crossed Rs 53,000 for 10gm, might go up to Rs 60,000 in the coming days. 'Any war will have an impact on gold prices. We are expecting this to last for a few weeks. This apart, the interest rate hike in the US also pushed the prices of yellow metal up,' according to TA Saravana, president of Karnataka Gold Jewelers' Association.

CA Surendra Mehta, national secretary of India Bullion and Jewellers' Association, attributed the increasing prices of gold to the conflict in West Asia. In fact, gold prices, which saw a downward trend a few days ago, started shooting up with the conflict in West Asia continuing, he said.

He said whenever there is geopolitical trouble or trade tension, investors prefer to invest in gold as the equity market will be down. Gold is the only commodity whose prices remain stable despite economic upheavals, and with a speculation, investors invest in the yellow metal.

‘When conflicts begin, people invest in gold'

KS Keshav, professor of Economics, Bangalore University, said whenever wars or conflicts begin, people usually invest in gold. This has been a worldwide trend. If the war escalates, it will impact the stock market which might crash. But this is not true in the case of gold. 'Now with this trend, the demand for gold is increasing. When the demand for the yellow metal is not met, naturally its prices tend to go up globally,' he added.

Prof Keshav said when the Ukraine-Russia war started, a similar trend prevailed. People anticipated that this war would continue for many days and started investing in gold. 'However, this trend witnessed a decline to some extent, but the war did not stop,' he added.

Economist RS Deshpande, former director, Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC), said gold prices go up drastically, but they will come down. 'But when the prices come down, they will not return to their original prices. Usually, they will be slightly above the earlier (older) prices,' he said.





BENGALURU: Gold prices have been skyrocketing ever since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began in West Asia. This is happening ahead of the festive season in India — Dasara in October and Deepavali in November — when more people buy gold as these months are considered auspicious. The gold price, which is Rs 58,680 for 10gm (24 carat), is likely to touch Rs 70,000 soon. Likewise, the price of 22 carat gold, which has now crossed Rs 53,000 for 10gm, might go up to Rs 60,000 in the coming days. 'Any war will have an impact on gold prices. We are expecting this to last for a few weeks. This apart, the interest rate hike in the US also pushed the prices of yellow metal up,' according to TA Saravana, president of Karnataka Gold Jewelers' Association. CA Surendra Mehta, national secretary of India Bullion and Jewellers' Association, attributed the increasing prices of gold to the conflict in West Asia. In fact, gold prices, which saw a downward trend a few days ago, started shooting up with the conflict in West Asia continuing, he said.googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); He said whenever there is geopolitical trouble or trade tension, investors prefer to invest in gold as the equity market will be down. Gold is the only commodity whose prices remain stable despite economic upheavals, and with a speculation, investors invest in the yellow metal. ‘When conflicts begin, people invest in gold' KS Keshav, professor of Economics, Bangalore University, said whenever wars or conflicts begin, people usually invest in gold. This has been a worldwide trend. If the war escalates, it will impact the stock market which might crash. But this is not true in the case of gold. 'Now with this trend, the demand for gold is increasing. When the demand for the yellow metal is not met, naturally its prices tend to go up globally,' he added. Prof Keshav said when the Ukraine-Russia war started, a similar trend prevailed. People anticipated that this war would continue for many days and started investing in gold. 'However, this trend witnessed a decline to some extent, but the war did not stop,' he added.

The key monthly Producer Price I,"(MENAFN- Investor Ideas) Gold Price (XAU/USD) Maintains Gains Despite Higher-than-Expected Producer Price Index (PPI) Figures for September. The key monthly Producer Price Index rose at a higher rate of 0.5% compared to the expected 0.4%, and the core Producer Price Index expanded at a faster pace of 0.3% compared to the expectations and the previous reading of 0.2%. On an annual basis, the core Producer Price Index increased to 2.2%, exceeding expectations of 1.6% and the previous reading of 2%. Prices of basic goods and services also surged to 2.7%, indicating the strength of the U.S. economy and the possibility of renewed inflation, supporting the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening and the dollar's interest.

However, gold continued to rise during Wednesday's trading, as Federal officials continue to favor keeping interest rates steady in the 5.25% to 5.50% range until the end of the year. Gold also benefits from the escalating conflict in Palestine, which may extend beyond Gaza. Investors should be prepared for fluctuations in the price of gold in the near and distant future, as the minutes of the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and inflation data for the same month are set to be released.

It's worth noting that Federal officials support maintaining interest rates unchanged due to the rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields to multi-year highs. FOMC members expect higher bond yields to be offset by further interest rate hikes, which may slow down spending and investment due to rising borrowing costs.

Gold prices seem to be rising near their weekly high of $1870 despite the significantly unexpected Producer Price Index report. This may raise the likelihood of an interest rate hike in the November Federal Reserve policy meeting. I expect gold prices to remain volatile as the FOMC meeting minutes are released today, with markets monitoring inflation expectations and interest rates.

Regarding U.S. producer inflation, the key monthly Producer Price Index is expected to expand at a slower rate of 0.4% compared to the 0.7% recorded in August, while the core Producer Price Index is expected to rise at a steady rate of 0.2% in the same period. On an annual basis, the core Producer Price Index is expected to remain stable at 1.6%.

However, I believe that gold prices may remain high for some time amid the conflict in Palestine. The appeal of gold as a haven remains high amid risk aversion, increasing demand for safe-haven assets. In addition to the high demand for safe-haven assets, the Fed officials' neutral interest rate statements may keep gold on an upward trajectory.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has seen a five-day losing streak and has settled below 106.00 points amid improved market sentiment and expectations of further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve for the remainder of 2023. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is poised for a potential recovery after a deep correction, with data showing the U.S. economy's resilience amid current labor market conditions and strong consumer spending. I expect the global economy to face more crises and disasters due to tensions in Palestine. Investors will also focus on inflation data for September, which will determine the basis of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy for November.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,10.078682,b329de1cd4a7bc2db5e3359dd62a2c3a

The yield on the 30-year US Treasury bond pierced five per cent last week for the first time since 2007, while the prospect of ultra-high interest rates being sustained over the winter and into new year has also weighed down bullion prices.

The possibility of a further interest rate hike has also grown following a robust US jobs data report last week, with the US Labor Department's data showing a 336,000 increase in jobs in September on a monthly basis, beating industry expectations of around 170,000 new roles opening up in the economy.

Meanwhile, the strengthening of the dollar compared to rival currencies has hampered commodities, including even oil during its historic rally last month.

Prices have dropped over $100 per ounce since last month, nosediving from $1,926.25 per ounce on 25 September to $1,812.65 per ounce on 6 October.

Since then there has been a slight recovery, with gold prices climbing back to $1.832.98 per ounce, but prices remain on track for a second straight weekly loss.

Carlo Alberto De Casa, external market analyst at Kinesis Money, argued that the latest drop in prices shows that gold remains trapped in a'bearish scenario', weighed down by challenging macroeconomic conditions.

'This confirms the high pressure that the precious metals markets are experiencing in the current scenario, with rising yields and a strong dollar,' he said.

Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at Commerzbank, said there was a possibility of further price declines amid sell-offs from speculative investors, with contracts for long positions having declined to lows posted during August's previous slump.

He said:'It is perfectly possible therefore that they will dip below this level. The last time speculative positioning in gold was net short – which is not seen very often – was in November 2022.'",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/08/A_a1bc5image_story.png,False,@menafn,9.357461,61440e34cb353a5782e44c2153811f86

BEIJING -- Liu Jie, a resident of Beijing, received a gold bean from her friend as a 30th-birthday gift recently.
 
""I asked my best friend to buy me a gold bean for my birthday,"" Liu said. ""It's a kind of investment. Gold is a safe store of value and can be easily recycled.""
 
Like Liu, many Chinese people have an increasing appetite for the safe-haven asset, whether in the form of gold bars, coins, necklaces, bracelets or beans. The pill-like bling, which only weighs approximately one gram, has become a fashionable choice for Chinese gold hoarders.
 
Bolstered by the strong demand, the RMB-denominated gold price has generally remained bullish this year, growing by 11 percent from the start of 2023.
 
The latest data from the Shanghai Gold Exchange shows that the price for gold that is 99.99 percent pure or above closed at 466 yuan ($64.9) per gram on Wednesday, sustaining the recent recovery.
 
At the Shuibei market, a gold jewelry manufacturing and trading hub in the southern metropolis of Shenzhen, consumer flow and gold sales this year have rebounded to the pre-pandemic level of 2019, said Chen Yuwan, general manager assistant of Shenzhen Jewelry Industry Service Co Ltd.
 
""On life-sharing platforms like Xiaohongshu and Douyin, content on how to buy gold jewelry and beans has been trending and widely searched,"" Chen added.
 
Gold manufacturers and dealers are also adjusting their market strategies to fully tap into the gold rush. Gao Dayan, who owns six franchised gold stores in East China's Shandong province, said that innovative products such as heritage gold, hard-pure gold, and ""China-chic"" jewelry are gaining popularity among consumers.
 
Gao said that, as he aligns his marketing with the new consumption trend, the total sales volume of his six stores from January to September is up by about 20 percent from the same period last year.
 
According to data from the China Gold Association, gold consumption in the Chinese market jumped 16.37 percent year-on-year in the first half of this year. Specifically, the consumption of gold jewelry increased 14.82 percent, and that of gold bars and coins by 30.12 percent.
 
A recent report released by the World Gold Council said that gold continues to dominate the country's jewelry market, with the inventory of gold accounting for 67 percent of the total jewelry inventory in Chinese jewelry outlets as of mid-year. The proportion expanded from 52 percent in 2021, according to the report.
 
Looking ahead, Liu Richeng, director of the futures department of Xiwang International Trade Co Ltd, said that although the RMB gold market has shown a relatively independent trajectory this year, it is still driven by the international market in general.
 
Liu said that both RMB and international gold prices fell in late September, which can be regarded as a correction to the price difference between the domestic and global gold markets. Liu projected that high premiums may return in the future.
 
Song Jiangzhen, a senior researcher at Guangdong Southern Gold Market Academy, said that considering investors' concerns over the international geopolitical situation, global gold prices are expected to see increased growth momentum in the short run.",chinadaily.com.cn,527,news,CN,en,,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202310/20/6531e8e1a3109068cafe80d2.jpeg,False,@ChinaDailyApp,12.086266,486405b8e527666a738e4776734acfcc

What's gold likely to do?<","(MENAFN- Investor Ideas) The situation in the Middle East is getting worse, and we're likely moments away from a full-blown military operation. What's gold likely to do?

In short, gold is likely to rally, but that is not the full or most useful reply.

Middle East Conflict Sparks Gold Rally

Before getting to the analysis itself, I want to provide a bit of background on the markets in general and how it translates into the current situation. ""Market buys the rumor and sells the fact."" is one of the Wall Street sayings.

This is the case, as the markets are forward-looking, and they keep discounting various versions of the future. As something becomes near-certain (and it's generally known), it's already discounted in the price.

Let's keep in mind that people tend to get too emotional about things - this mechanism also applies to the markets. So, as people keep discounting the possible fact or event, they also exaggerate in their expectations. In consequence, the price might move too far relative to where it should move.

And then, when the fact arrives, or the event finally does materialize, the market gets more realistic, and the price moves back to where it ""should"" be. It's then moving in the opposite direction to what ""makes sense"" based on the event itself.

For example, when the SLV ETF was launched many years ago, everyone and their brother were forecasting that the silver price would shoot to the moon due to the increased investment demand. It made sense. Silver price kept rallying before the ETF was launched. And you know what it did after the launch? Silver price topped shortly, and then it collapsed.

Why am I mentioning this today? Because the key driver behind gold's recent decline is the fear and expectations of war in the Middle East.

At this point it seems very likely that Israel will launch a military operation shortly. When this became very likely on Friday - after the warning from Israel - gold price truly soared.

Now, given what I wrote above about how prices, expectations, and events work, and knowing what happened to the silver prices after the key event materialized, what's likely to happen to the prices of gold after the military operation starts?

The forecast for gold price is actually bearish. To be clear, gold is not that likely to decline right away, but it is likely to decline soon.

It's usually very difficult to convince people about the above mechanism as it seems anti-intuitive, so let's check what happened when we saw a previous war outbreak - and one on a much bigger scale.

The Russian invasion on Ukraine was launched in late February 2022, and I marked that with a red dashed line. That was also when interest in ""war"" peaked - when there were many searches for ""war"" Google. Back then, gold topped in less than 2 weeks.

However, please note that the situation with Russia and Ukraine was vague - much more so than what we currently have in the Middle East, so the entire move from expectation or news to fact could be faster.

The area of conflict is much smaller in this case, but it doesn't make it any less tragic, and it doesn't make the fear and concern any smaller. The data confirms it as well.

This chart (the below charts are courtesy of Google Trends) shows that the number of searches about ""war"" is soaring right now.

It happened a few times in the past, and the biggest peak was in February 2022.

The analogy gets more interesting when we focus on the U.S. searches, and we focus on news only.

In this case, it's obvious that the current situation is similar to just two times from the recent history - to February 2022 and to late December 2019.

I marked both cases on the first chart - featuring gold price. What happened in both cases? Gold kept rallying for several days but for not longer than 2 weeks, and then it topped.

Then, in early 2020, gold price continued its upward trend (but after declining in the short term, and in 2022, gold price started a multi-month decline.

How Soon Will the Tides Turn?

What's likely to happen now? The fear / concern / expectations are already enormous, and the gold price is already after a rally. Did it top already? Most likely not (and it's good that we took profits from our previous short positions in miners before gold truly shot up), as the momentum was extremely strong. However, it seems that we're not far from the top.

The previous trend in gold was to the downside, which means that after the short-term top, the gold price is likely to decline once again - and the same is likely for silver and mining stocks.

How soon can the reversal take place? Probably several days or no longer than 2 weeks after the actual attack. Both could happen as early as this week.

The above is confirmed by the place where the two resistance lines cross (on the gold price chart). The vertexes of triangles created by such resistance lines tend to mark the times when the price reverses. The most recent move was to the upside, so it's quite likely that the next several will happen either this week or the next week. What this technique doesn't say is how high gold can rally before it reverses, and that's a different question.

Given the very emotional nature of the recent price moves, it's currently unclear how high gold can rally before it tops. Seeing gold top at about $1,960 would not be surprising, though.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,11.451857,a3ceae083d49fdee1a92fd8f78df43da

According to data from the Dubai Jewellery Group, 24K gold was trading at Dh236 per gram during the opening of the market on Thursday, marking a decrease from the previous night's closing price of Dh237 per gram. Similarly, other gold variants, including 22K, 21K, and 18K, also began trading at lower rates, specifically at Dh218.5 (USD59.49), Dh211.5 (USD57.58), and Dh181.25 (USD181.25) per gram, respectively.



This drop in gold prices came after a notable increase of Dh2.25 in the price of the 24K variant the previous day. On the global scale, spot gold exhibited a decrease of 0.14 percent, reaching USD1,948.3 per ounce by 9:23 AM UAE time.



Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, highlighted the recent surge in gold prices, noting that the precious metal surpassed its 200-day moving average (DMA) despite various challenges and the rise in US yields. According to Ozkardeskaya, gold is recognized as a dependable hedge against risky assets, which tend to suffer when market sentiment declines significantly.



Zain Vawda, an analyst at dailyFX, explained that gold's recent gains were a response to a growing sense of risk aversion among market participants. Vawda attributed this increase in risk aversion to an unfortunate incident—a hospital explosion in Gaza that prompted both Israel and Palestine to exchange accusations. The fallout from this incident revived concerns about the possibility of a broader conflict, subsequently driving up the demand for gold, which approached the USD1950 per ounce threshold.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_1.jpg,False,@menafn,10.513835,285099482265554d6f7bc7abd7fbefe0

Consumers were also attracted by the drop in precious metal prices recently when rates hit seven-month lows. However, the prices have recovered as investors rush to safe-haven commodity after the Middle East conflict.

The Indian festivals of Dhantera and Diwali will be marked in the second week of November. Buying precious metal and jewellery during Dhantera festival is considered auspicious by Indians.

When shoppers opt for 'lock-in', they pay roughly a certain amount – usually 10 per cent – in advance and block the gold rate. If the gold price increases, they can purchase at the blocked rate. If it falls below the blocked rate, they can draw mileage from the lower rate. It is this assured benefit that is motivating customers to increasingly opt for gold rate protection.

Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director of Kalyan Jewellers, said:'Yes, there was an increase in shoppers choosing 'lock-in' option on the back of the festive demand momentum.

'The gold rate 'lock-in' festive offers is almost like an annual ritual that our patrons always look forward to,' he said.

'We witnessed an uptick of such services being availed of during the pre-Diwali and pre-Dhanteras phase, which are considered among one of the most auspicious occasions to purchase gold. Similarly, the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, which is observed around April or May, is another such popular occasion, when people opt to make jewellery purchases,' he added.

The precious metal prices hit a seven-month low of $1,825 per ounce in the first week of October due to strong demand for the dollar and higher bond yields. It climbed to $1,932 on Friday due to the Middle East conflict.

200% increase in 'lock-in' option

John Paul Alukkas, managing director, Joyalukkas Group, also confirmed that there was an increase in shoppers choosing 'lock-in' options in the UAE, with a noticeable percentage rise.

He added that the customers in the UAE have a proactive approach to leverage favourable pricing conditions.

'Moreover, the next six months are all about celebrations, festivals and weddings, which has a direct correlation to the customers coming out in droves to purchase jewellery. Both these factors have had a substantial impact on jewellery purchases.'

He added that the option to block the gold rate is a definite advantage for customers as they can secure the lowest gold rate for themselves, regardless of the price fluctuation.

These crises include the war in Ukraine, escalating US-China tensions, rising interest rates, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the ongoing impact of climate change. Gold, historically considered the ultimate safe haven asset, has been one of the rare beneficiaries of these mounting global uncertainties.



In the past week, the price of gold has seen a modest increase of 2.5 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at just over USD1,979 per ounce, notably below its peak of USD2,048.45 earlier this year, which was reached during the banking crisis in April. Furthermore, it remains distant from its pandemic-driven high of USD2,074.88, recorded in August 2020.



However, the relationship between gold and crises is more complex than a straightforward surge in prices during tumultuous times. While ongoing conflicts, such as Israel's preparations for a ground invasion of Gaza and US President Joe Biden's warnings to Iran, Russia, and Hamas, may heighten global concerns, they are just one of the factors influencing the price of gold.



Two other key factors driving gold's price are the strength of the US dollar and interest rates. Gold is priced in US dollars, and a strong dollar can make it more expensive for buyers in other currencies, potentially reducing demand in major markets like China, India, and Turkey. Currently, the US Federal Reserve is contemplating further interest rate hikes to combat inflation, which is strengthening the dollar. Additionally, the dollar itself is serving as a safe-haven asset, often overshadowing the appeal of gold in times of uncertainty. Interest rates also play a role as gold does not generate income, making it less attractive when bond yields rise, as they are presently with 10-year US Treasuries offering approximately 5 percent.



In summary, while gold has seen some price gains during recent crises, its value is also influenced by currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the safe-haven appeal of the US dollar, adding layers of complexity to its performance in today's turbulent economic and geopolitical landscape.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_8_menafn.jpg,False,@menafn,11.995457,1a2682411f38f254aaf9e8b911e26541

The sharp increase in the price of the yellow metal comes ahead of the auspicious Dhanteras occasion for buying gold on November 10, as well as the approaching festive and wedding season when the demand for jewellery shoots up.

In the international market, too, gold prices have surged above $2,000 an ounce during the week, making it the third consecutive weekly gain, as geopolitical tensions rise amid the Israel-Hamas war.

According to market analysts this has spurred the demand for gold as a safe-haven investment.

Kama Jewelry MD Colin Shah expects the demand for gold to remain buoyant due to the strong ""sentimental value"" attached towards buying gold during the festive season and the Indian culture of gifting jewellery during weddings.

The recent volatility in the stock markets has also prompted investors to look at a safer bet and gold appears to be the ideal asset. Besides, the gold also provides a hedge against the strengthening dollar as the rupee has been weakening, said a senior bank official.

As the Israel-Hamas war threatens to escalate into a wider geopolitical conflict involving the US and Iran, spot gold price hit $2,000 levels on Friday and closed at 2,006 per ounce levels.

Gold future contract on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) for December 2023 expiry surged Rs 308 per gm and ended at Rs 61,260 levels on Friday.

At its peak during trading on October 20, the price for a troy ounce exceeded $2,000, Azernews reports, citing Kun News Agency.

The global dynamics of precious metal quotations were also reflected in the local market. The Central Bank of Uzbekistan on Monday, October 23, set the price at a new record level.

A gold bar weighing 5 grams now costs 4.027 million soums – 805.4 thousand soums per gram. Compared to Friday, prices increased by 1.98%, Spot writes with reference to the Central Bank.

Commemorative coins also reached a new maximum. For example, a 15-gram coin is now valued at 12,198,000 soums.

Since the beginning of the year, the price of the precious metal has broken several records. In March, the cost of the smallest bar for the first time crossed the mark of 3.8 million soums, and in early May - 3.9 million soums.

In the summer, a five-gram gold bar price dropped to 3.7 million soums. However, on August 14, quotes showed their strongest rally since the beginning of the year, adding 3%, and in September they renewed their peak levels for two days in a row.

The Central Bank began selling commemorative gold coins to the public in 2018, and gold bars joined them two years later. Individual buyers were allowed to export them from Uzbekistan, subject to conditions.

These steps were explained by the desire to reduce the dependence of the Uzbek economy on foreign currency. In addition, according to experts, access to gold will expand investment opportunities and help secure savings.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-10/23/A_8cbb9image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,11.441589,a728d8a3da8f0ddc2d214d2b0542dfee

At 9:00 AM local time, 24K gold was quoted at Dh239.25 (USD65.07) per gram, indicating a slight increase from the previous evening's closing rate of Dh239.0 per gram. Furthermore, various other gold categories, including 22K, 21K, and 18K, were trading at Dh221.5, Dh214.5, and Dh184.0 per gram, respectively.



Turning our gaze towards the global gold market, the spot price saw a modest 0.13 percent uptick, settling at USD1,976.27 at 9:30 AM UAE time. This price movement is closely intertwined with the anticipation gripping investors regarding forthcoming economic data, which is expected to provide vital cues on potential shifts in interest rates. Simultaneously, the global market remains on high alert, monitoring the ever-escalating tensions in the Middle East, which have been contributing to the volatility in various asset classes.



Ole Hansen, the esteemed head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, offered insights into the current market dynamics. He acknowledged that the energy market has displayed a relatively muted response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. This restraint can be attributed to the inherent complexity of accurately evaluating the risks associated with a significant supply disruption. In contrast, the gold market has been surging vigorously, with prices rallying by approximately USD160 over the course of the past two weeks.



This noteworthy surge in gold prices underscores the yellow metal's enduring appeal as a reliable safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty. As geopolitical events continue to unfold and economic data is set to be released, market participants and observers are keenly focused on how the gold market will navigate these intricate and potentially game-changing dynamics.

Data from the Dubai Jewellery Group revealed that 24K gold opened at Dh241.0 (USD 65.61) per gram, marking an increase of half a dirham per gram compared to the previous day's closing. Similarly, other gold categories, including 22K, 21K, and 18K, also commenced the trading day on a higher note, with rates of Dh223.0, Dh216.0, and Dh185.0 per gram, respectively.



These price surges reflect the ongoing global concerns stemming from the Middle East conflict, which have prompted investors to seek the safety of precious metals, particularly gold. Even in the face of a stronger US dollar and rising bond yields, gold maintained its appeal as a safe-haven asset.



Daniel McCarthy, a strategist at dailyFX, noted that gold prices have rallied despite the US dollar's strength in other markets and the resurgence of Treasury yields following a recent dip. The precious metal's ability to defy these trends and maintain its positive momentum has been a notable aspect of recent market dynamics, indicating increased volatility and potential for further significant price movements in the future.



Investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators, including the US GDP numbers for the third quarter and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. These figures are expected to influence market sentiment, with the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision looming on the horizon. The central bank has demonstrated a commitment to addressing inflation concerns through potential interest rate adjustments, adding an additional layer of complexity to the market outlook.



Nikos Kavalis, Managing Director at Metals Focus, emphasized that the Federal Reserve is evidently considering higher interest rates as a means of curbing inflation. These decisions will play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape, impacting not only gold prices but also broader financial markets and investment strategies.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_16.jpg,False,@menafn,10.093237,d7df4481413efa65820d2b3b88595140

Spot gold gained 0.3 per cent to $1,975.61 per ounce on softer US Treasury yields, but lacked impetus to rise further as bullion's safe-haven demand showed signs of fatigue after global leaders sought to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spreading

The precious metal declined in the previous two sessions and traded below five-month highs hit last week.

Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market at the FxPro, said gold experienced profit-taking after an impressive rally following the escalation in the Middle East.

'The cost of a troy ounce of gold was down to $1,955 at the peak of the European session on Tuesday, after a two-week rally from $1,811 to almost $2000 since the 6th of October. This week's opening with a gap down was a sign that the market had built considerable profit-taking demand. The gap was closed during the day, but the decline continued Tuesday,' he said.

Theoretically, he said there is a more bullish scenario for gold.

'While we often hear that rising government bond yields are bearish for gold, it is unlikely that significant capital will buy into a falling market to avoid catching a falling knife. Signs of a bottom forming could trigger an essential shift in the overriding trade, triggering a capital flow out of gold and into bonds,' he added.

Deadly blasts in Gaza on Tuesday fuelled concerns among global investors about conflict escalation, pushing them to move to safe-haven assets.

Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said that no matter how bad the situation gets in the Middle East, the way, and the intensity with which the market perceives the news will gradually decrease, and risk assets like gold and Swiss franc will eventually give back gains.

Gold prices were little changed Friday as the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields retreated on raised bets that the Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates, while investors awaited U.S. non-farm payrolls data for further cues.

Gold prices have surged on geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty

In this article Gold surges on safe-haven bets Gold ETFs see ongoing outflows Central banks demand hits year-to-date record Fed nearing the end of its tightening rate cycle Gold eyes more gains



Gold surges on safe-haven bets

Gold dropped to a low of around $1,810/oz on 4 October after the release of strong US jobs data fuelled expectations for a further US rate hike before the end of the year. Then, the direction of gold prices quickly changed following the outbreak of Israel-Hamas conflict on 7 October, with the precious metal nearing its record of about $2,075/oz set in 2020. Gold rallied 7.3% last month as demand for safe-haven assets has increased. We believe gold is likely to continue to benefit if Middle East tensions increase.

Safe-haven demand outweighs rising bond yields, US dollar



Refinitiv Eikon, ING Research

Demand for safer assets has outweighed the impact of rising real yields, which are normally a key driver of non-interest-bearing precious metal. Since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict, real yields rose 7.7% month over month, reaching a new high since 2007 while the US dollar trade-weighted index rose to an 11-month high in October. Higher yields and a stronger dollar are typically negative for gold. However, the precious metal has held up well despite its surge with geopolitical tensions becoming a bigger factor.

Gold ETFs see ongoing outflows

Yet, total holdings in bullion-backed ETFs have continued to decline despite rising spot prices. Gold ETFs have seen outflows of 189 tonnes so far this year and have now registered six successive quarters of negative demand, data from the World Gold Council (WGC) showed, with ETF and futures investors showing little appetite for the precious metal with rising bond yields offering an alternative source of real income for investors. Holdings fell by 139 tonnes (-US$8bn), although this was an improvement on the 244-tonnes outflow in the second quarter of 2022. Over the first nine months of this year investment demand was down by 21%, with most of that weakness driven by ETFs, particularly in the US and Europe, as investors increasingly took the view that major central banks – particularly the US Fed – will keep rates higher for longer.

ETF outflows continue

However, net-long positioning, reflecting sentiment in the gold market, turned positive in the second half of October as spot prices surged. COMEX net-long positionings rose 137% month over month to 29 October.

Investors fly back to safe-haven assets



CFTC, WGC, ING Research Central banks demand hits year-to-date record

Central banks have purchased around 800 tonnes of gold over the first three quarters of 2023, according to data from the World Gold Council (WGC). This was a record amount bought for a nine-month total as geopolitical concerns pushed central banks to increase allocation towards safety assets. Central banks' healthy appetite for gold is also driven by countries' desire to weaken their dependence on the US dollar as a reserve currency.

Central banks increased their gold purchases to 337t over the third quarter of the year primarily due to higher buying from China (+78 tonnes), Poland (+57 tonnes), Turkey (+39 tonnes) and India (+9 tonnes). China has been the largest buyer of gold this year amid an 11-month buying streak. The People's Bank of China has purchased 181 tonnes this year, taking gold holdings to 4% of its reserves.

Year-to-date, central bank net buying of gold is 14% ahead of 2022. This insatiable appetite has helped gold prices defy surging bond yields and a strong dollar. We believe this trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter amid tensions in the Middle East.

China leads central banks' gold buying spree



World Gold Council, ING Research Fed nearing the end of its tightening rate cycle

The Fed held rates steady in November, for a second straight meeting, as was widely anticipated. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted the bank may be done with further tightening. In latest US data, nonfarm payrolls rose 150,000 in October, below the estimate, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose, taking the pressure off the Fed to tighten policy further. Payrolls is the number that markets focus on and with unemployment rates and wages softening it all reinforces the view that the Fed is finished hiking interest rates, as our US economist believes .

Lower rates are typically positive for gold, which doesn't offer any interest.

Our US economist believes that the need for further policy rate hikes is now dramatically reduced and expects the starting point for Fed rate cuts in the second quarter of 2024.

Gold eyes more gains

We have revised our fourth quarter forecast upwards to $1,950/oz, raising our 2023 average to $1,937/oz given the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the risk of tensions escalating in the Middle East. However, we still believe the Fed's higher-for-longer narrative will keep the rally in check.

Looking into next year, we expect gold prices to move higher again next year to average $2,025/oz on the assumption that the Fed starts cutting rates in the second quarter of next year, the dollar weakens, safe-haven demand continues amid global economic uncertainty and central bank buying remains at high levels.

The 24K variant of the precious metal was trading at Dh241.5 per gram on Tuesday morning as compared to last night's close of Dh242.0 per gram. While 22K, 21K and 18K also opened lower at Dh223.5, Dh216.5 and Dh185.5 per gram, respectively, according to Dubai Jewellery Group data.

Globally, spot gold was steady at $1,994.67 per ounce by 9.20am UAE time. It slipped below the critical $2,000 milestone on Tuesday, as investors prepared for central bank meetings with a particular focus on the US Federal Reserve's policy outlook.

Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer, Century Financial, said after breaking through the $2,000 barrier on Friday, gold prices slightly declined but they nevertheless held onto their most recent gains as a result of the geopolitical tension in the Middle East, which ultimately served to boost the safe haven.

Although gold is a hedge against inflation, he said, an increase in interest rates by the US Fed could lessen its appeal.

According to CME's Fed Watch Tool, market players are currently pricing a 96.1 per cent chance that the interest rate will stay at current levels.

'Technically speaking, the price of gold is trading close to the $2,000/ounce mark and is still moving inside the bullish channel, this suggests that the bullish trend will continue, and we will likely reach our next major target at $2,020. As a result, the bullish trend scenario will continue to be active, and it may be preceded by a brief period of sideways fluctuation influenced by current stochastic negativity.

'As a reminder, breaking above the target could push the price to 2040, which would be the major resistance. Holding above $1,982 is essential to the expected rise continuing,' he added.

Gold futures fared similarly, falling by 0.8 percent to USD1,973.50.



The upward movement of the dollar index by 0.4 percent played a significant role in this decline, rendering gold more expensive for international buyers. Market analyst Carlo Alberto de Casa from Kinesis Money pointed out that the gold market is presently in a holding pattern, waiting for more conservative signals from the US Central Bank before any further upward momentum can be expected. He noted that prices are currently consolidating after having ventured into the overbought territory.



The month of October saw gold's value rise by more than seven percent, driven in part by escalating tensions in the Middle East, which led to increased demand for the precious metal as a safe-haven asset.



Investors are now looking forward to a series of speeches by several Federal Reserve officials scheduled for this week, with particular attention focused on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is set to address the audience on Wednesday and Thursday. Market sentiment currently leans towards a 90 percent probability that the US Central Bank will maintain interest rates at their current levels during the December meeting. Moreover, there's approximately an 80 percent chance of an interest rate cut in June of the following year, as indicated by the CME Fed Watch service.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_3.jpg,False,@menafn,10.748133,d876d83273f4e2fdbf505f0f257a4d56

The Dubai Jewellery Group data showed 24K trading at Dh240.25 per gram at the opening of the markets on Monday as compared to last week's close of Dh241.25 per gram. Similarly, the other variants of the precious metal also opened lower on Monday. The 22K, 21K and 18K were trading at Dh222.5, Dh215.5 and Dh184.75 per gram, respectively, at 9 am local time.

Globally, spot gold was down by 0.26 per cent at $1,983.45 per ounce by 9.15 am UAE time.

The precious metal price has been steady after the weak US jobs data raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates further, pushing dollar and bond yields lower.

Warren Venketas, analyst at dailyFX, said the yellow metal exploited the weaker-than-expected US jobs report issued last week that showed a higher unemployment rate and lower wage growth.

'Although one release does not make a trend, this may be the beginning of a weaker jobs market. The Federal Reserve would welcome such data in an environment where tight monetary policy conditions have heightened recessionary and stagflation concerns of recent... Overall, gold's attractiveness has increased considering the opportunity cost of holding gold has decreased,' said Venketas.

In immediate transactions, gold experienced a marginal 0.1 percent increase, reaching USD1,938.12 per ounce as of 07:14 GMT. Concurrently, US gold futures rose by 0.3 percent, settling at USD1,942.50. The past week witnessed a 2.8 percent decline in gold prices, marking the most significant weekly setback in over a month. This downturn was primarily attributed to remarks by US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which dampened expectations of future interest rate cuts.



Nicholas Vrabel of ABC Refinery highlighted the prevailing focus on how the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data might influence the Fed's stance on interest rates. He noted that market movements were relatively subdued in anticipation of this crucial data release.



The release of consumer price data in the United States is slated for tomorrow, Tuesday, with investors closely monitoring the figures for potential impacts on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The dollar, exhibiting a 0.1 percent gain against major currencies and reaching its highest level in a week in the previous session, has contributed to the diminished appeal of gold for holders of other currencies.

In immediate trading, the value of gold witnessed a decline of 0.9 percent, settling at USD1,940.20, marking a weekly loss of 2.6 percent, equivalent to USD66. This adds to the broader context, with the precious metal enduring losses of approximately 3.4 percent over a two-week period. The impact was not limited to immediate trades, as evidenced by US futures contracts, which saw a 1.6 percent drop upon settlement, closing at USD1,937.70 and registering a weekly loss of 3.1 percent.



The decline in gold prices comes as a result of a combination of factors, notably the robust performance of the dollar, which tends to make gold more expensive for investors using other currencies, thus dampening its appeal. Additionally, the rise in Treasury bond yields creates alternative investment opportunities, diverting attention and funds away from non-interest-bearing assets like gold.



Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as the precious metal, often seen as a safe-haven asset, reacts sensitively to shifts in global economic conditions and monetary policy. The recent trend highlights the delicate balance gold maintains within the broader financial landscape, and observers are keenly watching for any shifts that might signal a change in this dynamic in the coming weeks.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_10.jpg,False,@menafn,10.348958,3649c27e5969d9704e1b0f6ffa6c6ecf

On another note, global stock market trading was mixed early this week, with Wall Street ending its third consecutive week of gains with slight increases. In stock trading, the German DAX index fell by 0.1% to 15907.92, while the French CAC 40 index rose by 0.3% to 7256.93. also, the UK's FTSE 100 index dropped by 0.3% to 7481.86 points. Finally, the futures of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also showed little change.

In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan broke its September peak, reaching its highest level in 33 years before falling to 33388.03, a decrease of 0.6%. Nearby, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose by 1.6% to 17732.36, and the Shanghai Composite index increased by 0.5% to 3068.32. On Monday, China announced that it would keep its key lending interest rates unchanged, as expected, due to the weakness of the yuan and the need to assess the impact of recent stimulus measures on the economy.

In South Korea, the KOSPI index rose by 0.9% to 2491.20. The Australian S&P/ASX 200 index increased by 0.1% to 7058.40. meanwhile, there was no significant change in the Taiwan TAIEX. Moreover, the SET index in Bangkok dropped by 0.1% following the government planning agency's announcement yesterday, revealing that the Thai economy experienced slower growth than anticipated in the fourth quarter. Thus, this was attributed to subdued exports and agriculture, despite robust consumer spending and a rebound in tourism.

By the performance of the US stock indices at the end of last week, the S&P 500 index rose by 0.1% to 4514.02, nearing its highest level in three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by less than 0.1% to 34947.28 points, and the Nasdaq Composite index rose by 0.1% to 14125.48 points.

Overall, markets hope that US inflation will subside enough for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates, which are affecting the market. Already, The Federal Reserve has raised the key interest rate to the highest level since 2001, attempting to slow down the economy and weaken financial markets enough to control inflation without causing a painful recession. Recently, traders are speculating on when the Federal Reserve will actually start cutting interest rates, which could stimulate investment prices and provide oxygen to the financial system. obviously, The Federal Reserve has stated that it plans to keep interest rates high for some time to ensure the final victory in the battle against inflation, but traders believe that cuts may begin early in the summer of 2024.

In the bond market, another indicator of the gold price, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds rose to 4.47% early Monday from 4.44% late Friday. Just a few weeks ago, the inflation rate was above 5%, the highest level since 2007, causing a decline in stock prices and other investments. Clearly, the extremely sharp drop in Treasury yields and the very high rise in stock prices could conspire against Wall Street. However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said after the recent meeting of the Federal Reserve on US interest rates that it might not rise further if the summer surge in Treasury yields and the ongoing drop in stock prices ""continues."" Such pressures could act as alternatives to further interest rate hikes on their own.

Finally, one potential concern is inflation, which has eased in recent weeks. Oil prices fell amid concerns about the mismatch between the abundant supply of crude and the lack of demand.

Based on the performance of the daily chart below and despite the halt in gains, the overall trend for the gold price XAU/USD remains upward. Obviously, it is closer to testing the psychological resistance of $2000 per ounce if it moves towards the resistance level of $1985 per ounce again.

The question is: Will the price of gold decline in the upcoming days?

The answer to this question depends on the performance of the US dollar and the appetite of investors for risk. As, the response to global geopolitical tensions led by the conflict in the oil-rich Middle East. Als, the future of the policies of the world's central banks.

The price of gold XAU/USD may rise to surpass the psychological resistance of $2,000 per ounce again if the US dollar continues to weaken in response to the announcement of the content of the minutes of the last meeting of the US Federal Reserve this week.

On the other hand, US stock indices have rebounded. The most influential factor that pushed US stocks higher last week was the hope that US inflation would ease enough for the Federal Reserve to finally end the rate hikes that are affecting the market. The Federal Reserve had already raised the main interest rate to its highest level since 2001, in an attempt to slow the economy and weaken financial markets enough to control inflation without causing a painful recession.

Last week, a report showed that US consumer inflation had slowed more than expected last month, raising hopes that the Federal Reserve could strike a delicate balance. Furthermore, subsequent readings bolstered hopes after signaling that inflation and the overall economy may be slowing down.

Now, traders are trying to bet on when the Federal Reserve can actually start cutting US interest rates, which could boost investment prices and provide oxygen to the financial system. The Federal Reserve has said it plans to keep US interest rates high for a while to ensure a final victory in the fight against inflation, but traders believe cuts could begin as early as summer 2024. Nearby, one potential source of concern about inflation has retreated in recent weeks. Oil prices have fallen amid concerns about a mismatch between the abundance of crude supply and weak demand.

In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.43% from 4.44% late Thursday. Just a few weeks ago, the inflation rate was above 5%, its highest level since 2007, which led to a decline in stock prices and other investments. Of course, a sharp enough decline in Treasury yields and a large enough rise in stock prices could ultimately conspire to work against Wall Street markets. For his part, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said after the Fed's last meeting on interest rates that he might not raise rates further if the summer jump in Treasury yields and the decline in stock prices remained'persistent.' This is because such pressures can act as substitutes for further rate hikes on their own.

According to the performance on the daily chart below, the price of gold XAU/USD is still on an upward trend and the bulls will strongly control the direction. Therefore, if it moves towards the psychological resistance level of $2,000 per ounce, which is the closest to it now. Meanwhile, moving towards it and above could move the technical indicators towards overbought levels, but this could be ignored if the current factors driving gold gains continue. On the other hand, and at the same time period, the price of gold XAU/USD may abandon its current upward path. Shortly, if prices return to the support levels of 1960, 1952, and 1940 USD, respectively.

Despit","(MENAFN) On Wednesday, gold prices experienced a decline, slipping below the USD2,000 mark as the dollar found stability following recent fluctuations. Despite this, the descent in gold values was tempered by market expectations that the US Federal Reserve may have concluded its cycle of monetary tightening. In spot transactions, gold registered a 0.1 percent decrease, settling at USD1,996.79 per ounce after reaching a three-week peak of USD2,007.29 in the preceding session. Concurrently, US gold futures mirrored this trend with a 0.1 percent dip, reaching USD1,998.80.



The dollar, having retreated to its lowest levels in two and a half months in the prior session, saw consolidation against other major currencies. This shift in the dollar's trajectory is pivotal, as a weaker dollar typically renders gold more affordable for holders of alternative currencies. The interplay between the dollar's movement and gold prices underscores the intricate dynamics of global financial markets.



Adding to the nuanced landscape, minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting revealed a cautious approach among officials. The consensus was to exercise prudence and consider raising interest rates only if progress in curbing inflation slows. This stance aligns with broader market sentiments that anticipate the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates at their current levels during the December meeting. Moreover, there exists a notable 60 percent probability, as suggested by CME's Fed Watch service, that interest rates might be lowered by at least 25 basis points by May.

Investors eagerly awaited the release of the minutes from the latest US Federal Reserve meeting, seeking insights into potential shifts in interest rate expectations.



In spot transactions, gold climbed 0.6 percent to reach USD1,988.29 per ounce by 0133 GMT, while US gold futures saw a 0.5 percent increase, reaching USD1,990.10. Analyst Edward Meier highlighted the ongoing decline in dollar yields and US bonds, coupled with robust demand from central banks, as key factors propelling gold's upward trajectory. Meier noted, ""Dollar yields and US bonds continue to decline. Demand from central banks is also very strong. All of these things stimulate gold. The market is reconsidering this decline that we witnessed yesterday.""



The US dollar approached its lowest levels in over two and a half months, reflecting investor expectations of a potential decline in US interest rates in the coming year. A weakened dollar tends to make gold more affordable for holders of other currencies. Meanwhile, US 10-year Treasury bond yields lingered near their lowest points in two months, a trend initiated the previous week.



Investor focus intensified as the minutes from the Federal Reserve's recent meeting were set to be disclosed at 1900 GMT. Signs of decelerating inflation in the United States reinforced the belief that the Federal Reserve has concluded its cycle of interest rate hikes.

The gold and silver prices in India depend on several factors, including the value of the rupee against the dollar. Global demand also plays a key role in determining the trends observed in the rate of precious metals.
GOLD, SILVER PRICES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
Gold held steady on Friday, set for its second consecutive weekly gain, supported by a weaker US dollar as markets grew confident that the Federal Reserve was done with its interest rate hikes, news agency Reuters reported.
According to the latest metal report, spot gold held ground at $1,992.73 per ounce, as of 0431 GMT. Bullion has risen 0.7 per cent this week. US gold futures were little changed at $1,993.60.
Spot gold may retest a resistance at $1,999 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain into $2,009-$2,016 range, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.

The continued weakness of the US dollar is important for the continued rise in the price of gold. Vice versa. This depends on the reaction of markets and investors to the results of the economic data and hints of the path to raising US interest rates, expressed by Federal Reserve officials this week, led by Jerome Powell, the bank's governor. It must be considered that performance may include selling operations to take profits. Therefore, one must be careful not to buy gold from strong peaks.

In general, investors are waiting for updates on inflation and how American consumers feel about the economy. Later Tuesday, the Conference Board will issue an update on US consumer confidence, which has remained strong throughout the year. Economists polled by FactSet expect another strong reading for the October report. Next Thursday, Wall Street markets will closely monitor October government data on the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of US inflation. Economists expect this measure to continue to ease, as has been the case since mid-2022.

Investors have become cautiously optimistic that inflation has calmed enough to enable the Federal Reserve to put an end to aggressive interest rate hikes. On the other hand, the overall US economy remained strong enough in the face of rising interest rates and inflation to avoid a recession. Accordingly, analysts said that signs of a slowdown in the US economy, and that conditions in China are still uncertain, are affecting sentiment.

There is no doubt that the recent gains in gold prices (XAU/USD) have been enough to push technical indicators towards strong overbought levels. However, the continued presence of the factors that have driven gold prices higher, as mentioned above, will ensure that the bulls remain in control of the trend for a while. According to the daily chart performance, and as I mentioned before, the psychological resistance level of $2,000 per ounce is a strong catalyst for the bulls to maintain control. Thus, this trend will be tested this week with the release of a package of important US economic data and statements from officials of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which will have a strong impact on the dollar and therefore on gold prices, so caution is advised.

Currently, the closest resistance levels for gold prices are $2,022, $2,032, and $2,040 per ounce, respectively. In contrast, the first break of the current uptrend requires gold prices to move towards support levels of $1,980 and $1,965 per ounce, respectively.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/28/DF_84e26image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,12.899906,2a5342613dd5afc819752eea3dc233bf

Gold prices have been rising in the international market on the back of depreciating US dollar and falling bond yields.

There also growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates in the coming months.

Spot gold rose 0.24 per cent to cross the $2,046 per ounce by 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, which is the highest price since May 5.

US gold futures for December delivery rose 0.3 per cent to $2,045.40 per ounce.

Gold prices have now risen by close to 10 per cent from the beginning of the year.

Gold prices varied across different cities in India. Chennai recorded the highest price of 10 gm of 24 carat gold at Rs 63,050 while in Delhi and Mumbai the prices were Rs 62,710 and Rs 62,560, respectively.

Gold prices have been rising in the global market as the dollar has continued to depreciate against a basket of major currencies and is currently close to a three-month low which makes gold cheaper to buy in other foreign currencies.

Expectations of low interest rates makes financial instruments less attractive for investors compared to gold which is considered a safe investment.

The demand for gold in the domestic market remains firm amid the marriage season as the precious metal is gifted to brides and grooms in large quantities.

US Dollar Up but Bearish Risks Grow, Setups on EUR/USD, GBP/USD Before Powell
U.S. Treasury yields bounced back on Thursday after San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said that it is premature to declare victory against inflation and that policymakers are not yet thinking about reducing borrowing costs.
The rally in rates, which boosted the 
U.S. dollar
 across the board, weighed on technology stocks and non-yielding assets, with the Nasdaq 100 sliding for the second day in a row and gold prices stalling at technical resistance. Meanwhile, 
USD
/
JPY
 rose sharply, bouncing off its 100-day simple moving average.
Volatility could increase in the coming days, especially as Fed Chair Powell is set to engage in a fireside chat at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday. It is crucial for traders to focus on his remarks, given the recent mixed signals and inconsistent messaging from the central bank.
POSSIBLES FED SCENARIOS
1) Hawkish rethoric
Hawkish comments by Powell favoring higher interest rates for longer are likely to exert upward pressure on U.S. yields, fostering conditions for the continuation of the U.S. dollar's recent recovery. This, in turn, might negatively impact both gold prices and the Nasdaq 100
2) Dovish outcome
Lack of strong pushback against the dovish 
monetary policy
 outlook reflected in market pricing could convince traders the Fed is about to capitulate, weighing on yields and the greenback. While this scenario could create a virtuous cycle for bullion and tech stocks, it could send USD/JYP sharply lower.
BOTTOM LINE
To prevent further easing of financial conditions, which could complicate efforts to restore price stability sustainably, Powell could come out swinging, pledging to stay the course and to maintain a restrictive stance for an extended period. This position could disrupt the bullish momentum seen in the equity market and precious metals complex over the past few weeks.

Gold rallied sharply in recent weeks, briefly reaching its best levels since May. Prices, however, have been unable to push past the $2,050 threshold, with sellers defending this barrier tooth and nail for now. It is too early to know for sure if this technical ceiling will hold, but if it ultimately does, it won't be long before we see a drop towards $2,010. XAU/USD might find stability upon testing this area, but a breach could prompt a bearish move toward $1,985 and $1,960 if the weakness persists.
Conversely, if upward momentum resurfaces with fury and pushes prices decisively above $2,050, gold could be headed towards its all-time high above $2070 in short order, the next major resistance to watch closely.

The Nasdaq 100 soared in November, rising more than 10% and posting its largest monthly gain since July 2022, when it advanced 12.5%. 
Despite the strong upward momentum
, the tech index has started to stall out this week, with prices struggling to clear technical resistance near 16,100.
While it would not be unusual to see a healthy pullback after such a strong performance, especially if markets have become overly exuberant of late, a break above 16,100 could unleash animal spirits on 
Wall Street
, invigorating bullish momentum and propelling prices towards their all-time highs set in 2021.
On the other hand, if sentiment starts to deteriorate and the bulls head for the hills to wait for better entry points, we could see a drop towards at 15,700, followed by 15,500. Although the tech index could encounter support in this region during a decline, a move below it could send prices towards 15,300.

USD/JPY has been 
down on its luck in recent weeks
, dragged down by broad-based U.S. dollar weakness. However, the pair managed to stabilize over the past couple of days near its 100-day simple moving average, which has led to a moderate recovery. If gains pick up momentum in the coming sessions, resistance appears at 149.70. Surpassing this obstacle might prove daunting for the bullish camp, but doing so could trigger a rally towards 150.90, followed by 152.00.
On the flip side, if the nascent rebound ends abruptly and gives way to a bearish reversal, primary support is found at 147.25. Preserving this technical floor is essential as a breakdown might set off a decline towards channel support at 146.00. On further losses, the focus shifts to 144.50.

According to the Dubai Jewellery G,"(MENAFN- Khaleej Times) Gold prices continued their upward trend on Tuesday morning as the precious metal hit a six-month high.

According to the Dubai Jewellery Group data, the 24K opened half a dirham higher at Dh244.0 per gram on Tuesday while 22K, 21K and 18K were trading at Dh226.0, Dh218.75 and Dh187.5 per gram, respectively.

Globally, spot gold rose to $2,015.65 per ounce in the morning trade, hitting a six-month peak on the back of expectations that an end to the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle would keep the dollar and yields under check.

Charu Chanana and Redmond Wong, market strategists at Saxo Bank, said gold prices managed to clear the October peak of the $2,010 barrier as it climbed to a six-month high amid lower yields and a weaker dollar.'Our technical analyst sees the next barrier at $2,039 but there is room up to the previous peak of around $2,070-78,' said Saxo Bank analysts.

Wael Makarem, financial markets strategists lead – Mena at Exness, said gold prices continued their ascent, extending two consecutive weeks of gains to reach their previous peak for October.

'Gold benefited from a market consensus that the Federal Reserve has largely concluded its rate hikes, with increasing expectations of a rate cut in the second quarter of next year. Additionally, a weaker US dollar, sliding US yields and a slowing global economy are enhancing gold's appeal as a safe haven asset. This week's US economic data, particularly on GDP growth and inflation, could affect sentiment and, consequently, gold prices,' he said.

According to Dubai Jewellery Group data, the 24K was trading at Dh243.75 per gram at the opening of the markets on Monday as compared to last week's close of Dh242.5 per gram, up by Dh1.25.

Similarly, the variants of the precious metals also opened higher with 22K trading at Dh225.75, 21K at Dh218.5 and 18K at Dh187.25.

Spot gold rose 0.55 per cent to $2,013.55 per ounce by 9.23 am UAE time.

According to Zain Vawda, an analyst at dailyFX, said gold prices enjoyed a positive last week as buyers kept the metal supported, with a struggling US dollar helping as well.

'Both gold and silver threatened a selloff, but buyers kept prices steady for the majority of what was a shortened trading week. Looking at gold though and the failure to find acceptance above the $2,000/oz mark could leave the precious metal vulnerable,' he said.

Vawda added that the key events that could stoke volatility in the US dollar and thus in gold prices are likely to be the ISM data and of course the US Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation, the Core PCE data.

'Markets have bought into the idea of rate cuts in 2024 with around 90bps currently priced in. I have mixed feelings on what to expect yet given that I do believe demand will face constraints as consumers feel the heat but I would prefer to see some signs that the job market is cooling.'

Vawda expects short bursts of buying and selling following data releases to continue this week.

At the end of last week's trading, the price of gold XAU/USD jumped to an all-time high. Nearby, it is reaching the resistance level of $2,075 per ounce, with a decline in the US dollar and a decline in Treasury yields.

In general, financial markets, which are seeing their benchmark indices rise, are responding to the Federal Reserve's decision and expectations of a cut in US interest rates next year. According to trading, gold prices recorded weekly gains of 4.3%, adding to their rise since the beginning of 2023 by more than 14%.

In the same performance, silver prices, the sister of gold , traded at the level of $26 per ounce. According to trading, the price of the white metal jumped by 6% last week, raising its performance since the beginning of the year to nearly 7%.Will the price of gold decrease in the coming days?

After the price of gold (XAU/USD) fell below $1850 per ounce in October, we recommended buying gold at every falling level, and gold prices had seen a tear, with inflation trending lower. As a result, some market analysts believe that the gold price is on track for some decline due to how hot the rally has been over the past month. During Friday's trading, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 70 level, indicating an overbought climate. Meanwhile, as the annual inflation rate continues to slow, investors are betting that the US central bank will cut interest rates much earlier than expected.

However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech on Friday that monetary authorities are not even considering cutting US interest rates and that such talks would be'premature.' Furthermore, he added that any reversal in the data would require another interest rate hike. Also, Powell added in a speech at Spelman College in Atlanta,'It would be premature to confidently conclude that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate about when the policy will be eased'. Ending by,'We stand ready to tighten the policy further if it becomes appropriate to do so.'

Recently, gold prices (XAU/USD) found additional support from the decline in Treasury yields and the decline in the dollar price. Simultaneously, bond market yields fell across the board, with the 10-year bond yield falling 13 basis points to 4.22%. similarly, the yield on two-year bonds fell by 15.4 basis points to 4.561%, while the yield on 30-year bonds fell by 10.1 basis points to 4.41%.

Prominently, gold is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates because it affects the opportunity cost of owning non-yielding bullion.

Another factor affecting the gold market, the US Dollar Index (DXY). This index measures the US currency's performance against a basket of other major currencies , fell to 103.12, from opening at 103.50. Overall, the index recorded a weekly loss of 0.3% and decreased by 0.4% since the beginning of the year to date. The rule, a weaker dollar is beneficial for US dollar-denominated goods because it makes it cheaper for foreign investors to buy them.

As for other metals markets, copper futures rose to $3,899 per pound. Also, Platinum futures rose to $938.10 an ounce. Contrarily, Palladium futures fell to $1,012.00 an ounce Price Forecast and Analysis Today:

Based on the performance on the long-term chart, the price of gold XAU/USD has pushed all technical indicators towards strong levels of overbought. Meanwhile, in the case of that the US dollar recovers this week after the announcement of better-than-expected US jobs numbers, the price of gold could be exposed to strong profit-taking sales. Therefore, XAU/USD could not be ruled out with a return to the level of $2,000 per ounce again. However, it is important to consider that the numbers are below all expectations and the continued weakness of the US dollar. So, this situation could not rule out the movement of the price of gold to a new historical record level of $2,100 per ounce.

However, the precious metal faced a subsequent decline under the weight of a strengthening dollar. Spot gold witnessed a 0.4 percent drop, settling at USD2,062.80 per ounce, while US gold futures also dipped by 0.4 percent to USD2,082.40.



The surge in gold prices earlier in the Asian session, with a nearly two percent jump to the record level of USD2,111.39, was attributed to renewed expectations of impending interest rate cuts. These expectations were fueled by remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, where he indicated that there was no current contemplation of interest rate reductions.



The subsequent decline in gold prices was influenced by a 0.3 percent increase in the dollar index, rendering the yellow metal more expensive for holders of other currencies. Tim Waterer, Chief Market Analyst at KK, noted the prevailing sentiment among traders, stating, ""After Powell's speech, traders have become more convinced that we are at the peak of US interest rates, and thus the next path is likely to be downward rather than upward.""



Chairman Powell's emphasis on the absence of current considerations for interest rate cuts contributed to the market's interpretation that a peak in US interest rates had been reached. Lower interest rates are perceived to reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, making it a more attractive investment in a low-interest-rate environment. The trajectory of interest rates will likely remain a key determinant of gold prices, with market participants closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including Friday's US non-farm payrolls report, for further insights into interest rate expectations.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_16.jpg,False,@menafn,13.610694,f2aa9403de7709e037cbcbe9da74040b

Spot gold surged to a record, crossing $2,100 per ounce in early Asian trading on Monday, and experts predicted further fresh highs as the global rush for bullion may continue on growing expectations for US rate cuts early next year.
 
Prices of gold futures also touched a record high. The benchmark COMEX gold futures surpassed $2,150 per ounce, a daily increase of over 3 percent. COMEX is an abbreviation of the Commodity Exchange Inc, a futures and options market in the United States.
 
Gold-related stocks saw a substantial opening surge in the A-share market on Monday. Shares of Chifeng Gold rose nearly 6 percent to close at 14.87 yuan ($2) per share.
 
Shares of both Sichuan Rongda Gold and Shandong Gold Group surged more than 4 percent.
 
Gold jewelry prices of major Chinese brands such as Chow Tai Fook exceeded 630 yuan per gram on Monday.
 
Li Ting, manager of the investment advisory department at Tongguan Jinyuan Futures, said the weakening US economy is one of the reasons behind surging gold prices.
 
Li said investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will initiate an early rate cut in the first half of next year, propelling the continuous rise in gold prices.
 
Wu Zijie, precious metals analyst at Jinrui Futures, said that the safe-haven sentiment is also driving gold prices to new highs. The sustained economic weakness in the US and geopolitical conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have heightened global economic and political uncertainties, contributing to increased safe-haven demand and leading to heightened need for gold as a value-preserving asset.
 
Everbright Securities predicted that both gold prices and gold-related equities will experience an uptrend in the first half of 2024.
 
It also said a slowdown in the US economic growth rate in 2024 is highly possible and anticipated a US rate cut and a weaker dollar next year, paving the way for an uptrend in gold prices and gold-related equities.
 
According to Everbright Securities, gold prices are likely to continue to set records next year.

Zain Vawda, analyst at dailyFX, said investors appeared to be taking a pause ahead of the US jobs report after what can be described as a turbulent week for the precious metal.

Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the precious metal sees support near the $2,000 per ounce as falling US yields and fading appetite for equities continue to push capital.

Meanwhile, the World Gold Council data showed central banks' gold-buying slowed in October but did nothing to alter the overall trend of robust buying that has captured the attention of investors. Reported global net purchases totalled 42 tonnes during the month, 41 per cent lower than September's revised total of 72 tonnes, but still 23 per cent above the January-September monthly average of 34 tonnes.

 Powerful Bearish Combination","(MENAFN- Investor Ideas) The huge rally in gold and the monstrous decline that followed provided a sign of epic proportions.

Powerful Bearish Combination

Gold price's huge-volume reversal is the last thing that anyone even remotely interested in the precious metals market should ignore.

Gold price was just soaring to new highs like there was no tomorrow, and then it happened. ""NO"" – was the sellers' response, said with a voice that doesn't accept any comebacks. Gold price fell so hard that they not only canceled the quick rally but even erased whatever they had gained on Friday. And some of the previous gains, too.

Invalidations of breakouts are generally immediate sell signals. The same goes for ""shooting star"" reversal candlesticks, which we saw yesterday. In particular, when that candlestick formation is confirmed by high volume.

Since gold reversed on enormous volume, and it invalidated its key breakout (above the previous all-time highs), we have an immensely powerful bearish combination here.

The GDXJ Invalidation

And mining stocks?

Miners have been very weak compared to gold, except for maybe a week or so. Miners are not even close to testing their all-time highs. They were not even close to their 2023 highs, let alone their 2020 highs.

And yet, the GDXJ suffered an invalidation of its own. It moved back below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level based on its 2023 decline. As I already wrote above, invalidations are sell signals, so the above serves as a bearish confirmation of what we saw in gold.

If that wasn't enough, we saw sell signals from the RSI indicator as it moved back below the 70 level in both gold and GDXJ. In the case of the latter, it happened after the RSI was in one of the most overbought conditions in years. The fact that previous such situations accompanied the most important tops is not to be ignored.

This combination of factors is extremely bearish for the short term. Since the medium-term trend in the miners has been down for many months, and together with the above, it creates a massive trading opportunity. It looks like our 11-completed-unleveraged-trade winning streak will grow further shortly.

Now, can gold still reverse its course and soar to new highs, taking the mining stocks with it? Yes, it can indeed happen. There are very specific signs that would foretell that, and we might see them any day or hour here, but they are not present at the moment of writing these words.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,12.313111,23869778f4309a40d34049159d1d7ece

The surge in gold futures prices gained momentum at the end of the trading week, influenced by the remarks of Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve.



In the latest trading session, gold futures prices for February delivery, the most actively traded contract, experienced a notable increase of 1.6 percent, equivalent to USD32.5, settling at USD2,089.7 per ounce. This marked a significant 3.25 percent gain since the beginning of the week. The decline in the dollar index, which measures the performance of the US currency against a basket of six major currencies, by 0.35 percent during the previous trading session further contributed to the strengthening of gold prices.



Jerome Powell's statements added impetus to the surge in gold prices, as he expressed expectations of a slowdown in spending and production growth in the coming year. Powell attributed this anticipated deceleration to the diminishing effects of the pandemic and the impact of the current restrictive monetary policy on aggregate demand. The current monetary policy is exerting downward pressure on both economic activity and inflation, prompting investors to turn to gold as a reliable hedge against uncertainty.



This sustained upward movement in gold prices underscores the precious metal's resilience as a safe-haven asset, with investors closely monitoring economic indicators and central bank policies for signals that might impact the financial landscape. As the global economic outlook remains uncertain, gold continues to be a favored asset for investors seeking stability and security in their portfolios.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_10.jpg,False,@menafn,11.764459,858f4aefc3c2e2d6051940e43729947a

The yellow metal has been on the upward trend over the past session. On Friday evening, the price rose to $2,075 on the background of risk appetite with reduced liquidity in the instrument. On Monday, the price of gold reached $2135, a new historical price maximum.

'The nature of the movement on Friday and Monday morning suggests that we have seen the bears in gold wash out of the market. As liquidity returned, the price pulled back to $2,060... Joining the upward move in gold may be too dangerous right now,' said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro.

'The next few days for gold are decisive for the subsequent trend. The ability to hold above $2,050 will point to continued extreme bullish sentiment in the precious metals market.'

He added that the previous three times that gold made highs - in 2011 and three times in the last three years - it went into a sharp and deep correction that lasted for years in the first case and months in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Retailers have said that multiple reasons including the rising prices, an influx of tourists and attractive offerings have caused consumers to buy gold in the countr . However, is it the best time to invest in the yellow metal? Team KT posed the question to experts.

According to Shamlal Ahamed, managing director – international operations at Malabar Gold & Diamonds, the answer depends on people's circumstances.'This is wedding season, so many people will have a limit to how long they can hold off without buying,' he said, speaking to Khaleej Times.

However, in his opinion, there is a chance of a small correction in gold prices shortly.'There is a possibility of a correction, especially before December 31,' he said.'We are expecting a dip of $50 to $100. I would advise customers to take immediate advantage of such price drops, if there are any.'

This sentiment was echoed by other industry insiders.'Gold prices could face some risks over the short term and could see some price corrections if the dollar and US yields continue to rise,' said Paul Turner, Executive Director at Capex Middle East.

Gold has seen a steep upward rise, hitting a six-month peak on the back of expectations that an end to the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle would keep the dollar and yields under check. On Friday, gold hit $2,075 an ounce, and remained on track to soar towards an all-time high, around the $2,079-2,080 zone set in May.

Price protection

According to Shamlal, those wishing to invest in gold should start utilising offers that are available to them.'Most jewellery stores offer customers a feature called price protection,' he said.'This allows people to pay money and reserve gold for the gold rate of the day they are paying on. If the price drops, then they can buy the gold jewellery for the lower price. This is a great feature for buyers to make sure that they get the best rate.'

Historically, gold has been one of the most popular investment options because of its ability to hold value through inflation, economic crises and fluctuation in currencies.

However, Paul sounded a warning to future investors.'Economic data and market expectations could play a significant role in the future performance of gold and should be monitored closely,' he said.'US job market and PMI data releases this week as well as the publication of inflation data next week could affect market expectations and the Federal Reserve's decision next week. The latter could significantly impact the course of gold prices.'

Upward trend

Experts point out that the value of gold has been reflecting an upward trend for a while and could continue to do so.'Gold prices have been increasing for the past two months as expectations have been shifting toward a softer monetary policy in the US and other countries,' said Paul.'Economic conditions have also been deteriorating to a certain extent while geopolitical tensions continue to represent a risk for various markets. As a result, gold prices could still find some room to climb.'

Shamlal also agreed that a long term increase in prices was on the horizon due to multiple reasons.'As long as the geopolitical tensions continue, there are chances the prices will go up higher,' he said.'The decrease in crude oil prices is another reason for gold prices to increase. Several international investors and moving their institutional investments over to gold. Overall, it is looking quite bullish for gold right now.'

The precious metal reached USD2,135.39 per ounce at the start of Asian trading, eclipsing the previous record set in 2020 during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the rally was followed by a decline around 10:30 local time, with gold trading at approximately USD2,069.01 per ounce.



Ricardo Evangelista, an analyst at Active Trades Consulting, highlighted that the rush to buy gold is a response to ""growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce the interest rate during the first quarter of 2024."" The potential rate reduction is a pivotal factor influencing the dollar, as precious metals are typically priced in US currency. Consequently, the diminishing value of the dollar renders gold more affordable for buyers utilizing other currencies.



Furthermore, the prospect of lower interest rates enhances gold's attractiveness relative to US Treasury bonds, another traditional safe-haven asset. Investors often turn to gold during periods of economic uncertainty, considering it a store of value. The inverse relationship between interest rates and gold prices comes into play, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.

Spot gold initially peaked at USD2,110 per ounce before slightly retracting to trade at USD2,090 by 11:45 GMT.



This surge in the value of the longstanding asset has persisted for two consecutive months, buoyed by investor demand for safe-havens due to worldwide uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, recession concerns, and anticipations of US Federal Reserve interest rate reductions.



The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that markets are now estimating a probability of over 50 percent for a US interest rate cut in the first quarter of 2024.



'The anticipated retreat in both the USDand interest rates across 2024 are key positive drivers for gold,' Heng Koon How, UOB's Chief of Markets Strategy, Global Economics as well as Markets Research, informed a US-based news agency. He predicted that by the conclusion of 2024, gold prices could reach USD2,200.



According to a recent survey conducted by the World Gold Council, over 20 percent of central banks plan to increase their gold reserves in the next 12 months. This shift is attributed to a growing pessimism regarding the US dollar as a reliable reserve asset.



Historically, investors have sought refuge in gold during times of market uncertainty, using it to hedge risks and preserve value. Bullion has maintained its status as a safe haven throughout millennia, proving itself during economic instability, stock market crises, military conflicts, and pandemics.

Huge crowds and busy shops were seen all across the country as people flocked to buy the yellow metal.

According to experts, one of the main reason why there has been an increase in sales is because of the expectation that prices will go higher.'We have seen a notable spike in sales in the recent past,' said Nishin Thaslim, Chairman of Nishka Jewelry.

'A significant contributing factor has been the rising trend of gold prices. The market dynamics, including an upward trajectory in gold prices, have created increased demand for our products. We have observed a slight decrease in the weights purchased whereas a drastic increase in the walk in customers. As investors and consumers seek to capitalize on the favourable market conditions, our offerings, which include gold-related products, have experienced heightened interest.'

Suresh Babu, General Manager at Zaiba Jewellers said that the company had seen increased sales across all its outlets in Dubai. He agreed that expectations of higher prices were one of the main driving factors for people to buy.'Experts say that prices could go up to $2400,' he said.'Usually towards the end of December, we see price spikes. So we are expecting that trend to continue. There might be some minor corrections in the short term but we do think the price will continue on an upward curve.'

""The price of gold has broken a significant milestone,"" he said. ""Investors find solace in gold as a safe haven. There might be a correction before the new year, but we expect the gold price to be higher in the coming weeks.

Tourist sales

Suresh pointed out that high sales is also due a higher number of tourists in the country.'Usually at this time of the year with improved weather, we see a lot of tourists coming to the country,' he said.'We have seen an influx of tourists coming into our shops as well.'

This was also observed by Rahul Sagar, Vice President of Shantilal Jewellers, who said their store has seen strong retail sales post Diwali.'I think many Indian tourists are back in Dubai, which is a great sign,' he said.'This time of the year is always busy as many tourists from around the world prefer to visit Dubai in December, with the weather being more pleasant at this time of the year.

The rally was triggered by statements made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which bolstered traders' confidence in the possibility of an early interest rate cut by the US central bank.



During his remarks on Friday, Powell emphasized that ""the risks of both insufficient and excessive monetary tightening have become more balanced."" However, he clarified that, at the current time, the Federal Reserve has no immediate plans to reduce interest rates. Despite this, market sentiment interpreted Powell's comments as leaning toward potential monetary easing.



Market expectations, as reflected in CME's FedWatch tool, now indicate a 70 percent likelihood of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve by March of the coming year. This outlook prompted a decline in the dollar index and 10-year Treasury yields, further contributing to the upward trajectory of gold prices.



Analysts are optimistic about the future of gold prices, anticipating continued highs into the next year. Factors cited for this positive outlook include geopolitical uncertainties, the potential vulnerability of the US dollar, and the likelihood of interest rate cuts. As gold maintains its status as a safe-haven asset, market dynamics suggest a favorable environment for the precious metal in the foreseeable future.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_2.jpg,False,@menafn,10.377176,f390677adc021c96bdf5e2c91f573a94

In instantaneous transactions, gold experienced a 0.2 percent increase, reaching USD2,023.39 per ounce. Similarly, US gold futures for February delivery also edged up by 0.2 percent, reaching USD2,041.



Matt Simpson, Chief Analyst at City Index, noted that the volatility in gold prices is likely to be restrained leading up to the release of the upcoming non-farm jobs data in the United States. The yellow metal had recently reached a record level of USD2,135.40 on Monday, fueled by growing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. However, it subsequently experienced a decline of over USD100 in the same session due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of the monetary policy easing.



Recent data revealed that job vacancies in the United States plummeted to the lowest level in over two and a half years in October. This decline suggests that the rising interest rates are dampening demand for labor. The dollar index concurrently fell by 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, following a recent two-week high, thereby making gold more affordable for holders of other currencies.



Attention is now directed toward the release of November non-farm payrolls data, scheduled for tomorrow, as it could offer additional insights into US interest rate expectations ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week.

The gold market, like other financial markets, was affected after a better-than-expected reading of US inflation. Recently, the price of the yellow metal had dropped since reaching a record level earlier this month. However, with a consistent decline in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), investors feel optimistic as this could lead to easing monetary policy conditions, which would be a boon for gold.

Recently, the price of the yellow metal has fallen since it reached a record high earlier this month, but with the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) falling steadily, investors are cheered as this could lead to easing monetary policy conditions, which would be a boon for gold.

In general, gold prices have fallen by more than 2% in the past week, but they are still up by more than 9% since the beginning of the year. Silver prices, the sister commodity to gold, have also risen above $23 per ounce. Also, Silver prices had been fallen by 7% in the past week and are also down by 4% since the beginning of the year.

Economically, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the US annual inflation rate dropped to 3.1% in November, down from 3.2% in October, matching consensus estimates. On a monthly basis, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose higher than expected at 0.1%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food components, remained unchanged at 4% on an annual basis. Finally, the Core Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3%, compared to 0.2% in October.

Therefore, the next inflation reading will be the Producer Price Index (PPI). As, the Producer prices and the core Producer Price Index are expected to remain steady. Overall, financial markets were mostly mixed due to the data as investors prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting on Wednesday. Mostly, traders are expecting a temporary pause in US interest rates, with the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates early next year.

Moreover, a recent survey conducted by the Federal Reserve for CNBC showed that the majority of economists, analysts, and strategists expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in June. Additionally, the chances of a soft landing are 47%, and the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 41%. Commenting on the anticipated event, John Rainding, Chief Economist at Brain Capital, wrote: ""The Federal Reserve needs to start mapping out interest rate cuts that may represent a more stringent policy because cuts will lag behind inflation declines and real interest rates will rise.""

US Treasury bond yields were mixed, with the 10-year bond yield remaining steady at 4.235%. The 2-year bond yield did not change at 4.727%, while the 30-year bond yields increased by one basis point to 4.34%. As is known, gold is sensitive to interest rate movements because it affects the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

For other metal commodity prices, copper futures remained steady at $3.775 per pound. Platinum futures did not change at $916.20 per ounce, while palladium futures rose to $969.00 per ounce Price Forecast and Analysis Today:

The continued strength of the US dollar will remain a negative pressure on the gold price (XAU/USD). Moreover, the stability below the support level of $1985 per ounce will increase the bears' control over the trend. According to the performance on the daily time frame chart below, the downward shift in the price of gold will strengthen if it moves towards the support levels of 1963 and 1945 dollars, respectively. At the same time, it is sufficient to push the technical indicators towards strong saturation levels for selling. From the last level, the purchase would be ideal. Thus, this will depend on the continued strength of the US dollar and the US Central Bank's signals towards further tightening. On the other hand, over the same time period, the return of the gold price towards the psychological resistance level of $2,000 per ounce will confirm that the bulls are determined to return the price of gold to its record levels.

The settlement saw gold futures prices decline by 1.55 percent, translating to a USD31.9 drop and settling at USD2,014.5 per ounce. This reversal marked the conclusion of a three-week streak of gains for gold, as it had recorded losses of 3.6 percent in the preceding week.



The shift in market dynamics was underscored by a noteworthy increase in the value of the dollar index, which rose by 0.45 percent to 104 points during trading, reaching 104.26 points at its peak. The surge in the dollar's strength played a significant role in influencing the retreat of gold prices.



Investors' sentiment, as reflected in the Fed Watch tool, indicated a notable adjustment in expectations regarding the timing of monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve. The preference for the commencement of such measures shifted to 49.6 percent for May, deviating from prior projections that suggested a rate cut at the March 2024 meeting.



The robust performance of the US economy in November further fueled the market sentiment. Non-farm job additions surpassed expectations, reaching 199,000 against an anticipated figure of 190,000. Concurrently, the unemployment rate declined from 3.9 percent to 3.7 percent, underscoring the positive momentum in the labor market. These factors collectively contributed to the retreat of gold prices as investors recalibrated their positions in response to the evolving economic landscape.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_ForexCommodities_16.jpg,False,@menafn,12.32006,1acd70ffbb23957f325a65e6a0da6cf6

Thus, this allowed the gold price XAU/USD to rebound sharply and quickly to the resistance levels of 2027 dollars and 2040 dollars per ounce at the time of writing the analysis. Moreover, before the announcement of the Federal Reserve's decisions, the gold price was exposed to profit-taking selling that pushed it towards the support level of 1973 dollars per ounce. Therefore, we had recommended at the time to buy gold from every downward level. With the continuation of global geopolitical tensions and the abandonment of the tightening path by the global central banks, this is a good environment for the recovery of gold prices.

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve left the key US interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the third time in a row. Also, its officials indicated that they expect to make cuts of a quarter of a point in the benchmark interest rate next year. Clearly, the Fed's message yesterday strongly indicated that it is done raising interest rates - after the fastest increases in four decades - and is close to cutting rates as early as next summer. Speaking at a news conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it was likely that Fed officials were done raising interest rates because of how steadily inflation had slowed.'Inflation is continuing to decline, and the Labor market is continuing to return to balance, so far so good,' Powell added, after the Federal Reserve's 19-member policy committee finished its latest meeting.

In Wall Street, investors celebrated the possibility of future interest rate cuts. Consequently, stock prices rose, and bond yields fell after the Federal Reserve issued its statement and Powell held his press conference. Nearby, Wednesday witnessed a significant shift in the expectations of the U.S. central bank regarding interest rates and the economy. Just two weeks ago, when Powell stated that it was ""premature"" to conclude that the Federal Reserve had finished raising the benchmark interest rate or to speculate about cuts in this rate.

Moreover, he indicated that the Fed is almost certainly done raising interest rates. Meanwhile, he admitted that officials discussed the possibility of lowering interest rates at their meeting. He also admitted that his warning, in a high-profile speech last year, that the'pain' of rising unemployment would accompany a sharp decline in inflation was overly pessimistic. Instead, US inflation slowed significantly towards the Fed's 2% target, even while unemployment remained at 3.7% and the pace of layoffs was low. Finally, Powell added that the Fed realizes that keeping interest rates high for too long, and waiting too long to lower them, could put the economy at risk Price Forecast and Analysis Today:

As we mentioned before, the return of the gold price XAU/USD to stability above the psychological resistance of 2000 dollars per ounce is a strong support for further bull dominance of the trend. At the same time preparing to return to the record levels, the closest of which is currently 2055 and 2080 dollars, respectively. therefore, if the weakness of the US dollar continues and the rest of the global central banks abandon the path of tightening monetary policy today. Concurrently, according to the performance on the daily chart below, the support level of 1985 dollars per ounce will remain the key to the start of bear dominance again.Today, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank will announce updates on their monetary policy. Finally, that's will be followed by the announcement of US retail sales figures.

Technically, the gains of the rebound this week reached the resistance level of $2,047 per ounce. Consequently, financial markets have been greatly affected by the change in the US central bank's policy in considering starting to cut interest rates next year. According to market performance, US stock indices in Wall Street have risen and are approaching their all-time highs amid hopes that the Bank of Japan's moves to keep interest rates easy for investors will be a preview for the rest of the world. According to trading, the S&P 500 index rose 0.4%, or only 0.8% less than the record it set nearly two years ago. Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 198 points, or 0.5%, from its all-time high. Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.4%.

On the individual stock performance front, Enphase Energy stock jumped 6.9% after the manufacturer of microinverters for the solar industry informed employees that it will cut 10% of its global workforce and make other streamlined changes. At the same time, shares of oil and gas companies also helped push the market higher after crude oil prices rose by approximately 1.7% to recover from some of the sharp declines witnessed in recent months.

Overseas stock markets showed mixed performance amid mostly quiet trading. On the other hand, Japan was an exception, with the Nikkei 225 index jumping by 1.4% after the Bank of Japan decided to keep the benchmark interest rate below zero. Clearly, it took this decision to encourage more borrowing and spending.

Overall, the S&P 500 is up about 15% since late October, with Wall Street hoping for a similar approach. With inflation falling from its peak two summers ago and the economy continuing to grow, expectations are growing that the Fed in 2024 will move away from its campaign to raise US interest rates significantly. For his part, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appeared to give a signal to such hopes last week when he did not strongly push against traders' expectations for several interest rate cuts next year. Generally, wall Street markets like low interest rates because they give a boost to investment prices and relieve pressure on the economy and financial system.

Furthermore, the hope is that the US Federal Reserve can achieve what was seen as a near-impossible cakewalk, by first controlling inflation through high interest rates and then lowering interest rates before pushing the economy into recession. Surely, the big moves in Wall Street indices make critics say that the rise seems exaggerated, and that stocks now look expensive compared to the profits that companies are making. For their part, more cautious investors also say that the number of interest rate cuts that traders expect for 2024 seems unlikely unless the US economy falls into a recession.

Meanwhile, Some Fed officials have appeared more cautious about the possibility of lowering interest rates since Powell's comments last week. On Friday, for example, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it was'too early to think' about whether to cut interest rates in March. However, markets were enthusiastic, with the S&P 500 coming off its seventh straight week of wins for the longest such streak in six years. In a demonstration of how voracious buyers are, clients at Bank of America pumped $6.4 billion more into US stocks last week than they pulled out.Gold Price Forecast and Analysis Today:

There is no change in my technical view that the stability of the gold price (XAU/USD) above the psychological resistance of $2000 per ounce still supports the strength of the general upward trend. Thus, the continued decline in the price of the US dollar will give the price of gold opportunities for more strength, and therefore the resistance levels for gold will be 2045, 2070, and 2085 dollars, respectively. Clearly, this is sufficient at the same time to push the technical indicators towards strong levels of saturation with buying. Therefore, selling operations to take profits are expected at any time. On the other hand, according to the performance on the daily chart, a return to the support level of $1985 per ounce will be important to start the bears' shift in a downward direction.

263,"Hey, Remember About Gold Price's Powerful Reversal?",MENAFN,2023-12-20 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107635124/Hey-Remember-About-Gold-Prices-Powerful-Reversal,menafn.com,"Gold price has been falling in today's pre-market trading, but... Given the recent (HUGE!) weekly reversal, does it really surprise anyone? <","(MENAFN- Investor Ideas) Gold price has been falling in today's pre-market trading, but... Given the recent (HUGE!) weekly reversal, does it really surprise anyone?

The Historical Context

Well, it might surprise those that easily forget what happened in the previous weeks and focus on just the day-to-day price swings, but the truth is that the context provided by previous weeks, months, and years (and the performance of other markets!) matters a lot.

I previously wrote about some details coming from the broader perspective and some from the immediate-term analysis, and all that remains true. The recent weekly reversal was so huge that its impact on the next weeks really needs to be kept in mind at all times. It's not likely that a daily price moves in any direction (especially that gold is lower today...) would invalidate the implications of the powerful weekly (!) reversal.

In case that massive reversal seems like a distant memory, here's a reminder of what happened.

Gold soared above $2,100 only to plunge to almost $2,000, and in happened on huge volume. This was the most profound weekly reversal in years. It was similar to the reversal that we saw in May 2023 and the one from March 2022, and they both started big declines.

The same is likely this time.

This means that this and last week's moves higher were just a small rebound before the decline's continuation.

This is particularly likely given the fact that both previous weekly reversals were followed by some kind of bounce before the decline really picked up pace. In 2022, it took several weeks before the second (lower) top formed, and in May 2023, the corrective upswing was over within a week. Right now, we're 1.5 weeks after the reversal, which means that the decline could start any day now.

Also, please note that in 2022, gold corrected over 50% of the initial decline before finishing the rebound, and in May 2023, gold corrected slightly over 61.8% of the initial decline before moving south. This means that the size of the rally that we just saw is nothing extraordinary. In particular, it doesn't mean that gold rallied so much that it invalidates the immensely bearish implications of the recent weekly reversal.

On a very short-term basis - the intraday basis - we see that silver just outperformed gold, which very often precedes sizable declines.

This means that the bearish indications come not just from the long-term charts but also from the very short-term ones.

What about the junior mining stocks? Didn't they rally too much recently to still be considered bearish?

No.

Analyzing Recent Trends

Please take a look at the areas that I marked with red rectangles. They mark important tops in the GDXJ ETF. In those cases, junior miners topped by first declining somewhat, then correcting, and then sliding without looking back. In two out of three cases, the second (final) top was below the initial one, and in the remaining case (in early 2022), the second (final) top, was slightly higher than the initial one.

So, is seeing the GDXJ close to the previous top (but still below it) a bullish game-changer? Absolutely not.

It's not even a game-changer when we zoom in.

The junior mining stocks simply moved to the upper border of its rising trend channel without breaking above it.

The previous highs provide resistance, so it's unlikely - especially given gold's weekly reversal! - that a really big and sustainable rally would materialize here.

Especially given what's happening in the USD Index.

And what's happening there is that we saw a comeback above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level based on this year's rally. This serves as the final confirmation that the bottom is indeed in.

The RSI at 30 indicated it, but the breakdown's invalidation confirms it. This bullish outlook (which is bearish for the precious metals market) is also confirmed by the USD Index's long-term chart, but I already wrote about it yesterday , so I don't want to repeat myself here.

Now, before summarizing, I'd like to touch on two markets that also provide extra context for the precious metals market: stocks and crude oil.

As you know, I'm commenting on the stock market every now and then, but I'm not providing trading indications for it specifically because that's not the area where I have the greatest experience. That's why I'm using stock market charts and USDX charts not for trading those assets but as supportive indications of the main analysis that I'm conducting on the precious metals and mining stock charts. There are others, for example, Paul Rejczak, who specialize in this (stock market) area.

Paul opened his long positions on Feb. 27, 2023 (with S&P 500 below 4,000) and is now considering closing them . I also think that stocks are extremely overbought here and, thus, likely to decline shortly, especially since they just approached their previous all-time high.

A decline in stocks is likely to trigger a decline also in junior mining stocks - that's the part of the precious metals market that is most linked with the performance of stocks. By the way, the fact that junior miners were weak relative to gold over the medium term despite the stock market's strong performance is simply another indication that the miners don't want to move higher, and that the recent rallies were simply counter-trend rallies, nothing more.

The rest of the precious metals market is likely to decline along with stocks, too (like they all declined in 2020, for example), but junior miners are likely to be affected to the greatest extent.

The above doesn't mean that all stocks would be likely to decline, though. This is the case as far as copper stocks are concerned, for example, but the situation in oil stocks is a bit different. They have their own specific technical set-up that could take them higher regardless of stock market's decline - Anna described it in advance in late November in her Oil Trading Alert.

So, yes, while I continue to think that the biggest trading opportunity is still in junior mining stocks, naturally, there are also other opportunities out there.

All in all, the outlook for the precious metals market remains strongly bearish and the potential for our current trading positions in junior mining stocks remains enormous.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/includes/img/logo.jpg,False,@menafn,11.756042,a31c44e0d31445a60daf9cf36f7fd7db

The significance of precise gold price forecasting is accentuated by its financial attributes, mirroring global economic conditions, market uncertainties, and investor risk aversion. However, predicting the gold price is challenging due to its inherent volatility, influenced by multiple factors, such as COVID-19, financial crises, geopolitical issues, and fluctuations in other metals and energy prices. These complexities often lead to non-stationary time series, rendering traditional time series modeling methods inadequate. Our paper presents a multi-objective optimization algorithm that refines the interval prediction framework with quantile regression deep learning in response to this issue. This framework comprehensively responds to gold's financial market dynamics and uncertainties with a screening process of various factors, including pandemic-related indices, geopolitical indices, the US dollar index, and prices of various commodities. The quantile regression deep-learning models optimized by multi-objective optimization algorithms deliver robust, interpretable, and highly accurate predictions for handling non-linear relationships and complex data structures and enhance the overall predictive performance. The results demonstrate that the QRBiLSTM model, optimized using the MOALO algorithm, delivers excellent forecasting performance. The composite indicator AIS reaches −15.6240 and −11.5581 at 90% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. This underscores the model's high forecasting accuracy and its potential to provide valuable insights for assessing future trends in gold prices. The deterministic and probabilistic forecasting framework for gold prices captures the market dynamics with the new pandemic index and comprehensively sets a new benchmark for predictive modeling in volatile market commodities like gold.


 










 


With its multifaceted roles, gold is a pivotal actor in the theatre of the global economy, having intricate interconnections with a spectrum of financial and macroeconomic elements [
1
,
2
]. It is a unique asset, with a repository of inherent value beyond its physical commodity aspect, and concurrently orchestrates vital financial and monetary functions within the economic framework [
3
]. Gold assumes a prominent position in the international reserves across various nations, augmenting its stature and underscoring its universal appeal and strategic significance. Embodied with a triad of characteristics, gold possesses monetary, commodity, and financial properties, outlining its distinctive presence in the economic landscape [
4
]. During the prevailing dynamism and uncertainties characterizing the global economic milieu, a compelling necessity arises to delve deeply into the strategic implications of gold resources. This involves cultivating a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms that drive the fluctuations in international gold prices, enhancing the precision in forecasting these prices' volatility, and bolstering strategies to safeguard national economic and financial security [
5
]. 
The price of gold, which has both commercial and financial attributes [
6
], is not only influenced by the US dollar exchange rate and the prices of other metals but also by epidemics, geopolitical risks, and other factors [
7
]. In financial markets, gold has long been regarded as a bastion of safety amidst turbulent times [
8
]. This phenomenon is particularly evident during crises when gold prices often experience significant fluctuations. For instance, during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, gold prices saw a notable rise as investors sought refuge from the volatility of traditional stock markets. Similarly, the prolonged duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has saturated the investment and business areas [
9
,
10
,
11
]. Owing to its substantial effects, governments globally have implemented a variety of urgent actions at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak [
12
]. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic at the start of 2020 triggered a sharp rise in gold prices, reflecting the uncertainty and economic instability that characterized the global landscape [
13
]. These examples underscore the sensitivity of gold prices to crisis events, highlighting its role as a 'safe-haven' asset during periods of economic and geopolitical distress. This trend offers a unique insight into investor behavior during crises and underscores the enduring value of gold in a diversified investment portfolio. Since the factors are coupled and interrelated, the price fluctuations of non-ferrous metals are highly irregular and non-linear, which makes accurate and robust price forecasting an arduous job [
14
].
In recent decades, various techniques have been devised to improve the precision of forecasting gold prices. However, most of these methods concentrate on point predictions. Traditional time series models [
15
], such as ARIMA, require data stationarity and may struggle with complex trends or seasonal patterns [
16
]. Machine learning and deep learning [
17
] have been extensively and successfully applied to the complexity and non-linearity of gold price data. Liu et al. (2017) [
18
] used the random forest (RF) algorithm to analyze the variables affecting the price of gold and to predict the price of gold. In addition, applying heuristic algorithms to optimize the model parameters is likewise an efficient way to boost the model performance. Weng et al. (2020) [
19
] proposed a Genetic Algorithm Regularized Online Extreme Learning Machine that can accurately predict the price of gold. Zakaria et al. (2019) [
20
] proposed the WOA-NN model using the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) [
21
] as an instructor for learning the multilayer perceptron neural networks, which outperforms the classical NN, particle swarm optimization-neural network [
22
], genetic algorithm-neural network [
23
] and ARIMA models.
All the above models' point forecasting performance diminishes under extreme uncertainty conditions [
24
]. In the face of the complex volatility of the gold price, it should not simply be set to a specific value but to a growth interval that allows more scope for dealing with future uncertainties [
25
]. In addition, interval forecasting can accurately measure the variability in forecasts due to uncertainty and determine a prediction interval at a certain level of significance that incorporates possible upper and lower bounds on the initial value. This approach provides fuller information and gives more credibility to the predictions [
26
]. Quantile regression (QR) has been introduced for deterministic and probabilistic range predictions [
27
]. Unlike ordinary regression, QR is highly sensitive and robust to outliers in the response variable. Also, it exhibits flexibility due to having no strict requirement for normality and homoscedasticity and offers a comprehensive view of the examined relationship with highly interpretable results. Due to its robustness to outliers and the straightforward interpretation of its output parameters through distribution evaluation, QR has become a powerful tool for interval prediction. 
QR and interval forecasting are methods with the advantage of parametric interpretability. However, they rely heavily on specific assumptions regarding how the data are generated. Utilizing learning techniques allows for a shift away from these models based heavily on assumptions, moving towards methods more driven by the actual data. These techniques can capture complex non-linear relationships and identify hidden patterns and interactions in data. Models based on neural networks have been utilized to simulate and predict gold prices [
28
]. Also, Yurtsever et al. (2019) [
29
] predicted the gold price using LSTM, bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) [
30
], and gated recurrent unit (GRU) [
31
] methods. These models can capture temporal dependencies in the data, learning patterns over sequences of inputs. However, these intense machine-learning models are frequently regarded as 'black boxes', which makes them challenging to interpret and comprehend. Integrating QR and machine-learning methods effectively offers enhanced predictive power, robustness to outliers, the ability to handle complex relationships, and improved interpretability. This fusion provides a comprehensive understanding of data patterns with superior interpretability, leading to more accurate and reliable models. Combination models are proficient at identifying complex patterns within sequential data. However, their predictive performance can be improved further by optimizing the coverage rate and width of the confidence intervals.
Prediction intervals play a crucial role in interval forecasting models, embodying optimal attributes when they satisfy two fundamental conditions. First, they should guarantee a dependable coverage rate for finite samples, and second, they should aspire to minimize the prediction interval width as much as possible [
32
]. Utilizing multi-objective optimization algorithms to optimize the prediction interval coverage rate and interval width concurrently enhances the precision and reliability of predictions. These algorithms facilitate a balanced trade-off by ensuring that the prediction intervals are neither excessively broad nor overly narrow, allowing for improved accuracy [
33
]. This approach fosters the development of prediction models that are both reliable and effective, catering optimally to the intrinsic complexities and variances within the data. 
This study proposes a novel comprehensive framework designed for forecasting the gold price, emphasizing the pivotal role of gold and its price sensitivity to various determinants such as epidemics, economic flux, and geopolitical uncertainties. The framework combines QR with advanced deep-learning models and further enhances these models using multi-objective optimization algorithms to enhance the prediction's reliability and resolution. Similarly, to other ensemble machine-learning algorithms, this forecasting approach achieves high levels of accuracy and stability but with limited interpretability. To this end, our study incorporates an epidemic index, a geopolitical index, and the US dollar index within the proposed forecasting framework, aiming to significantly enhance its interpretability and practical utility. Though these indices cover significant ground, it is essential to acknowledge that there are numerous other factors influencing gold price volatility that are not currently accounted for in our framework. Looking ahead, our model's feature selection module is designed to be adaptable and universal, enabling the incorporation of additional influential factors in future framework iterations. The forecasting framework demonstrates remarkable resilience and precision, highlighting its capacity to deliver dependable and actionable insights, which are invaluable for investors and policymakers. Also, it effectively captures the dynamic nature of the financial market, making it highly versatile and applicable across a broad spectrum of uses. Key contributions of this research are delineated as follows:
(1)
This research presents a robust method for accurate gold price prediction, which is essential due to gold's impact on global commodities and economic indicators like exchange rates. Our approach enhances financial forecasting and serves as an early warning system for potential economic crises. It offers valuable insights for understanding and managing market uncertainties.
(2)
Historical crises, with a notable example being the recent pandemic, heavily influence gold prices, highlighting the importance of carefully choosing index variables in predictive model construction for precise forecasts. This study introduces a variable selection method for accurate gold price prediction, accounting for the impact of crises like the recent pandemic. It effectively incorporates both 'hard' indicators (metal and energy prices) and 'soft' indicators (pandemic and geopolitical indices) using correlation analysis and economic principles. This approach improves the model's interpretability and relevance in economic contexts.
(3)
This approach combines QR and deep-learning models to achieve multivariate probability forecasting. It reaches a balance between interpretability and predictive power. This method enhances the definition of the dependent variable's distribution, significantly improving prediction accuracy.
(4)
A novel interval prediction framework proposes the combination of multi-objective optimization with quantile deep learning to forecast gold prices. It optimizes the convergence and width of prediction intervals for enhanced trustworthiness and precision. Experimental results highlight the improved predictive power of the two multi-objective optimization algorithms, leading to more reliable interval predictions.
The subsequent sections of this research are as follows: The probabilistic interval model, evaluation metrics, and MOOA used in this research are presented in

268,XAU/USD Gold Price: Gold On Track For Record,MENAFN,2023-12-28 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107664343/XAUUSD-Gold-Price-Gold-On-Track-For-Record,menafn.com,"As trading begins in the final week of 2023, the price of gold XAU/USD is on the rise as traders look to potential US interest rate cuts from the Fed","(MENAFN- Daily Forex) As trading begins in the final week of 2023, the price of gold XAU/USD is on the rise as traders look to potential US interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2024, which has weakened the US dollar. Overall, gold prices are trading near a record high, on track to post their first annual gain in three years. Moreover, data showing a slowdown in US inflationary pressures has bolstered expectations for multiple interest rate cuts in 2024.

Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list 1 Read full review Get Started Today, gold prices XAU/USD are holding around the resistance level of $2,069 per ounce.

Last week's report showed that the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of core inflation rose only slightly last month and – by one measure – even lagged behind the policymaker's target of 2%. As a result, swap markets now expect a greater than 80% chance of a US rate cut by March, which would be positive for non-interest-bearing assets like gold, although some Fed officials have pulled back from the prospect of early easing.

According to trading, the price of gold rose to $2,069 per ounce, after rising by 1.7% last week. Similarly, bullion prices closed at a record high of $2,072.22 on December 1. Also, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%. Silver and palladium prices rose, while platinum prices stabilized.

On another level, Wall Street market indices are coming out of their eighth consecutive week. With less than a week left in 2024, the S&P 500 is now up more than 24% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up more than 43%. Furthermore, investors were encouraged by reports that showed inflation was declining even as the economy appeared stronger than expected.

In general, the Federal Reserve is in an unenviable position, seeking to slow down the economy sufficiently by raising interest rates to curb inflation but not to the extent that it pushes the country into a recession. Principally, traders still bet that the US Federal Reserve will cut the main interest rate by at least 1.50 percentage points by the end of next year, according to data from the CME Group. Currently, the federal funds rate ranges between 5.25% and 5.50%, at its highest level in over two decades. Moreover, the Federal Reserve had earlier issued projections this month showing that policy makers expect to cut the federal funds rate several times next year, but it is likely to be only half of what Wall Street markets expect.Gold Price Forecast and Analysis Today:

There is no change in my technical outlook for the performance of the gold price XAU/USD as the overall trend remains bullish as long as it remains stable above the psychological resistance of $2000. As mentioned before, the continued weakness of the US dollar may give bulls the opportunity to move higher regardless of technical indicators moving towards overbought levels, aiming for the first predicted peak. Now, the focus is on levels of $2070 and $2085 per ounce. On the other hand, it is essential to consider the possibility of profit-taking selling operations at any time if sentiment towards the currently weak US dollar improves. Shortly, movements may remain within narrow ranges due to low liquidity during the annual holiday season.
