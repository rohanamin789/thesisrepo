Binance says its US affiliate licenses its exchange technology but maintains that they are independent businesses.The crypto industry has suffered a tumultuous 12 months, capped in November by the failure of marquee exchange FTX. The SEC's objection to Binance US's proposed deal with Voyager shows how authorities are stepping up oversight of the sector even as many of the industry's leading assets remain unregulated.The SEC said there was insufficient information to show how Binance US would 'consummate a transaction of this magnitude'. The regulator also noted insufficient detail about the nature of Binance US's business operations after the proposed acquisition, as well as about how the debtors intended to secure customer assets. The SEC said it expected Binance US's counsel to file an updated disclosure.A spokesperson for Binance US said a 'diligent review of the deal is to be expected and welcomed', and Binance US will work with the relevant parties to provide any requested information. 'We look forward to completing the transaction,' the spokesperson added.In a sign of how the crypto industry has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, outflows from the main global Binance exchange hit $6 billion in a matter of days last month. Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao has sought to reassure customers, saying there was 'no amount of withdrawals that would put [Binance] under pressure'.Accounting firm Mazars – which previously produced 'proof of reserves' reports for Binance – has also said it would pause its activity in the crypto sector due to 'the way these reports are understood by the public'.Industry participants are also keeping close tabs on the situation at crypto broker Genesis, which halted withdrawals at its lending unit in November. It said this week it needed more time to find a solution for its financial difficulties.The group owes customers of exchange Gemini – which used Genesis as a partner in its lending programme – some $900 million. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss accused Barry Silbert, chief executive of Genesis's parent company Digital Currency Group, of 'bad faith stall tactics' in an open letter on Monday. In response, Silbert said DCG had sought to communicate with Gemini in late December but had not received a response. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023",irishtimes.com,798,business,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/GAuHmBIHU-oADQ-Ch7uUWVOVN74=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/3WCOIIRYYDACT6VFTVP5OYMEEM.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,9.43869,1576494b8e9a0a2ac493f38400d57f50

It further mentioned that nearly two-thirds of Bitzlato's top receiving and sending counterparties are associated with darknet markets or scams. The order also called out Russia for being a haven for cybercriminals and the government using them for malicious purposes.However, as per Binance's spokesperson, 'Binance provided substantial assistance to international law enforcement partners in support of this investigation. This exemplifies Binance's commitment to working collaboratively with law enforcement partners worldwide.'Bitzlato's founder alleged involvement in financial crimeBitzlato, a little-known cryptocurrency exchange, has been shut down by the US authorities for allegedly processing $700 million in illicit funds.The US authorities have arrested its Russian co-founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, in Miami, for allegedly masking the proceeds of illegal gambling and drug deals worth over $700 million. 'Institutions that trade in cryptocurrency are not above the law and their owners are not beyond our reach,' US Attorney Breon Peace said at a press conference on Wednesday, announcing the arrest.Moreover, according to the filing, the defamed crypto platform was a ‘critical financial resource' for the Hydra dark web market, the largest and the longest-running such marketplace. Also, a Russia-based alleged crypto-Ponzi scheme called 'TheFiniko' was another top handler of Bitzlato's bitcoin. Further, Bitzlato has processed approximately $4.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions since 2018. Moreover, the prosecutors said that the crypto platform required minimal identification from its users, allowing it to become a ‘haven for criminal proceeds and funds intended for use in criminal activity.' It was also alleged that the firm was aware of the issues.

Binance vs WazirX: Ownership feud escalates as revealed in recent report By Nidhi Bhardwaj: As per the latest information, the ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance escalated. In the early hours of 26 January, Binance sent WazirX a letter requiring the Indian exchange to meet two demands by the end of this month, or risk Binance terminating its service agreement with WazirX by 3 February.Why did Binance take this action? In November 2019, Binance, in a blog post announced the acquisition of WaqirX. In August 2022, India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided properties related to Sameer Mhatre, a director of WazirX, and in a press release stated, 'WazirX actively assisted around 16 accused fintech companies in laundering the proceeds of crime using the crypto route. As a result, the government has frozen $8.1 million in funds held by WazirX.' Amid all this, Binance took action to distance itself from WazirX, and was amended to say 'the transaction was instead limited to an agreement to purchase certain assets and intellectual property.'On 5 August, Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao tweeted that 'Binance does not own any equity in Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX.' A spokesperson for Binance also said that,' Binance's ownership of WazirX was a lie'Quick thread on Binance and WazirX, and some incorrect reporting. Binance does not own any equity in Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX and established by the original founders. 1/4— CZ ðŸ'¶ Binance (@cz_binance) August 5, 2022 What Binance demands now? In the wake of this situation, Binance in the recent letter demanded WazirX to publish a written clarificatory statement by clearly nullifying the previous statement of Co-founder, Nischal Shetty on the Binance and WazirX deal. Binance further wants this Indian exchange company to remove all service mentions from its terms. On Friday, Zanmai Labs Pvt, which co-operates WazirX, responded to Binance's demands and said,'The demand letter was ‘unethical' and attempted to use media pressure and threats to force Zanmai into issuing false and misleading statements as clarifications.'The company further said, 'Zanmai has not made any false or misleading statements regarding Binance's role and responsibility in operating the WazirX platform, and Binance's control over WazirX's user assets.' Moreover, CEO of WazirX, Shetty refused to retract his prior statements that Binance had purchased the Indian exchange.To prove his point, Shetty attached a partially redacted email chain that began on 19 July, 2021, between Brian Schroder, the CEO of Binance US, and Tushar Patel, the vice president of finance at WazirX, about an amended share purchase agreement.Will it ruin their relationship even further? If WazirX doesn't comply with Binance's requests, this will effectively ruin their relationship, mentioned in the letter. Sources from both exchanges have said such an outcome would likely crush WazirX, which, according to the Indian exchange's proof-of-reserves report published on 11 January, stores 90 percent of user assets in Binance-controlled wallets.Binance further said, 'We could disable WazirX wallets on a tech level, but we can't/won't do that. And as much as debates we are enduring, we can't/won't hurt users.'

Binance decides to suspend the US bank dollar transfers from 8 February By Nidhi Bhardwaj: Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange platform on Monday announced to suspend the US dollar bank transfers from 8 February, confirmed in an official tweet. The current information by Binance does not clearly specify the reason behind the decision. From February 8th, we will temporarily suspend all USD bank transfers. Only a small proportion of our users will be impacted by this and we are working hard to restart the service as soon as possible.All other methods of buying and selling crypto remain unaffected.— Binance (@binance) February 6, 2023 What's more important to know? ""We are temporarily suspending USD bank transfers as of 8 February,"" a Binance spokesperson said, noting just 0.01% of monthly active users use USD bank transfers. ""Affected customers will be notified directly,"" the company mentioned.'In the interim, all other methods of buying and selling crypto remain unaffected, including bank transfer using one of the other fiat currencies supported by Binance, including euros, buying and selling crypto via credit card, debit card, Google Pay, and Apple Pay and via our Binance P2P marketplace,"" the spokesperson added.Binance US, a unit of the company that is regulated by the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said in a tweet that it's not affected by the suspension. This action also directed that only non-U.S. clients who transfer money to or from bank accounts in dollars are affected by the change.What happened following the announcement?Binance crypto wallets noticed a sharp spike in outflows, following the announcement from the company. The outflows from Binance crypto wallets to rival exchanges increased, suggested data from Arkham Intelligence, a crypto intelligence platform that provides information on market activity.

While directing this sum of money, data highlighted that this doesn't affect the company which has $42.2 billion worth of crypto assets. 'We're still overwhelmingly net-positive on net deposits even after the millions of dollars worth of crypto flowed out of Binance,' the spokesperson said. Moreover, as of (13:00 IST) Binance's exchange token, BNB, remained unaffected by the announcement, with its current price at $328.69, marking a 1.28 percent increase amid the announcement. Before this announcement, Binance had even introduced a tool to help users calculate the tax obligations on their crypto transactions. ""In one click, you can now import your Binance transactions into our calculator and obtain a simple yet comprehensive estimate of your tax obligations depending on your jurisdiction,"" Binance said on Monday.

By Jasmine Anand
: 
Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has announced the launch of an AI-powered NFT generator, known as 'Bicasso' in beta.


BICASSO first pilot just completed with 10K NFT minted in 2.5 hours. The AI was a little stressed out, but caught its breathe now. ðŸ˜‚ 
https://t.co/BBRevAdIUc

— CZ ðŸ'¶ Binance (@cz_binance) 
March 1, 2023
This new tool lets users turn words and images into digital collectibles using the power of AI. In fact, users have welcomed this tool and are getting creative with the same.
Interestingly, this NFT generator has been churning out digital art at full capacity, reaching a cap of 10,000 NFT mints in just 2.5 hours after launch. As per reports, approximately 3,300 users have minted at least one Bicasso NFT. The initial free mint is capped at 10,000 NFTs. Since the images were part of the pilot, they are not available for resale.
How to operate Bicasso?
Bicasso, which resembles the name of the renowned Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, can be operated quite easily. When prompted, users type in descriptive English words and provide an optional background photo. The AI then creates an image based on the information given to it and mints an NFT on the BNB Chain.
It is pointed out that this new AI tool is very similar to AI art platforms such as DALL-E or Midjourney.
Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, mentioned, 'You can turn your creative visions into NFTs with AI.' He further added, 'Give it a try and show me what you make with it.'
However, owing to high demand, Binance admitted a few flaws following the pilot launch of Bicasso. It stated, 'Our team is currently working to increase the server abilities to reduce errors and to make the minting process smoother.'
Further, the exchange has mentioned that those who missed out on the 10K beta quota can sign up for the waitlist for the full version.
As of now, no official release date has been revealed for the new AI-powered tool.

26,Cocos-BCX's L2 on BNB Chain built on OP Stack: The Key to Unlocking Web3 Gaming Potential?,Cocos-BCX,2023-02-28 00:00:00,date,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/28/2617551/0/en/Cocos-BCX-s-L2-on-BNB-Chain-built-on-OP-Stack-The-Key-to-Unlocking-Web3-Gaming-Potential.html,globenewswire.com,Cocos-BCX's L2 on BNB Chain built on OP Stack: The Key to Unlocking Web3 Gaming Potential?...,"New York, NY, Feb. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In response to the growing market, the gaming digital economy platform, Cocos-BCX, has announced a strategic partnership with NodeReal to establish the first game-centric Optimistic Rollup on the BNB Chain. This announcement has generated widespread attention and raised expectations for the development of Web3 gaming in 2023.
 
 
Cocos-BCX, a gaming digital economy platform focused on the gaming vertical, was established in 2018 and secured a 
$40 million
 investment from institutions such as Binance Labs and NEO Global Capital in the same year. Cocos-BCX chose the open-source engine of Cocos, a top global game development service provider, as its game development technology support. Leveraging Cocos engine with over 1.6 million developers worldwide and access to more than 1.6 billion end devices, Cocos-BCX is building an efficient bridge for traditional game developers to enter the Web3 space and is contributing a vital force to the growth of the Web3 gaming world.
 
A Key Selling Point: Analyzing the Potential of Web3 Gaming from the Perspective of Incremental User Growth
 
According to Nintendo's 2022 annual Switch Gaming user report, the total number of Switch users has surpassed 100 million, while Axie Infinity, a ""Web3 breaking-through"" blockchain game, has peaked with about 3 million daily active users.
 
Although there is a considerable difference in user volume between Web2 and Web3, this implies that billions of users are yet to be discovered in Web3. Gaming is the key to unlocking the potential of Web3 by tapping into Web2's vast user pool.
 
This is due to the fact that the global gaming player base has surpassed 3 billion in 2022, according to Newzoo data, forming a vast natural traffic pool that can provide a steady stream of new users for Web3 games. On the other hand, Web3 games exist on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, with decentralization, digital rights confirmation, permissionlessness, and composability features that are attractive to players, especially those whose game assets have been violated by the platform.
 
User enthusiasm for games has been fully reflected in Web3, with the total daily active wallet of on-chain games reaching 800,000 even in the bear market of 2022, accounting for nearly 50% of the total daily active wallets on the blockchain. Top industry VCs have also shown tremendous enthusiasm for Web3 games, hoping to become builders of killer hit games, leading not only Web3 out of the circle but also leading the transformation and development of the global gaming industry.
 
Cocos-BCX recognized the enormous development potential of GameFi as early as 2018, choosing to provide Web3 game-related services to the market based on the world's top game development service provider, Cocos. Its outstanding market performance has repeatedly been selected as an excellent project in the BNB Chain ecosystem.
 
Challenges in Web3 Gaming: Analyzing the Dilemma and Breakthroughs from a Technical Feasibility Perspective
 
Developing Web3 games is difficult because the current blockchain infrastructure cannot support high-quality game operations nor provide a smooth experience for a more extensive user base.
 
On the one hand, as the birthplace of GameFi, Ethereum games once created a glorious scene in the Web3 world. However, with the creation of more game projects and an influx of players, the network congestion, speed delays, and high gas costs caused by Ethereum's insufficient performance have become increasingly apparent. Ensuring normal operations, let alone an immersive game experience is impossible.
 
On the other hand, under limited performance support, developers have made profit-driven choices, and the narrative focus of games has shifted towards P2E. Compared to high-quality Web2 games, most Web3 games appear to be crudely made, and many times it feels like we are not playing games but rather participating in DeFi projects. This further reduces the experience of Web3 game players and causes a severe loss of Web3 game users.
 
How can games achieve both the high-quality production and smooth experience of Web2 while promoting the decentralized advantages of Web3?
 
To address this issue, Cocos-BCX has established a strategic partnership with Web3 infrastructure provider NodeReal to create a new development space for Web3 games by building the first game-centric Optimistic Rollup on BNB Chain.
 
Ethereum's inefficiency has triggered the new public chain war and the rise of L2:
 
While game-oriented public chains such as Wax and Flow have gained popularity among new public chains, BNB Chain, born under the support of the world's leading trading platform Binance, is undoubtedly the top choice. It has smart contract functionality and is compatible with Ethereum EVM, allowing developers to migrate their projects from Ethereum easily. Transaction processing speed is 35 times that of EVM, with transaction costs almost negligible.
 
Among L2 solutions, Optimism's adoption of the Optimistic Rollup architecture dramatically reduces costs and latency while ensuring security. In addition, Optimism's modular OP Stack is also a significant focus, as it builds a standardized open-source module and constructs a more expressive and precise Rollup chain.
 
The L2 built by Cocos-BCX and NodeReal is an existence that takes advantage of both the BNB Chain and Optimism. It is built on the open-source OP Stack and has benefits such as safety, low cost, and developer-friendliness. It aims to become a platform that focuses on the gaming field and constructs an open and interconnected ""super chain"" to bring the next billion users to Web3.
 
High performance and low gas fee are one of the core advantages of Cocos-BCX L2: Cocos-BCX L2 is the first game-centric Optimistic Rollup built on BNB Chain and can provide complete EVM equivalency at extremely low costs, with TPS exceeding 10K and gas reduced by 10-100 times.
 
Openness is an important goal of Cocos-BCX L2: Based on the modular framework of the open-source OP Stack, Cocos-BCX L2 will have strong scalability in the settlement, data validity, and execution, allowing simple and secure access to L1 and L2, and developers can easily set gas transactions for DApps through APIs to perform account abstractions and use easy-to-use bridging tools to construct multi-chain applications securely.
 
In addition, Cocos-BCX L2 will provide a series of easy-to-use development toolkits to help developers further reduce development barriers and more easily build game projects, making Cocos-BCX L2 a bridge to embrace the vast L1 and L2 ecosystem better.
 
 
Cocos-BCX Architecture
 
The Cocos-BCX L2, born from the combination of the strengths of BNB Chain and Optimism, is a developer-friendly gaming platform that offers a promising solution for high-performance, low-gas Web3 games. However, beyond technical performance, Web3 games face the challenge of high entry barriers. To address this issue, Cocos-BCX L2 also provides a range of solutions.
 
Pain Point: Analyzing the difficulty of acquiring incremental users due to entry barriers in user experience.
 
The high entry barriers are like a chasm between Web2 and Web3 users, making it difficult for someone who has never experienced Web3 games to get started. To play Web3 games, users must learn to use a wallet, create an account, protect their private keys, understand gas calculation mechanisms, and frequently sign authorization signatures. In the context of multi-chain development and the emergence of new narratives, concepts, and projects, many users are intimidated by these high entry barriers when venturing into the encrypted dark forest.
 
Cocos-BCX L2 aims to lower these entry barriers and attract Web2 game players with high-quality games, GameFi wealth effects, and NFT assets.
 
Reducing wallet usage barriers is the first step in lowering entry barriers for Web3 gaming experiences. Cocos-BCX L2 supports the social recovery wallet and MPC-based solutions essential for the widespread adoption of Web3. The social recovery wallet is easier to use and more secure than traditional wallet operations because it adds a wallet guardian. The MPC private key is calculated by multiple parties to avoid single-point accidents caused by the loss or theft of user-side private keys.
 
In the future, Cocos-BCX L2 plans to explore account abstraction to lower entry barriers and enhance the user experience. Using simple developer APIs, gas transactions can be set for DApps for account abstraction, and bridge connectors can be used to build multi-chain applications securely. This enables users to interact with the main network intuitively and achieve precise control over key account permissions.
 
Additionally, Cocos-BCX L2 is focusing on lowering deposit thresholds by integrating traditional Web2 payment methods. This will allow users to enjoy the same smooth interactions as when buying skins in King of Glory or clothes in Peace Elite.
 
Cocos-BCX L2 is built on the open-source OP Stack. It has a large, thriving, transparent, and efficient community consisting of top industry developers, making it an extremely valuable learning resource for developers. 
 
Cocos-BCX L2 will provide developers with a range of complete, practical, and easy-to-use tools, including social login/recovery, integrated Developer IDE, built-in NFT toolkit, VRF, etc. 
 
It also integrates high-performance decentralized storage solutions such as Arweave, Storj, and BNB Greenfield, making game development like building with practical tools, greatly lowering development barriers, and improving project building efficiency. 
 
Lastly, based on the game development service platform Cocos engine, Cocos-BCX developers can enjoy the powerful game development capabilities provided by Cocos engine, such as Cocos Creator, Cocos2D-X, and Cocos Runtime, which further lower the entry barriers and enhance game quality.
 
Blind Spot: Analyzing Cocos-BCX's Opportunities and Challenges in a Market Full of Unknowns.
 
In the highly competitive L2 market, people can see the active involvement of exchanges. For example, in addition to Cocos-BCX and NodeReal's collaboration on the BNB Chain to launch the first game-focused Optimistic Rollup, Coinbase announced the launch of its Base testnet, and Bybit also announced the incubation of an L2 project.
 
It's clear that top exchanges worldwide are keen to use L2 to enhance their market influence and share further. This also underscores the massive potential for L2 in the future.
 
In addition, as an Optimistic Rollup built on the BNB Chain, Cocos-BCX L2 can leverage the strengths of the BNB Chain:
 
On the one hand, Binance's large user base provides a wide user base for game projects built on Cocos-BCX L2, and developers can serve over 110 million verified users.
 
On the other hand, by accessing BNB Chain products, users, and tools, Cocos-BCX L2 can quickly build decentralized applications, seamlessly integrate with BNB Chain products, and access Binance's ecosystem of assets worth nearly 100 billion US dollars.
 
Cocos-BCX L2 has several advantages: high performance, low gas fees, and low entry barriers. By building projects on Cocos-BCX L2, developers can provide users with a smoother experience and start from a higher starting point. 
 
Additionally, Cocos-BCX has partnered with the game service platform Cocos, which has over 1.6 million developers. This gives developers access to a large, thriving game developer community with technology surpassing industry standards. For instance, Cocos2D-X is an open-source, stable, and customizable cross-platform game solution that provides C++, Lua, and JavaScript programming language interfaces. 
 
Cocos Creator, on the other hand, is an efficient, lightweight, free, and open-source cross-platform graphic engine and real-time 3D content creation platform, which can perfectly handle 2D and 3D game development work. 
 
Furthermore, Cocos has strong technical expertise in XR, virtual characters, metaverse, education, and other fields. These practical game services with high technical barriers are a key factor for developers to build high-quality Web3 games and establish Cocos-BCX's important position as the preferred platform for Web3 game developers.
 
With Cocos as strong support and Cocos-BCX L2 incubated in the BNB Chain ecosystem, it has the natural genes and muscular strength to become a game digital economy platform for both Web2 and Web3. Cocos-BCX L2 will continue working with a broader community based on BNB Chain products, users, and assets as seeds to establish a more open, innovative, and prosperous game community. Furthermore, welcome more game developers, enthusiasts, and practitioners to see the advantages of Cocos-BCX L2 and join the Cocos-BCX L2 to usher in the next round of the Web3 game revolution.
 
Conclusion
 
Looking ahead to 2023, the market has high expectations for Web3 games. The goal is to address performance and accessibility issues and create a high-quality, engaging Web3 game that truly showcases the benefits of the technology and attracts more users to the space.
 
Many players in the market are working in this direction and continuously improving the infrastructure. Among them, Cocos-BCX L2 stands out as an excellent platform built on the open-source OP Stack. With its security, low cost, and developer-friendly features, it aims to become a platform that focuses on gaming and builds an open and interconnected super chain, bringing the next billion users to Web3.
 
In summary, as a platform for hosting Web3 games, Cocos-BCX L2 is well-equipped and ready to face the Web3 game revolution.

DUBAI, UAE, /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of International Women's Day, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is renewing its commitment to increase the number of women active and employed in Web3. Through women-focused education and mentorship initiatives, Binance to date has invested more than $2 million to support women in more than 10 countries around the world and will increase those efforts in the year ahead.

Binance is committed to creating and funding Web3 education for women.

Binance Charity donated $2 million to fund over 36,000 dedicated Web3 scholarships for women in 2022, and will continue funding courses, programs and scholarships in 2023 with a focus on women and underrepresented communities. With women comprising only 37% of crypto owners [1], education is key to empowering more women to join the industry.

The 2022 scholarships to study blockchain and crypto-related courses at universities, schools and nonprofits were awarded to women in Germany, Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, France, South Africa, Australia, and Ukraine. In honor of International Women's Day, Binance Charity will also make an additional donation of $100,000 to Georgia's Innovation & Technology Agency (GITA) to support web3 education and training for women. Binance Academy will provide educational content for GITA web3 courses.

Binance is committed to increasing female representation in the workforce.

Binance was co-founded in 2017 by Yi He, making the company one of the few female-founder crypto companies in the world. Less than 5% of crypto founders at top crypto companies are women [2]. As of 2022, the number of female-founded cryptocurrency companies was approximately 292, out of more than 10,000 companies [3].

In order to further address the gender gap, Binance offers various early career programs, such as Binance Accelerator Program, and undergraduate internships which offer more access to careers in crypto for diverse talent. The company also offers guidance and career advice to women through female mentorship programs, talent workshops, educational courses and lectures to share industry experience and insights on how to break into a career in Web3.

""As one of the few female leaders in the industry, I believe that we have a mission, through Binance Charity and Binance Academy, to help more women understand web3 and blockchain technology -- our education and internship programs aim to empower young women with knowledge and skills ready for industry disruption,"" said Yi He, Binance co-founder and chief marketing officer. ""We believe that anyone with ideas can change the world, regardless of gender. We hope these commitments will result in more women on the front line of innovation and bring change to our industry.""

In addition to providing free crypto educational resources in more than 30 languages on Binance Academy, Binance will be waiving trading fees [4] through the month of March with code IWD2023 as an additional way to welcome new users to crypto.

Collective Finance
, a new decentralized finance (DeFi) project on the Binance Smart Chain, has announced the launch of its presale token event in which interested parties can acquire $CLF liquidity pool tokens at approximately a 10% discount. The upcoming public presale lowers the entry costs for investors looking to join the Collective Finance ecosystem through product discounts before the full launch of the project in April.
 
The project has raised funds from angel investors and is now opening a public presale. The minimum entry amount is $50, with no upper limit. A notable difference from other crypto fundraising and token generation events is that purchasers will receive liquidity tokens instead of just Collective Finance's native $CLF token. This unique approach allows users to participate in the ecosystem early, without the need for fresh capital injections or selling $CLF holdings to obtain $BTCB tokens for liquidity.
 
The $CLF/BTCB liquidity tokens will be airdropped directly to participating community members during the upcoming Collective Finance dApp and token launch. To enter the pre-sale just join
 the discord community
, and connect to the Collective Finance dApp, then click on the ""Presale"" tab.
 
In addition, there will also be an exclusive round of $CGLD presale edition NFTs up for grabs that investors can claim by depositing $1,000 or more in the presale and locking their position within the Collective Finance locked-staking platform (benchmarked against the total number of liquidity pool tokens created) in any of the available tiers within seven days. One limited-edition NFT is available per $1,000 invested and will be airdropped post-launch.
 
The funds raised will be used to create liquidity, purchasing assets backing $CGLD and funding the on-chain portfolio. The presale is open for up to $500,000 (hard cap), or two weeks. The public launch of the project is scheduled for early April.
 
According to the co-founder of Collective Finance 
Crypzom-Zachary: 
'Despite massive growth over the last few years, DeFi still trails traditional finance in many respects. In traditional finance, participants can hold and gain exposure to commodities such as gold, silver, and oil, but there are heavy restrictions, high fees, and limited ways to generate additional passive revenue from such investments. Collective Finance is here to deliver on that front by launching C-Tokens, which represent tradable, asset-backed, over-collateralized commodity with direct yield-earning potential. We can help get the ball rolling by providing widespread access and inclusion to our suite of products and services and our robust DeFi tools so that we can open multi-layered, yield-generating opportunities and provide exposure to digitized commodity representations to as many people as possible.'
 
Co-founder
 Doc-Bryan 
also commented on the announcement: 
'Our presale is just the first step in bringing our highly performant DeFi tools to the masses. The primary use case for all of our platform's C-TOKENS is to provide a liquidity solution for commodities in decentralized finance since obtaining consistent and reliable exposure to commodities in DeFi is virtually non-existent. With access to the right liquidity pools, product portfolios, and crypto-based representations of real-world commodities, the sky's the limit, and we're excited about the next phase of our project. Collective Finance is bridging important gaps between DeFi and Trad-Fi one giant leap at a time.'
 
Collective Finance has numerous commodity representations outlined in the project roadmap, but the first to be launched will be gold (via the acquisition of PAXG tokens on the Ethereum network) followed by the issuance of $CGLD on BSC. PAXG is an asset-backed token, with one token representing one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar. $CGLD will be over-collateralized at a rate of 105-110% at all times with PAXG while retaining its peg to the price of 1 gram of gold.

The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance, finds itself under intense scrutiny regarding its possible involvement in illegal activity.

Three United States senators have placed Binance under investigation in relation to potential sanctions evasion, money laundering and unlicensed money transmission.

In a letter to Binance's CEO, Changpeng Zhao, and its United States subsidiary Binance US, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen and Roger Marshall stated:

""Your companies' apparent attempts at evading the enforcement of anti-money laundering laws, securities laws, information reporting requirements, and other financial regulations cast serious doubt on the stability and legitimacy of Binance and its related entities, and on your commitment to your customers.""

As the world's biggest crypto exchange by volume, Binance has 120 million users worldwide. The senators have alleged that Binance enabled criminals and rogue states to conduct money laundering and sanctions evasion worth a total of at least $10 billion.

They state that it ""appears that money laundering is central to Binance's business strategy'' and cite moves by Mr Zhao ""to substantially weaken the platform's anti-money laundering controls, or do away with them completely"". These moves allegedly included efforts to recruit customers in seven countries deemed extreme money laundering risks, including Russia and Ukraine.

While Binance US is registered with the Treasury Department, Binance itself is unlicensed to operate in the US. The senators accuse Binance of evading US regulators by operating Binance US as a ""de facto subsidiary"". According to 2019 financial documents, Binance's Cayman Islands holding company holds Binance US customers' digital wallets.

The senators' letter notes that, since 2018, Binance has been investigated by the Department of Justice over money laundering conspiracy and criminal sanctions violations. The senators have asked Binance and its related companies to submit financial and internal documents and respond to the questions they have raised.

There is little doubt that this investigation will be of great concern to both Binance and its users. It is also likely that the entire cryptocurrency network will be anxiously waiting to see the eventual outcome.

Privately held crypto exchanges are setting new lows in corporate governance. If you thought the 
initial bankruptcy filing for Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX
 was stunning in what it revealed about how that company was run, check out the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commissions lawsuit against Binance
 today. Here's a business empire controlled by one person, Changpeng Zhao, which has no board of directors and no fixed headquarters. Its executives routinely discuss all sorts of business matters over Signal, 'with its auto-delete functionality enabled,' the complaint alleges, 'even after Binance received document requests from the CFTC.' You can figure out what that means. 
Even better: When a business partner wanted a compliance audit, Binance staffers hired someone they knew would do 'a half assed' job, the lawsuit says, citing an executive. And as part of the audit, another staffer discussed writing a 'fake' report for the nonexistent board of directors! None of this is the main point of the lawsuit, however. That would be the CFTC's contention that Binance deliberately lured American investors to use its platform despite its failure to register with U.S. authorities, as is required by law. (Binance in turn called the complaint 'unexpected and disappointing.') For more details of the lawsuit, see 
our report here

NEW YORK: The US arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance is struggling to find a bank to handle its customers' cash after the failure of Signature Bank last month
 
Previously, the deposits were sent to either Signature Bank or Silvergate Capital Corp, both seen as crypto-friendly banks. However, after both failed, the exchange is rushing to find a new banking partner, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), citing people familiar with the matter.
 
Binance.US is using at least one intermediary to store funds, the WSJ said, adding that since the money is being held by a third party, it can slow down sending and moving funds.
 
The company has unsuccessfully tried to establish relationships with Cross River Bank and Customers Bancorp Inc, the report said, adding that banks are reluctant due to concerns over regulatory risk.
 
All three companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment outside normal business hours.
 
'We work with multiple US-based banking and payment providers and continue to onboard new partners while upgrading our internal systems to create a more stable fiat platform and offer additional services,' a spokesperson for Binance.US told the WSJ. — Reuters",thestar.com.my,1823,news,MY,en,,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2023/04/10/2017749.JPG,False,,11.087212,aef6a724542629beac2799312e121c51

Mystery Trader's Debt-Ceiling Windfall Sparks Insider Concerns

US-China Handshake Fails to Stem Asia's Fear of Another Ukraine


Binance's payments partner in Australia had abruptly cut it off, meaning local customers couldn't deposit Aussie dollars on the platform via bank transfer. The hit to business was immediate, with Binance halting all Aussie trading pairs about two weeks later, along with bank withdrawals of the local currency.
Add one more headache to the swelling list of challenges facing Richard Teng, the civil servant-turned-crypto executive who's seen as a possible heir to Binance's embattled chief executive officer, billionaire Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao.
Teng has emerged as the frontrunner to take over as CEO should Zhao relinquish that position, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The succession issue has taken on additional urgency as US regulatory scrutiny of Binance mounted in recent months, the people said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and Zhao himself in late March for allegedly violating derivatives regulations, and accused it of having 'sham' compliance.
Binance didn't respond to requests for comment on succession. Zhao has disputed the characterization of many of the issues alleged by the CFTC.
Binance still handles more trading than all other top centralized crypto exchanges combined, yet never has its position seemed so precarious. At least four US federal agencies are investigating or bringing enforcement action against it, and regulators in Canada and Australia are looking into its business. Even Dubai, Zhao's adopted home and seen as a free-wheeling crypto hub, has tightened scrutiny of license applicants including Binance.
Two months before Binance Australia said payments-solution provider Cuscal had pulled support for Aussie dollar deposit services, a UK banking partner stopped providing support to the exchange for transactions in British pounds.
This is the bleak environment into which Teng, a 52-year-old Singaporean, has been thrust following a meteoritic rise in his less than two years at Binance. In late May, Zhao appointed him as head of all regional markets outside the US, which is run as a separate entity.
The apparent bet: Teng's resume, with senior positions at Singapore's central bank and Abu Dhabi's international free-trade zone, makes him the ideal candidate to help steer Binance through the regulatory hurricane bearing down on it.
Teng's appointment 'checks the boxes for trust,' said Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University. 'Binance is signaling that they want to work with the regulators.'
The CFTC lawsuit is perhaps the most imminent regulatory challenge for Binance, but it's far from the only one. The US Justice Department is investigating whether its platform was used illegally to let Russians skirt US sanctions and move money, Bloomberg News reported in early May.
Binance announced in May that it plans to exit Canada — two months after its local affiliate filed paperwork to commit to registration — citing new regulations that made the market 'no longer tenable' for it. It's currently locked in a dispute with the Ontario Securities Commission.
Read a timeline of Binance's history with regulators
Teng worked for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's central bank, for 13 years until 2007, according to his LinkedIn profile. After that, he was at the Singapore stock exchange, working as chief regulatory officer. Then came a six-year stint running Abu Dhabi Global Market. He has a Master's degree in applied finance from the University of Western Australia, his profile shows.
He joined Binance in August 2021 as Singapore CEO and, in Zhao's telling, his hiring was swift even by crypto's standards.
The two men were introduced by an employee at Singapore's central bank, Zhao said at Binance's weekly Twitter Spaces on May 31.
'They said look, this is Richard, he's a cool guy,' Zhao said. 'And so I talked to him. Within two weeks we reached a deal to hire him.'
Singapore Setback
One of Teng's first tasks was to help Binance secure a license in Singapore, at the time one of the most coveted seals of approval in crypto. 'That actually didn't work out, but Richard had done phenomenal work during that process,' Zhao said.
The application failed because Binance's affiliate didn't meet criteria for protecting against money laundering and terrorist financing, Bloomberg News reported in January 2022. Binance denied that at the time, saying it withdrew the application on strategic and commercial grounds.

The setback didn't appear to hurt Teng's prospects at Binance. In December 2021, he was promoted to head of the Middle East and North Africa, and was given oversight of Europe less than a year later, according to his LinkedIn profile. Just a month before receiving his current title, Asia was added to the regions under Teng's purview. He's now based in Dubai, where Binance has more than 500 employees.
On paper, at least, Teng cuts a very different figure to Zhao. He spent almost two decades in total working for government entities. At Singapore's stock exchange, he ran a group that enforces rules in areas including listings, trading and clearing, working closely with the MAS, his LinkedIn profile says.
580 Flight Hours
Zhao, meanwhile, had an itinerant lifestyle for years after starting Binance in China in 2017. He appears to have finally settled on Dubai as his home. In the past few years, his company has been the subject of an array of regulatory rebukes and probes from the US to Thailand. At times, Zhao struck a defiant tone in defending Binance, arguing that it's difficult to work with regulators who don't grasp the fundamentals of crypto.
The contrasts extend to how the two men express themselves publicly. Zhao, until recently a regular on the crypto-conference tour who's said he spent 580 hours in the air in 2022, often takes to Twitter to disparage news reports he dislikes (he has 8.4 million Twitter followers). His tweets regularly include crypto jargon like FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) and SAFU — a play on the word 'safe' that's an acronym for Binance's emergency reserve to protect customer assets.
Teng is more scripted, preferring to stick to corporate messaging about Binance's expansion in various regions and regulatory milestones.
Teng's rise has seen him join an inner circle of Zhao confidants that includes He Yi, Binance's other co-founder with whom Zhao has two children. In a recent interview, He, who oversees Binance's $9 billion venture capital arm, pointed to Teng's regulatory background when asked about his advance, but said other qualities played in as well.
'I think he is a very seasoned, professional manager,' she said. 'Since he joined Binance, his scope has been continually expanding, and we all like and recognize Richard.'
Teng's recent promotion isn't the only sign that Binance is gearing up for a period of increased regulatory scrutiny — one in part ushered in by the rapid demise last year of FTX, the crypto exchange that was seen by many as the most potent challenger to Binance's dominance. Zhao himself helped accelerate FTX's demise when he tweeted that Binance was offloading its native crypto token, called FTT.
Earlier this year, Binance hired former Gemini Trust Co. Chief Operating Officer Noah Perlman — whose resume also includes a six-year stint as global head of financial crimes at Morgan Stanley — to run its compliance operations. The company's compliance team has swelled to more than 750 people over the past two years, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann said in February.

Binance and its boss Changpeng Zhao have 'agreed to repatriate to the United States assets held for the benefit of customers of the Binance.US crypto trading platform,' the SEC said in its statement.
 
The regulator did not specify how many of Binance's US customers are affected, nor the value represented by these funds.
 
Earlier this month the SEC charged the crypto giant with securities law violations that it said amounted to 'an extensive web of deception' and 'calculated evasion of the law.'
 
Binance is alleged to have permitted US residents to trade, even though the platform is not registered in the United States as a securities exchange. The case also alleges the firm misused customer funds.
 
The SEC says it wants to keep US customer funds safe, adding that the court order also prohibits Binance and Zhao 'from spending corporate assets other than in the ordinary course of business.'
 
'Given that Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms' customers' assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets,' said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC's enforcement division, in the statement.
 
'Further, we ensured that US customers will be able to withdraw their assets from the platform while we work to resolve the alleged underlying misconduct and hold Zhao and the Binance entities accountable for their alleged securities law violations,' he said.
 
A Binance spokesperson told  that user 'funds have been and always will be safe and secure on all Binance-affiliated platforms.'
 
'Although we maintain that the SEC's request for emergency relief was entirely unwarranted, we are pleased that the disagreement over this request was resolved on mutually acceptable terms,' the spokesperson said via email.
 
The platform, created in Shanghai in 2017, has cornered much of the crypto-trading market, turning its globe-trotting founder Zhao into a billionaire.
 
But it has long been accused of facilitating money laundering, setting up complex structures to avoid regulation, and busting sanctions — claims it denies.
 
After the SEC announced the charges, Binance said earlier this month that it was halting US dollar deposits and encouraged clients to withdraw their dollars.

The SEC on June 5 sued Binance, its CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao and Binance.US's operator, alleging that Binance artificially inflated its trading volumes, diverted customer funds, failed to restrict U.S. customers from its platform and misled investors about its market surveillance controls.
The suit and one filed by the SEC the following day against major U.S. exchange Coinbase represented a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry by U.S. regulators.

Under the agreement, which does not resolve the SEC lawsuit, Binance.US will take steps to make sure that no Binance Holdings officials have access to private keys for its various wallets, hardware wallets or root access to Binance.US's Amazon Web Services tools, the court filings showed.
The SEC said in a statement released on Saturday that the emergency relief order secured for Binance.US customers will protect their assets and ensure that they can continue to withdraw those assets.
""Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms' customers' assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please... these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets,"" Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in the statement.
A Binance spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday: ""Although we maintain that the SEC's request for emergency relief was entirely unwarranted, we are pleased that the disagreement over this request was resolved on mutually acceptable terms. User funds have been and always will be safe and secure on all Binance-affiliated platforms.""
Under other provisions in the proposed agreement, Binance.US will create new crypto wallets to which the global exchange's employees have no access, provide additional information to the SEC and agree to an expedited discovery schedule, the filings said.
The U.S. affiliate of Binance halted dollar deposits last week and gave customers a deadline of June 13 to withdraw their dollar funds, after the SEC asked a court to freeze its assets.",Copyright(c) 2009 Chosun.com All rights reserved.,2615,news,KR,en,VOA News,https://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2023/06/19/2023061900493_0.jpg,False,@TheChosunilbo,8.292181,a7c3e3699b483b8c066afee151efdea3

June 26, 2023
 
 
Mailchain
, the communication layer for web3, has launched support for .bnb names as Web3 email addresses. This integration streamlines communication between users, projects, and software developers in the rapidly growing BNB Chain community. 
 
The BNB Chain community actively engages in building and deploying innovative decentralized applications (DApps), including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, blockchain-based games, and non-fungible token (NFT) projects and marketplaces. Without the addition of web3-native communication, developers struggle to foster stronger connections with their users and increase engagement. 
 
Web3 email presents a familiar, yet powerful way for users and developers to communicate. Using .bnb identities as email addresses within Mailchain's unified, web3 inbox, BNB Chain users and builders have a familiar and intuitive way to communicate securely, privately, and efficiently, peer-to-peer and project-to-community. With Mailchain, BNBChain users can now send and receive messages, notifications, and transaction information directly using their .bnb identities or wallet addresses. Mailchain's communication protocol ensures that messages are end-to-end encrypted by default, enabling seamless and secure communication. 
 
BNB Chain DApps can now deliver an enhanced web3 user experience: By leveraging the power of web3 email, Mailchain simplifies communication between BNB Chain users, enabling them to stay connected and informed effortlessly via a unified inbox. Builders can integrate the Mailchain SDK in a few lines of code, offering a cohesive user experience for communication from DApps. Because Mailchain is blockchain protocol-agnostic, it supports cross-chain sending between other blockchain network addresses. BNB Chain users can communicate outside their network, with other web3 blockchain addresses or identities. 
 
""We are thrilled to extend Mailchain's capabilities into the BNB Chain ecosystem,"" said Tim Boeckmann, CEO of Mailchain. ""The addition of .bnb names in Mailchain means BNB Chain users can now use their preferred web3 names to communicate. Using the Mailchain SDK, developers can now easily reach their users. In turn, users can keep up to date with their favorite projects and communities, both inside and outside the immediate BNB Chain community.' 
 
To start using .bnb Web3 email addresses with Mailchain, BNB Chain users can create an account

, or visit the 
Mailchain documentation
 for setup instructions. 
 
About Mailchain 
 
Mailchain is the communication layer for Web3. With one simple, elegant inbox, users can send and receive private mail using web3 identities and blockchain addresses. Application developers can directly communicate with users or build applications that use the open-source protocol using the Mailchain SDK.

he has experience with international securities, banking, and financial regulation cases.

in the meantime, judge amy jackson has referred magistrate judge faruqui binance.us's motion for a protective order.

binanceargues that the sec is exceeding the agreed-upon consent order, requests that the court prohibit depositions of binance.us' ceo and cfo, and rejects the sec's irrelevant demands.

binance is anxious to diminish the sec's sway over the digital asset industry.

coinbase, ripple, and binance have filed motions to dismiss their respective lawsuits, arguing that the sec and cftc are acting outside their regulatory supervision and authority.

investors in cryptocurrencies contend that the sec's enforcement actions have hurt them rather than protected them.

the prediction of former sec chief john reed stark that judge jackson will refer binance's request for a protective order to magistrate judge faruqui is accurate.

stark believes the judge will require binance to provide the sec with most of its requests. however, the judge may eliminate requests that are duplicative or excessively broad.

he believes doj litigation is imminent and that it will have the most significant impact on binance.

according to reports, the u.s. department of justice (doj) accuses binance of violating u.s. sanctions against russia. stark believes it is probable that the doj will file a lawsuit against binance.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-08/23/C_1b693image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.624653,9ffbda095bec3ee7ab49690e842d82d4

Unsurprisingly, memecoins during those years were outperforming the markets by a vast margin, and Dogecoin, from January 2021 to May 2021, rose 10,000%. Doge even made its way onto Saturday Night Live, with Elon Musk as the coin's biggest narrative pumper.
 
 
 
 
Since then, the possibility of replicating Doge's success has inspired countless memecoins to follow Doge's pathway in hopes of becoming the next memecoin to capture the world's attention.  
 
CockroachCoin is another meme-inspired Dogecoin-like cryptocurrency that's pursuing a mission to foster kindness, generosity, and positive social impact. CockroachCoin aims to be a fun and inclusive digital currency that can be used for various purposes such as tipping, making donations, learning, staking, and peer-to-peer transactions.
 
Inspiration Behind CockroachCoin's Function
 
The CockroachCoin team has over a decade of combined experience in the cryptocurrency industry, which has provided them with considerable knowledge of blockchain technology, a deep understanding of how crypto exchanges operate, and how to successfully conduct proper business development, customer support, and community management.  
 
Therefore, CockroachCoin strives to insert the philosophies and benefits of decentralized cryptocurrencies and blockchains into its inner workings and prospectus.
 
As a cryptocurrency, CockroachCoin doesn't want to only be a memecoin, it also wants to be an altcoin with utility. This is one reason why the founders chose to brand the coin as Cockroach Coin (or RoachCoin) because in realistic environments and in nature, the cockroach insect has a function.
 
So despite being frightening to many, especially to those with insect or pest phobias, the cockroach has certain symbolic similarities to humans and to the ethos of cryptocurrency and blockchain itself.
 
For example, cockroaches are social creatures that are adaptable to nearly all environments, and defiant in their desire for survival. Moreover, they're prolific in their ability to reproduce rapidly like humans and serve a function and purpose in the natural ecosystem such as recycling nutrients and contributing to the decomposition process, serving as a food source for many predators in the wild, aiding in nutrient recycling, and pollinating certain plants.
 
Therefore, CockroachCoin is attempting to create a cryptocurrency that can realize the positive properties of cockroaches and apply them to the world of finance and technology. For example, fostering a healthy financial system, creating an adaptable financial instrument that can defy the negative traits of TradFi, and serving as a resilient coin that can survive the nuclear winter that bear markets bring.
 
CockroachCoin's Token Dynamics & Future
 
The CockroachCoin token, ROACHCOIN, is a token on the Binance Smart Chain with a total supply of 300 million tokens. ROACHCOIN's tokenomic structure is as follows: 30% is allocated to the pre-sale, 15% is allocated to private sale, 15% is for liquidity, 12% is for marketing, 5% is for CEX listing and distribution, 3% dedicated to airdrops, and most importantly, 20% of the distribution is for a burning mechanism. In essence, ROACHCOIN will never increase its supply and will gradually experience deflation through burning mechanisms, of which 20% of the total tokens will be burned.
 
In the future, ROACHCOIN will be listed on multiple centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. In addition, the team will conduct airdrops, pre-sales, events, and community collaborations to decentralize the future roadmap of the coin.
 
About Cockroach Coin (ROACHCOIN)
 
ROACHCOIN is both a meme cryptocurrency coin and an altcoin that was inspired by Dogecoin and created as a lighthearted and entertaining alternative to Bitcoin. ROACHCOIN's total supply is 300 million tokens, of which 20% will be gradually burned through a burning mechanism. ROACHCOIN was created on the Binance Smart Chain.

The issue arose due to a significant pri","The issue arose due to a significant price disparity between Upbit and other exchanges for CYBER.

With the price of CYBER soaring, arbitrage users began to borrow CYBER for their trading strategies, leading to a surge of loan requests for CYBER that triggered the risk management protocol on Binance.

Consequently, new loan requests were suspended, and loan interest rates were substantially increased.

Despite maintaining a maximum borrowing limit as a buffer for redemptions, the astronomically high volume of redemption requests could not be met promptly.

Binance will dynamically alter loan interest rates and increase risk management measures to improve the user experience.

Binance has also announced that 887 affected users who failed to redeem their CYBER Simple Earn Flexible Products positions between August 29, 2023, at 00:00 (UTC) and September 5, 2023, at 00:00 (UTC) will receive a portion of 800,000 USDT tokens and 871 CYBER.

Simple Earn has earned a total of 871 CYBER since the introduction of CYBER products on its platform.

The distribution will be based on these users' daily average position in CYBER Simple Earn Flexible Products relative to the total magnitude of all eligible users' positions.

All other users who held CYBER Simple Earn Flexible Products positions during the aforementioned period will also receive an equal share from a total pool of 200,000 USDT worth of CyberConnect Foundation-sponsored CYBER Locked Trial Fund vouchers.

Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, attempted to minimize the significance of the changes in his company's workforce by referring to the news about them as FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), dismissing the reported figures as'way off,' and asserting that the exchange was still hiring.

Executive departures and layoffs have occurred amid increased regulatory scrutiny of Binance's operations in the United States, where the company has been embroiled in legal disputes with the securities and futures commissions, and in Europe, where it is facing investigations and has withdrawn from some markets.

Binance reportedly filed a court order against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC ) as part of their legal proceedings, alleging that the regulatory agency was conducting a broad and unfocused investigation.

The protective order, approved by the SEC, Binance, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, outlines the need to conceal sensitive information from public view.

As specified in the filed court document, this order requires both parties to preserve discovered evidence and materials, designating them as'Confidential' or'Highly Confidential – Attorneys Only.'

Consequently, any information classified as confidential or not intended for public disclosure must be regarded as protected material, with access restricted to the presiding judge, legal counsel, plaintiffs, defendants, and court-approved non-parties.

This is the most recent development in the SEC's complaint against Binance and its CEO, initiated in June 2023 with 13 charges, including allegations of unregistered securities sales by Binance entities and Changpeng Zhao .

In a previtwist, both the SEC and Binance opposed a petition submitted by a third-party entity named'Eeon,' which sought to intervene in the litigation on behalf of customers.

Binance has responded to the lawsuit by committing to defend its platform vigorously.

In a recent all-hands meeting, Binanceemployees were presented with three potential strategies to address the existing challenges.

The first option involves proceeding with planned growth initiatives, provided that Zhao resolves his regulatory issues with the SEC and either sells or transfers his Binanceshares to a confidential trust.

The second approach entails a moderate expense reduction, including sub-account functions and infrastructure optimization, while actively seeking new investments. However, the success of this approach depends on investor willingness to support the company in a bear market.

The third option includes a temporary'hibernation' period aimed at reducing costs while maintaining essential operations until there is a significant improvement in the situation at Binance.US. If Zhao successfully addresses regulatory concerns, the platform may resume its growth plans following hibernation.

In response to increasing regulatory pressure, Binancehas reduced staff by around 100 employees. Brian Shroder, the CEO, has stepped down, with Norman Reed, Chief Legal Officer, temporarily assuming leadership.

86,75% Of All Binance Fiat Trading Volume Is In Turkish Lira,Dalmas Ngetich,2023-09-15 00:00:21,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/binance-fiat-trading-volume-turkish-lira,newsbtc.com,"75% of all fiat volume in Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by client count, is dominated by the Turkish Lira (TRY)","75% of all fiat volume in Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by client count, is dominated by the Turkish Lira (TRY). At this rate, Kaiko, a blockchain analytics firm, confirms that the Turkish Lira is the most preferred currency, pointing to a shift in the global dynamics, especially regarding crypto adoption.

Turkish Lira Popular Fiat In Binance

As of September 14, 75% of all fiat volume was in Turkish Lira, ahead of the Euro and Brazilian Real (BRL). In the past three years, an unidentified cryptocurrency has gained popularity over traditional fiat currencies.

From 2021, TRY's use was among the lowest, with the Euro and BRL being popular. However, the trend changed in 2022 as adoption spiked, pushing the currency to the top in 2023.

When writing on September 14, Binance remains the most popular cryptocurrency exchange, supporting over 380 coins. At the same time, the crypto exchange supports over ten fiat currencies, of which other coins, besides those mentioned above, include the Nigerian Naira, GBP, and the Australian Dollar (AUD).

Looking at statistics, USDT, TUSD, and FUSD pairs are among the most liquid. This observation has been confirmed by Kaiko data, which shows that fiat trading on Binance had contracted by over 95% from 2021 when prices of top crypto assets peaked. By November 2021, Bitcoin prices had soared to nearly $70,000, lifting trading volumes in fiat and stablecoin pairs.

USDT And Stablecoins Still Reign Supreme

CoinMarketCap data reveals that the BTC/USDT pair is the most liquid, with the average daily trading volume exceeding $986 million when writing. On the other hand, the BTC/TUSD attracts over $486 million in trading volume.

This development highlights the level of liquidity of stablecoins and how they are entrenched in crypto trading. For example, the processing of fiat deposits or withdrawals on Binance can range from hours to days, depending on the method used.

Unlike fiat currencies, stablecoins are more fluid and can be transferred within seconds. For instance, USDT, the world's largest stablecoin by market cap, is available in over five blockchains, with Ethereum and Tron emerging as the most popular minting platforms.

Following the delisting of USDC, BUSD volumes spiked. However, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) directive, barring Paxos–the then issuer–from minting new tokens, saw activity shrink as USDT cemented its position. TUSD and FUSD activity on Binance remains high, as data shows.

A recent survey by KuCoin, a crypto exchange, reveals that over 50% of people in Turkey own crypto. The Turkish government has also been experimenting with a central bank digital currency (CBC), the Digital Lira.

Stepping in temporarily is Norman Reed,","The shake-up doesn't end with Shroder's exit . The firm has slashed about 100 roles, a substantial one-third of its employee base. Industry insiders are speculating if this strategic move addresses the heightened attention from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Shroder's exit has sent ripples across the crypto space. Many are pondering its significance. Could this signify a phased shutdown of Binance.US?

Popular crypto analyst Will Clemente voiced his perspective on X. He noted the U.S. subsidiary's noticeable decline, stating,'With a daily volume of roughly $15 million, the mounting regulatory burdens seem hardly justifiable for CZ/Binance.'

Echoing these sentiments, trading analyst Skew communicated his views to his vast 87,000-strong follower base. He suggested a foreseeable resolution to the SEC's ongoing case against Binance .'Given the circumstances, we might see federal charges or hefty penalties in the coming months,' Skew anticipated.

Yet, Adam Cochran offered a different angle. He highlighted Shroder's muted social media activity:'Schroder hasn't tweeted for eight months. So, what makes this departure noteworthy now?' Linking to potential indicators, Cochran connected dots between the recent downturn in crypto prices, last week's sealed filings by the SEC, and potential DoJ actions.

Earlier in June, the SEC initiated legal proceedings against Binanceand its chief, Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao. At the heart of the matter is an allegation. The regulatory body believes Binancemanipulated trading volumes. They purportedly did so by leveraging numeruser accounts tied to Sigma Chain, a Swiss-based trading entity under Zhao's control.

Binanceis undoubtedly at a crossroads, grappling with regulatory challenges and internal restructuring. As the situation unfolds, stakeholders and the crypto community await the platform's next move.

90,CRV Spikes 22% In 2 Weeks As Whale Withdraws From Binance,Dalmas Ngetich,2023-09-23 00:00:35,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi/curve-finance-crv-spikes-whale-withdraws-from-binance,newsbtc.com,"CRV prices are recovering and a whale is actively supplying liquidity on Curve Finance, moving tokens from Binance.","CRV, the native currency of Curve Finance, the decentralized exchange focused on stablecoins, is shaking off August's weakness and printing higher highs when writing on September 22. Trackers reveal that CRV is up 22% in the past two weeks, adding 10% in the last week alone.

Coincidentally, there has been increased activity from a whale moving CRV from Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by client count.

Whale Offloads CRV From Binance To Curve Finance

According to The Data Nerd, a tracker, a whale transferred 1.542 million CRV, worth roughly $684,000, from Binance. Afterward, the whale, only identified as '0x171,' added liquidity to Curve Finance.

Over the last week, the whale has been actively supplying liquidity to Curve Finance, providing 5.36 million CRV worth $2.27 million.

CRV is the governance token in CurveDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Curve Finance. Since the exchange is decentralized, CRV holders have voting rights. Moreover, they can receive rewards whenever they supply liquidity to any of Curve Finance's pools.

Curve Finance used an automated market maker (AMM) model for the trustless swapping of stablecoins, including DAI, USDT, USDC, and other tokens like ETH and wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). However, to function optimally, Curve Finance relies on liquidity pools where users can supply liquidity and get a share of fees distributed in CRV.

The withdrawal of coins from Binance to a non-custodial wallet is a vote of confidence for CRV. The token has been free-falling in Q3 2023. To illustrate, CRV crashed by 32% in August alone.

The draw-down was worsened by the broader contraction in crypto occasioned by waning momentum around the approval of several complex derivatives for Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, regulatory actions, especially from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), significantly impacted sentiment and token prices.

CRV Sold Off After Hack

The free-fall of CRV can be directly pinned to an exploit of multiple Curve Finance liquidity pools in late July 2023. In a re-entrancy attack, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the older version of a Vyper compiler, draining over $61 million worth of tokens from Curve Finance's pools.

Through the re-entrancy attack, the hacker could infinitely withdraw deposited tokens from Curve Finance's pools, resulting in losses.

Curve Finance has since patched the vulnerability, but CRV prices are yet to recover despite the recent pump. Also, its co-founder and CEO, Michael Egorov, had to liquidate a big chunk of CRV that he had used to secure loans on multiple platforms, including Aave.

By early August, Egorov had sold 106 million CRV via over-the-counter (OTC) trades at a discount to multiple entities. Top buyers included Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, who bought 2 million CRV, and Jeffrey Huang, who acquired 3.75 million CRV.

91,This Binance Wallet Triggered A Temporary 30X Surge In Ethereum Gas Fees,Opeyemi Sule,2023-09-22 00:00:49,date,https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/this-binance-wallet-triggered-a-temporary-30x-surge-in-ethereum-gas-fees/,newsbtc.com,"A crypto wallet associated with Binance has seen massive activity in the last 24 hours, leading to abnormally high gas fee on Ethereum.","A cryptocurrency wallet associated with the prominent trading platform, Binance, has seen massive activity in the last 24 hours, leading to abnormally high transaction fees on the Ethereum network.


Binance Wallet Incurs Nearly $850,000 Gas Fees In One Day


A crypto wallet labeled 'Binance 14' witnessed a significant transaction surge on September 21, rising above 140,000. 
As a result of this activity surge, transactions of the Binance-owned wallet consistently incurred gas fees of over 300 gwei, even though the network's average fee was around 10 gwei.


This gas fee jump and significant wallet activity 
have resulted in around 530 ETH
 (equivalent to nearly $850,000) in gas used on the Binance 14 address today. 
 
The increase in transactions on the Binance wallet had a broader, albeit temporary, impact on the Ethereum network. Gas fees on the blockchain momentarily jumped from less than 10 gwei to above 330 gwei per transaction, according to blockchain data tracker 
Etherscan
.


Gas fees refer to the cost blockchain users incur or pay validators to conduct transactions or execute contracts on the Ethereum network. Fees depend on the blockchain's demand and supply of processing power. This means when a network has many transactions, there is often a high demand for processing power, which increases gas fees.


Possible Reasons For The Gas Fee Spike


In the wake of this incident, Wu Blockchain reported that Binance said it was carrying out its wallet aggregation process when the gas fees were low to facilitate withdrawals and ensure the safety of user funds. Nonetheless, some prominent crypto community members have weighed in on the situation, offering possible explanations for the gas fee spike. 


Martin Koppelmann, cofounder of the Gnosis chain, 
said on the X
 (formerly Twitter) platform that Binance might be using a 'really inefficient script' to consolidate, leading to high transaction costs.




Gas prizes spiking because of a ton of regular ETH transfers related to Binance.a) they are using a really inefficient script to consolidate funds and are massively overpaying transaction costs
b) something fishy is going on


— Martin Köppelmann 🦉💳 (@koeppelmann) 
September 21, 2023
 
Blockchain analysts at Scopescan 
gave a similar prognosis
 on the gas incident. The on-chain analytics platform said:


Due to Binance consolidating funds from long-inactive deposit addresses, the Ethereum network is experiencing congestion, causing Gas fees to surge to 300 gwei.
 
Adam Cochran, a popular crypto investor, suggested that the abnormally high transaction fees might have been due to Binance's subpar APIs. In 
his X post
, Cochran criticized the exchange's technological infrastructure while casting doubts on its capacity to safe-keep 'hundreds of billions in coins across multiple protocols.'


According to 
CoinGecko data
, the price of Ethereum currently sits below $1,600, reflecting a 2.8% decline in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, Ether maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $190 billion.

To ensur","(MENAFN- PR Newswire) DUBAI, UAE, Sept. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Binance has entered into an agreement to sell the entirety of its Russia business to CommEX ( ). To ensure a smooth process for existing Russian users, the off-boarding process will take up to one year. All assets of existing Russian users are safe and securely protected.

""As we look toward the future, we recognise that operating in Russia is not compatible with Binance's compliance strategy,"" said Noah Perlman, Binance's Chief Compliance Officer. ""We remain confident in the long-term growth of the web3 industry around the world and will focus our energy on the 100+ other countries in which we operate.""

There will be an orderly process for the migration of users. Binance and CommEX will partner to inform users how to migrate their assets to CommEX. A portion of Russian KYC'd new user registration will immediately be redirected to CommEX and will scale up over time. Over the next several months, Binance will sunset all exchange services and business lines in Russia. Every effort will be made to maintain a smooth user experience during this transition.

While financial details of the deal will not be disclosed, it is important to note that with this sale, Binance fully exits Russia. Unlike similar deals from international companies in Russia, Binance will have no ongoing revenue split from the sale, nor does it maintain any option to buy back shares in the business.

Cryptocurrency firm Binance said on Wednesday it was selling its Russia business, months after reports suggested US authorities were investigating possible sanctions violations.

Bloomberg reported in May that the US Department of Justice was looking into claims Russians had used Binance to skirt US sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

The firm, which has faced severe regulatory hurdles across the world, has previously denied breaking sanctions but in a statement on Wednesday said it was making a ""full exit"" from the Russian market.

""As we look toward the future, we recognise that operating in Russia is not compatible with Binance's compliance strategy,"" chief compliance officer Noah Perlman said in a statement.

The firm said the process would take a year to complete and would involve selling its assets to CommEX, a company that only launched on Tuesday.

- Iran controversy -

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, reacting to the Binance deal, CommEX said: ""A hearty welcome to our new users from Russia and around the world!""

CommEX has a website and channels on the Telegram messaging app in Russian and English, but its representatives on Telegram deflected questions from users about its ownership and where it was based.

The firm did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.

Binance runs crypto exchanges and provides other services across the world but it has taken a severe hit since crypto markets collapsed and regulators began probing the legality of its business.

In November last year, the firm admitted its exchange had ""interacted"" with ""bad actors"" in Iran after Reuters reports alleged it had helped move billions of dollars in defiance of US sanctions.

This strategic shift is attributed to Binance's commitment to aligning with its compliance strategy, which necessitated the exit from Russia. The company emphasized that this move was a forward-looking step, acknowledging that its ongoing presence in Russia was not in line with its compliance objectives.



To ensure a seamless transition for its existing user base in Russia, Binance has outlined a meticulous off-boarding process that is expected to span up to one year. During this transition period, Binance will progressively phase out all exchange services and business activities that it had been conducting in Russia. The company is dedicated to ensuring that its users in Russia are not inconvenienced during this transitional phase.

Cryptocurrency market data provider Kaiko research analyst Dessislava Ianeva pointed out that the recorded fall is the second-largest monthly decline since April.

""BTC trade volumes on Binance are down 48 per cent in Sept, the second-largest monthly decline since April. Both drops coincided with the removal of zero fees for the largest BTC trading pairs. However, this time, the decline seems to align more closely with the broad market,"" Ianeva posted on X on Friday.

Users left the exchange in April after it cancelled the trading incentives associated with its Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin due to regulatory issues.

The exchange's trading volume had dropped by nearly 70 per cent during the second quarter at the time.

A similar situation occurred earlier this month when the exchange discontinued the zero-trading-fee incentives for its TrueUSD (TUSD) and BTC trading pairs, causing traders to migrate to other platforms.

While the removal of free trading incentives contributed to Binance's declining volume, the exchange has also faced increased regulatory issues in various jurisdictions, including the US and Europe, which has harmed its overall market share.

US regulators sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao in June this year for allegedly operating a ""web of deception"" and filed 13 charges in a federal court.

Binance was also ordered by Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) to immediately cease all offers of virtual currency services in the country.

Several crypto companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in recent months like Genesis Global Trading (a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), FTX, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager.

InQubeta showcases how impactful decentralized finance projects can be as it opens up artificial intelligence (AI) investments with smart contracts, ERC20 coins (commonly called non-fungible tokens), and an Ethereum-based blockchain. It skirts the obstacles that make it almost impossible for a large portion of the global population to use traditional investment services. With InQubeta, anyone with a debit/credit card or a cryptocurrency wallet can buy equity in AI startups on its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.

Meanwhile, Binance recently partnered with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to develop a new stablecoin based on multiple currencies. The currency will be developed on the Progmat Coin platform, which was developed by MUFG. The platform meets Japan's rigorous regulations for the issuance and management of stablecoins.

Top DeFi projects to invest in: InQubeta ($QUBE) outpaces $UNI

Investors who join the $QUBE presale during its beta stage are close to doubling their investment and newcomers can still enjoy 3x returns before the event ends. Over $3.3 million has been raised so far as investors scurry to attach themselves to the first cryptocurrency project that has the potential to be a major player as the artificial intelligence revolution unfolds.

Artificial intelligence has come a long way since the days when it was no more than a cool concept showcased in popular sci-fi media. These days, AI concepts many people never expected to materialize are now a reality. Driverless taxi cabs now carry fares in cities like San Francisco and Tesla recently demoed its Optimus humanoid robot performing tasks like sorting different objects autonomously.

There's no question about it; AI is about to transform the world in ways many of us have never imagined. It will disrupt almost every existing industry, creating opportunities for savvy investors to walk away with substantial profits. Thanks to InQubeta, it's now easier than ever to gain access to these opportunities.

A new way to invest

There are no hurdles to jump over when investing in the InQubeta network. Anyone with a crypto wallet or a credit/debit card can invest by buying $QUBE. The project's native token is used to buy equity-based NFTs sold by AI startups looking for funding. Investors acquire part ownership of these companies by buying their NFTs, which serve as stocks, on the InQubeta marketplace with $QUBE.

The value of ERC20 coins purchased can be monitored in each investor's InQubeta account and traded on the marketplace whenever they wish.

Investing directly in the project by holding or staking $QUBE could earn investors as much as investing in AI startups does. A 1.5 billion $QUBE cap and burn protocols encourage the long-term price of $QUBE.

Binance and MUFJ collaborate on new stablecoin

The new stablecoin being developed by Binance and MUFJ will be tied to the Japanese yen and incorporate other currencies like the U.S. dollar. This will allow users to use the stablecoin to carry out transactions in multiple currencies.

A new stablecoin could end up playing a major role in Binance's partnership with the Japanese market. It will also help to diversify Japanese financial services.

Summary

InQubeta is one of the best DeFi projects launched this year and its presale has emerged as one of the most lucrative opportunities. Some analysts have $QUBE prices growing by as much as 100x once launched as it funnels capital to AI startups by making it easier to invest in the technology.

Binance Square
. The rebranding reflects the evolution of the platform from a content aggregator into a dynamic social platform equipped with user-generated content.
With the newly added feature, Binance users in most markets can now actively participate in discussions and generate their own content on Binance Square.
The platform has also introduced a unique monetization feature that benefits both creators and users. Creators can earn from content contributions through tipping, while users can receive incentives via crypto boxes and an affiliate commission program. Binance Square has further plans to enhance these monetization features and expand its offerings in the future.
Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO and Founder of Binance, stated: ""Binance Square's goal is to build a community-centric social platform, and today's announcement is a step towards that mission.""CZ emphasized the platform's role in fostering knowledge sharing within the Web3 and crypto sectors.
Binance Square, previously Binance Feed, has so far hosted trending topics related to the crypto and Web3 ecosystem, with over 30,000 hashtags and more than 10 million monthly active users. It serves as a hub for thought leaders, influencers, crypto enthusiasts, developers, and projects to engage in current news, trends, and issues.
""Binance Square is a promising prototype of what blockchain-based social platforms can offer users and creators. The platform aims to resolve issues such as spam, fraud, and authentication.

selling all assets of its Russian branch

to a company that was established only days before the transaction. Binance's troubles began in June when

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit

against the exchange, alleging violations of securities laws. The SEC accused Binance of engaging in unregistered sales and offers of securities and misleading potential investors about controls and surveillance over manipulative trading.

The lawsuit triggered a major investigation into the company's activities, and in September,

the SEC criticized Binance

for its lack of cooperation with federal regulators, leading to further scrutiny.

Despite Binance's claims that the lawsuit is part of a broader federal crackdown on cryptocurrencies, the company has faced increasing challenges. Binance U.S. CEO Brian Shroder

resigned in September , and significant layoffs followed, affecting nearly one-third of the company's employees. This upheaval, combined with the requirement for American customers to use Binance to comply with regulators and the discontinuation of

USD support

on the platform, has jeopardized Binance's presence in the U.S. market.

The most significant shock came on Sept. 27, 2023, when

Binance announced

the sale of all business and exchange operations in Russia to a newly established company called CommEX. The move raised concerns, with

some speculating

that the two companies are connected.

Binance cited a DOJ investigation into sanctions violations as the reason for the sale but

denied ownership of CommEX . Despite this, many former Binance employees transitioned to CommEX, and the exchange has assured Russian users that their assets are safe.

Binance's withdrawal from the Russian market, a significant player in the global crypto scene, suggests significant disruptions to its operations and potential legal concerns. If the DOJ continues its probe into CommEX's legitimacy, Binance may face additional legal challenges.

Following the sale announcement, Binance received some support from industry players, including Circle Internet Financial Ltd. and Paradigm Operations, which filed

amicus briefs

in support of Binance's lawsuit dismissal. However, it remains uncertain if this support will deter the SEC's actions.

In further setbacks, a

class-action civil suit

was filed Oct. 3, 2023, against Binance and its subsidiaries, specifically naming CEO Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit aims to secure compensation for damages to businesses affected by Binance's actions.

Despite these legal battles, the most concerning development for Binance is the decline of its stablecoin, BUSD. Binance announced the cessation of all lending and borrowing in BUSD, a stablecoin that had a peak market capitalization of $23 billion in 2022 but has since plummeted to just over $2 billion.

The future of Binance remains uncertain, with questions about its continued existence or resurgence. However, bitcoin itself appears to remain resilient despite the turmoil surrounding Binance, underscoring the global nature of the crypto industry and its independence from any single exchange. Other actors like

HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: HIVE) (TSX.V: HIVE)

are also weathering the headwinds battering the crypto industry.

Dubai, UAE, 6th October 2023, ZEX PR WIRE , Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, according to Bader Kalooti , Regional Director of Growth and Operations at Binance, the largest cryptocurrency in the world.'Web3 and blockchain have proven a powerful solution to drive efficiency, transfer value more effectively, and add a layer of trust, transparency, and immutability to any sector, not just finance. I am very bullish personally.'

Kalooti was a guest on the MENA Surge Podcast hosted by Steven Besse on September 23, the ultimate source for all things Web3 and fintech related in the MENA region. The podcast is powered by Future Blockchain Summit taking place in Dubai Harbor from October 15 to 18, alongside Expand North Star and Fintech Surge and in association with GITEX GLOBAL.

'It has been very exciting to be part of that story and bring Web3 into MENA. And it is not just an element of 'copy and paste' anymore. It is a new paradigm whereby we are actually innovating a new technological trend from this region,' said Kalooti.

A challenge in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space remains a lack of awareness and knowledge, which translates into skepticism and uncertainty on the part of many potential users.'With the emergence of any new technology, there is a tendency for it to be quite esoteric, meaning that a very small percentage of the population will relate to that new technology. Therefore, education plays an instrumental role to drive mass adoption,' said Kalooti.

Binance recently launched a curated crash course called 'Blockchain for Everyone', translated into Arabic, that presents the fundamentals of Web3 in an easily digestible manner. Attendees who complete the course are presented with an NFT certificate.

Kalooti stressed it is important to distinguish between novice versus expert cryptocurrency users. Catering to both ends of the spectrum, Binance Light allows new users to be onboarded and navigate the product offering, while Binance Pro is a feature-rich platform catering for more sophisticated investors.

Looking at Dubai in particular and what has established it as the global 'crypto hub', Kalooti points to the global liquidity cycle as an important short-term driver.'That is highly volatile,' he acknowledged. However, over the long term, it is driven by network adoption and regulations. An entrepreneur will come up with a new idea but have to establish a product market fit in an ambiguous environment where the rules are unclear, a typical 'Wild West' scenario. After a certain level of scale, the regulator steps in to play catch up and establish the rules of the game.

Far from replacing Web2, Kalooti emphasized that Web3 wields the benefits of blockchain to improve efficiency and productivity.'That is an area where we see a lot of opportunity for use cases. It is important to understand that young talent is flocking towards the space. And there is a lot of capital flowing back to those entrepreneurs. Eventually you will get those killer apps that come on chain and bring a wave of a billion plus users, very similar to what Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube did for Web2 in the mid-2000s.'

Cryptocurrency adoption is currently at the same developmental phase as the internet was in 1999. The total market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency industry is around US$1 trillion, a third of the market capitalisation of Apple alone.'We are relatively still quite early in the journey. Just sit back and relax. I know it has been a turbulent ride. Fasten your seat belts because we will ultimately arrive at our intended destination,' concluded Kalooti.

Future Blockchain Summit continues to cement its position as a leading platform for showcasing cutting-edge blockchain solutions.

BINANCE'S U.S. PLATFORM LOSES LAST LOBBYISTS: Binance.US
, the U.S. affiliate of the global crypto exchange, has parted ways with its last contracted lobbyists as the exchange tries to fend off an onslaught from U.S. regulators and 
grapples with operational issues
.
— Financial services lobbying firm 
FS Vector
 stopped working for Binance.US at the end of September, according to a newly disclosed filing. Binance.US had hired the firm only a year ago as part of 
a burst of hiring that came just before the dramatic collapse
 of rival exchange 
FTX
. 
Fierce Government Relations
, the other firm added during the mini hiring spree, also stopped lobbying for Binance.US at the end of September, according to a termination filed last month.
— Binance.US hired its first outside lobbyists in 2021, bringing on 
Hogan Lovells
 and 
Ice Miller Strategies
 just as the crypto industry was scrambling to make changes to a new crypto tax reporting provision included in the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Binance.US split with those firms at the end of last year. In all, Binance.US dropped more than $1.5 million on lobbying from 2021 to 2023.
— The terminations leave the exchange with a void of registered lobbyists in Washington at a pivotal moment, with Binance.US and the global exchange 
Binance
 facing charges from both the SEC and CFTC and potentially the Justice Department as well. The regulatory pressure has taken a toll on both Binance and Binance.US, with the latter 
undergoing multiple rounds of layoffs and an exodus of executives
 including its CEO.
— The exchange, which is still a member of the crypto trade group 
Digital Chamber of Commerce
, also lacks its own lobbyists with House Republicans on the precipice of passing 
landmark legislation that would create the first regulatory framework
 for digital assets, a move the crypto lobby has pleaded for for years.
— Even Binance, which maintains it operates independently of Binance.US despite sharing leadership — an assertion U.S. regulators cast doubt on — is down to just one remaining outside lobbying firm in D.C. 
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
, which is representing Binance in its case before the CFTC, is the last lobbying firm standing after Binance split up with Ice Miller and Hogan Lovells earlier this year.

ENGSTROM JOINS AMFREE CHAMBER: 
Republican strategist
 Rob Engstrom
 is joining the 
American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce
 as its president, the organization announced today.
— Engstrom is a fixture of the downtown community, having served as the chief political adviser to Washington's top trade associations, including the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce
 and the 
American Bankers Association
 in addition to working for the 
RNC
 and former House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich
. He most recently ran his own firm, 
Wolfe Street Partners
, and was a senior adviser at 
Bullpen Strategy Group
.
— The AmFree Chamber 
launched last year
 in part to serve as a foil to the U.S. Chamber amid deepening fissures between the Republican Party and Big Business, tapping prominent Republicans like former Attorney General 
Bill Barr 
to helm a new legal arm, former ambassador to China and Iowa Gov. 
Terry Branstad
 to serve as chair and former RNC political director 
Gentry Collins 
to serve as CEO.
— The group, which is based in Iowa, said it was aimed at giving smaller businesses more say in advocating for free market policies and limited government and a skepticism of doing business with China, an implicit dig at the U.S. Chamber, whose membership includes some of the world's largest companies in addition to smaller businesses and has defended the globalizing economy.
— The AmFree Chamber has also courted key GOP allies on the Hill like former House Speaker 
Kevin McCarthy
 and House Majority Leader 
Steve Scalise
, both of whom have openly criticized the U.S. Chamber.
— Notably, the AmFree Chamber's rollout of Engstrom's hire, which included praise from more than a dozen Republican members of Congress, New Jersey Democratic Rep. 
Josh Gottheimer
 and trade association leaders, also featured kind words from Engstrom's former colleague, 
Suzanne Clark
, who now leads the U.S. Chamber.
— 'Rob is an old friend of the Chamber's and we look forward to working with him in this new role,' Clark said in a statement provided by the group.
FOSSIL FUEL MAGNATES COME HOME TO TRUMP: 
'Earlier this summer, oil billionaire 
Harold Hamm
 called for 
Donald Trump
 to drop out of the presidential race. He made contributions to the presidential campaigns of Florida Gov. 
Ron DeSantis
 and former U.N. ambassador 
Nikki Haley
 and questioned publicly whether Trump could beat President Biden in the 2024 election,' 
The Washington Post
's 
Josh Dawsey
 and 
Maxine Joselow
 write.
— 'Then late last month, 
Hamm showed up at the 
Mar-a-Lago Club
 in Palm Beach, Fla., brought a $200,000 check for a pro-Trump super PAC, and attended a private meeting with Trump and an intimate fundraiser with the former president, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe donations and private meetings.'
— 'The reversal came as Trump and his team aggressively court donations from the oil and gas industry, one of the main beneficiaries of his time in the White House. Over the course of four years, the Trump administration weakened or wiped out 
more than 125 environmental rules and policies
, many of them designed to limit planet-warming emissions from fossil fuels.'
— 'Biden, by contrast, has reversed many of Trump's policies and enacted dozens of measures aimed at 
moving the nation away from oil, gas and coal
. … In recent weeks, Trump and his team have targeted donors from the oil and gas industry by holding two large events in Texas and calling some of the country's richest executives. The campaign's pitch has been straightforward: Trump is going to be the GOP nominee, so these donors should get on board now.'
 
ANNALS OF SCAM PACS:
 'Since the beginning of the Small Business Administration's loan program during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been stories about fraud, abuse, and notable individuals taking advantage of the program. Now, it turns out, a super PAC 
might have helped itself to the government funds
 as well,' 
The Daily Beast
's 
Roger Sollenberger
 reports.
— 'On Wednesday, the Federal Election Commission sent two notices to a Republican super PAC called ‘
America Great PAC
' inquiring about the circumstances surrounding repayments it made for a $16,500 SBA loan it received in June 2020 as part of the COVID relief program.'
— 'One major problem, among others that The Daily Beast uncovered about the group, is that PACs aren't allowed to take SBA loans. In 2021, the Justice Department sentenced a Nevada man to 46 months in prison for ‘fundraising for fake political action committees (PACs) that he created, and the other involving COVID-19 relief funds he sought and received through fraudulent applications.' This latest instance seems to be just as problematic.'
— 'The super PAC — with a name heavily suggestive of Trump's trademark campaign slogan — appears to be a vehicle for a wide-ranging scam PAC network. The group's website has a donation form with sample text listing an address and phone number tied directly to several identical scam PAC websites, all with different names, but operating under America Great super PAC.'
— 'Many of the sites use the names and images of Republican presidential candidates to raise money on their behalf … with multiple sites for each candidate. The network also runs a political merch operation called ‘US Party Supply,' and the PAC's operator—D.C. area resident 
Jason Pallante
—is also tied to groups with names like ‘Republican National Committee Donor Support' and ‘Republican National Hispanic Assembly.''
 






— 
Sarah Cottrell Propst
 is departing her role as New Mexico's secretary of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources and will join 
American Clean Power
 as vice president of state affairs.
— 
Sabrina Fang
 is also joining ACP in the newly created role of vice president of campaign communications. An alum of the 
American Petroleum Institute

As part of the settlement, Binance's founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), is set to step down from his position as CEO and pay fines totaling USD4.3 billion. The settlement is a response to allegations of anti-money laundering violations, and CZ is expected to plead guilty to these charges, according to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal and the Associated Press.



The resolution also includes Binance agreeing to pay the substantial fines to settle civil claims brought by American regulators, bringing an end to a years-long investigation into the operations of the cryptocurrency giant. The settlement signifies a notable move by the US Department of Justice, which had initially sought between USD4 to USD5 billion from Binance.



The legal scrutiny intensified when Binance faced accusations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange and violating multiple US securities laws. This legal action was initiated through a lawsuit filed by regulators, raising concerns about the exchange's compliance with regulatory standards.



Binance, a limited liability company based in the Cayman Islands, shares similarities with the legal challenges faced by FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, which collapsed the previous year. The charges against CZ extended beyond anti-money laundering violations, including allegations of diverting client funds and concealing the commingling of investors' assets with billions of dollars sent to a third party owned by CZ himself.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_CryptoCurrencies_2.jpg,False,@menafn,10.984541,34f1953aa4baa1df4eab4ed3a3b7c3b8

The crypto industry took a bit of a black eye yesterday 
as Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, 
pleaded guilty
 to a slew of money laundering charges and the company agreed to pay the federal government $4.4 billion in penalties.
The deal forces crypto to reckon with its biggest questions: How 'law-abiding' can an industry really be when it's inherently designed to evade surveillance and reporting? What should the industry's relationship with the government be, and who should be responsible for supervising it? Are crypto markets really something 
new 
at all, or just speculative finance by another name?
Binance's downfall did not come as a surprise to most crypto-watchers. Federal agencies have been monitoring the company's activities for years, as it was widely known for keeping to the crypto world's original Wild West ethos in an effort to drive growth.
'It's not like everybody thought everything was all good at Binance,' Steven Lubka, a managing director at the Bitcoin firm Swan, told me. 'It's been an open secret that things are not okay.'
Binance reached its agreement with the Department of Justice, Treasury, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over a heap of financial crimes including allegations that the company continually processed transactions for individuals and nations sanctioned by the U.S. government, including Hamas and ISIS. Zhao, the company's founder and arguably the most influential person in crypto, stepped down as CEO and agreed to pay a $50 million fine and another $150 million penalty to the CFTC. He faces up to 18 months in prison, and the company will continue to operate under a Treasury-approved monitor.
The structural decapitation and continual federal surveillance
 of the biggest crypto company in the world is not, obviously, immediately a good thing for the industry. But some think that it could clarify the differences between the field's fraudsters and good-faith actors, clearing the lane for lucrative and lawful crypto businesses.
'Some people thought the U.S. government was just going to completely ban and annihilate all of this… I think it's ridiculous to assume that's the outcome,' Lubka said. 'Who has really done the most damage — the industry or the regulators?'
Lubka was citing the high-profile collapses of FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius, all of which spectacularly flamed out amid their own financial mismanagement or outright fraud. The sense that the 'adults' are missing when big decisions are made has been a major focus in the crypto industry recently: POLITICO's Morning Money 
reported today
 on the herd of credibility-boosting law enforcement and security officials who have joined crypto's ranks in recent months, from former defense secretary Mark Esper joining Coinbase's 'global advisory council' to a 
letter to Congress signed by 40 defense officials
 on behalf of the Blockchain Association trade group.
'The signatories state clearly that no amount of money, whether it be gold, dollars, or digital assets should be used to fund illicit activity, but we must also be able have a reasonable conversation about the latter when it comes to proposed solutions to the problem,' Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said in a statement.
Crypto has also been trying to dispel its outlaw image through the use of super PACs, as POLITICO's Jasper Goodman 
reported this week
. A group called Fairshake, partially backed by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, is supporting crypto-friendly members of Congress as a 
bipartisan bill seen as a victory by industry
 makes its way toward the House floor. Coinbase spokesperson Julia Krieger framed crypto regulation in a statement to POLITICO as drawing a line between the 'sides candidates are on — for change or for the status quo.'
In that light, some within the crypto community
 see the Binance deal not as a scarlet letter for the industry, but an overdue comeuppance for an acknowledged bad actor that clears the way for necessary change.
'This has moved us from position one, which is that we have this large, potentially nefarious actor doing God knows what, to that this actor has now been reined in, which is actually an improvement,' Lubka said. 'Binance no longer being the primary exchange where prices are being settled actually removes a number of objections that have hung over this whole dialogue.'
With crypto foes in Washington like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) 
proclaiming the bust
 'part of a larger trend of criminal activity in the crypto industry and sadly predictable,' Lubka's optimism might still face an uphill battle among lawmakers. But with the titanic Binance brought to heel, the industry has more room to cultivate a reputation removed from the terrorist-aiding anarchists and scammers that crypto skeptics fear.
 






































Just 
in case you missed it… 
Sam Altman is back at OpenAI.
After the 
Twitter-borne tumult
 of the several days following his Friday ouster, the charismatic CEO 
is back
 leading the company he co-founded, a resolution supported by Microsoft that also revamps the board to include early Facebook executive Bret Taylor and former Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
POLITICO's Brendan Bordelon reported on the 
fallout this morning in Washington
, where the upheaval is already raising concerns about personal influence and instability at the companies building powerful AI systems.
'I think there's going to be more scrutiny on [effective altruist] stuff in general, probably from both sides of the aisle,' Zach Graves, executive director at the Foundation for American Innovation, told Brendan, referring to the 
philosophical debates
 about AI development that reportedly led to Altman's initial ouster. 'They broke through into the mainstream discourse.'






Spare a thought for 'Galactica,' 
Meta's 'research demo' large language model that crashed and burned last year but left a few useful lessons for developers.
Speaking 
with VentureBeat
 recently, Joelle Pineau, VP of AI research at Meta, said there were 'a lot of good lessons' from the bot's dramatic release and failure — which also, unpropitiously, happened to take place just two weeks before the debut of ChatGPT. Pineau described how users were shocked and appalled by bugs that would come to be expected from more finely tuned models like OpenAI's, such as their tendency to 'hallucinate.'
'It was absolutely a research project… We released with the intent, we did a low-key release, put it on GitHub, the researcher tweeted about it,' she told them. 'Suddenly people had a product expectation, like you would use it to actually write your papers — no, that's not the intent.'
The fiasco of the Galactica release led Meta to be much more careful around that of its Llama LLM in February, with Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun saying a form was required to access it, 'because last time we made an LLM available to everyone (Galactica, designed to help scientists write scientific papers), people threw vitriol at our face and told us this was going to destroy the fabric of society.'

The company is also confronted with fines exceeding USD 4 billion.



Over the past 24 hours, outflows from Binance, excluding bitcoin, have surpassed USD 1 billion, as revealed by market data. The liquidity of the exchange has declined by 25 percent during the same period, with market participants retracting their positions, according to data from Kaiko.



Binance's native token, BNB, witnessed a decrease of over 9 percent, according to CoinGecko data. Blockchain analysis firm Nansen estimates that the crypto exchange holds approximately USD 2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens.



While there have been substantial outflows, the platform still retains assets exceeding USD 65 billion, signifying that there has not been a ""mass exodus"" of funds from the exchange at this time. According to experts, Binance is ""capitalized enough to withstand"" a rapid departure of investors.

According to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal, the settlement, expected to be officially announced soon, entails a series of admissions and concessions.



As part of this landmark agreement, Zhao will step down from his position, acknowledging violations related to anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. The settlement, which involves multiple regulatory bodies, including the Treasury Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, addresses a broad spectrum of allegations against Binance, ranging from money laundering to bank fraud and sanctions violations.



This resolution comes at a crucial juncture for Binance, enabling the exchange to continue its operations despite the extensive regulatory scrutiny it has faced throughout the year. The cryptocurrency industry, in general, has increasingly become the focus of attention from the Justice Department, governmental entities, and lawmakers, heightening the significance of this settlement.



The announcement had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency markets, with Binance Coin (BNB), the native digital asset of the Binance ecosystem, experiencing a notable decline of over 8 percent in response to the news of the impending settlement. Notably, earlier in the day, BNB had reached a five-month peak amid speculations that the Department of Justice (DOJ) would officially confirm a deal with the exchange.



The ongoing scrutiny from United States authorities has culminated in a criminal investigation into Binance and its CEO, making this settlement a critical turning point for the exchange.



Reports suggest that the terms of the settlement require Changpeng Zhao to pay fines totaling USD4.3 billion, covering civil allegations raised by regulatory authorities. The financial repercussions underscore the gravity of the charges and the commitment of regulatory bodies to enforce compliance within the cryptocurrency industry.



As the official announcement of the settlement looms, the broader implications for Binance, its users, and the cryptocurrency market remain subjects of intense speculation.

Washington: The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange has agreed to pay more than $4 billion as part of an agreement with the U.S. government, a person familiar with the agreement told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

The development in the case against Binance was confirmed on the condition of anonymity ahead of an expected announcement. The value was first reported by Bloomberg.

It comes months after the company was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange and violating a slew of U.S. securities laws in a lawsuit from regulators.

Binance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company founded by CEO Changpeng Zhao. The charges were similar to practices uncovered after the collapse of the second largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, last year.

Zhao has also faced allegations of diverting customer funds, concealing the fact that the company was commingling billions of dollars in investor assets and sending them to a third party that Zhao also owned.

At the time the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against the company, Binance said that it had been cooperating with the investigation but said that the agency ""chose to act unilaterally and litigate.'

Changpeng Zhao, founder of world's largest crypto exchange, agreed to plead guilty to federal money laundering charges and step down as chief executive of Binance, which will pay a fine totaling billions of dollars, according to court documents.
 
As part of the plea agreement, Zhao is barred from working with the exchange for three years, according to a court filing dated Nov. 20. He is expected to appear in federal Seattle court on Tuesday and will be fined $50 million.
 
The deal ends the Department of Justice's three-year investigation of Binance and comes months after the firm was accused by regulators of operating as an unregistered securities exchange.
 
Zhao's departure marks the end of an era for one of the crypto industry's longest standing titans, who for years sparred with regulators en route to Binance becoming the largest crypto exchange in the world.
 
Zhao was also an original investor in FTX, the beleaguered crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and money laundering in a trial earlier this month.
 
Court papers filed by the government say that Binance chose not to implement anti-money laundering measures, essentially allowing the firm to become a clearinghouse for all manner of illicit financial transactions. Between 2018 and 2022, that led to nearly $900 million in financial transactions that violated sanctions against Iran, the court papers charge.

This comes as federal prosecutors unveil sweeping allegations against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.



The United States Department of Justice disclosed that Binance admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering practices, unlawful money transmitting, and violations of sanctions. As part of the settlement, the cryptocurrency giant has agreed to pay over USD4 billion to address the Department's investigation into breaches of the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as well as its failure to register as a money transmitting business.



Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen and the face of Binance, faces accusations of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. The Department of Justice contends that Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in pursuit of profit, allowing funds to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.



United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen underscored the severity of Binance's actions, stating that the company's willful failures compromised its integrity by permitting illicit activities on its platform. She emphasized the historic nature of the penalties imposed and the establishment of a monitorship to ensure compliance with United States laws and regulations.



Binance's guilty plea is part of a coordinated effort with the Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. United States Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized the significance of this case, highlighting that Binance's ascent to become the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange was fueled, in part, by criminal activities. The substantial settlement, one of the largest in United States corporate history, sends a clear message that leveraging new technology to break the law will be met with severe consequences, Garland stated.

Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty Tuesday to US money laundering violations, in a deal that will see the cryptocurrency exchange he founded pay over $4 billion in penalties.

""Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed –- now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.

Binance's guilty plea is part of coordinated action including with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Department of Justice said.

Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, the Department of Justice said, and he has resigned from his position of CEO.

Zhao, who is Canadian and lives abroad, entered his plea in person in the United States, added Garland.

Court documents showed Zhao agreed to pay a $50 million fine as part of the plea.

Binance's agreements with the Treasury Department's agencies include a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion and a $968 million penalty involving OFAC. These mark the agencies' largest settlements in history.

""Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.

""Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers through its platform.""

She noted Binance ""deliberately undermined its own sanctions monitoring controls,"" allowing over 1.5 million virtual currency trades violating US sanctions, and failed to report suspicious transactions.

Yellen said the penalties, and a five-year monitorship imposed on Binance, mark a ""milestone for the virtual currency industry.""

- Suspicious activity -

Binance's violations included its failure to prevent and report transactions with groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and matching trades between US users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran and North Korea, said the Treasury.

Moving forward, Binance must file suspicious activity reports required by law, on top of reviewing past transactions to report such activity to authorities, Garland said.

""This will advance our criminal investigations into malicious cyber activity and terrorism fundraising, including the use of cryptocurrency exchanges to support groups such as Hamas,"" he added.

Binance was created in 2017 and cornered much of the crypto-trading market, turning Zhao into a billionaire.

Binance runs crypto exchanges and provides other services across the world, but it has taken a severe hit since crypto markets collapsed and regulators began probing the legality of its business.

Zhao -- often seen as the archrival of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried -- is expected to face sentencing at a later time.

With the deal, Zhao is barred from involvement operating Binance's business for now.

- 'Misguided decisions' -

In a statement, Binance conceded that it ""made misguided decisions along the way"" as it grew rapidly in an industry that was in the ""early stages of regulation.""

""Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter,"" it said.

The company added that it did not initially have adequate compliance controls, saying that it has been working to restructure. Its former global head of regional markets, Richard Teng, will succeed Zhao as CEO.

In a separate social media announcement, Zhao said: ""I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility.""

The latest deal does not include the company's entanglements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, another regulator, which pressed a raft of charges against Binance in June, saying it allowed US residents to trade even when it was not registered in the country as a securities exchange.

The SEC also alleges the firm misused customer funds.

While Binance was founded in China, Zhao moved its operations to other locations internationally after a crackdown on the crypto sector by Beijing.

The volatile industry surged in 2021 with a range of complex products and celebrity endorsements propelling it to a valuation in excess of $3 trillion last year.

But a series of scandals, including the collapse of the FTX exchange and criminal charges for its executives, saw public confidence evaporate and investors pull their money out.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/21/AFP_2cf3cimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,8.3326,bb81e2de39db1eadd6bd7c126a13f588

The bullish prediction from Nigel Green of deVere Group comes as Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, the founder of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, pleaded guilty to money laundering violations on Tuesday and agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down from his role as the company's chief executive.

The company itself also pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines and restitution to the government, according to federal authorities.

Nigel Green says: ""CZ until now has been the most influential and powerful person in crypto. As such, this scandal is going to trigger some short-term volatility in the market as investors digest the news.

""However, the crypto market will thrive as institutional money is pouring in and we expect it to continue to do so.""

""BlackRock, the $9trillion asset manager, alongside WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets, have published Bitcoin ETF applications waiting to be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC.

""We believe that Bitcoin ETFS are an imminent inevitability, and this would help drive crypto prices and mass adoption.

""Should SEC approval happen, it would be a landmark moment for Bitcoin. The approval by the financial regulator of the world's largest economy of this spot ETF would show that Bitcoin is, without any question, part of the global mainstream financial system.""

Spot ETFs invest directly in underlying assets, typically stocks or bonds, at the current market price (spot price). They aim to replicate the performance of a specific index or asset class by holding a portfolio of the actual securities that make up the index.

The Binance fiasco is another blow to the crypto market following the FTX scandal last year. After a month-long trial, a jury recently convicted the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.

""It appears that law enforcement and regulatory authorities worldwide are cracking down on executives and companies as digital currencies in all their forms - crypto and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) - are set to become increasingly dominant in the international financial system,"" says the deVere CEO.

""Greater regulatory scrutiny must be championed as digital currencies are set to play an ever-greater role. Cryptocurrencies must come into the regulatory tent and be held to the same standards as the rest of the financial system.

""They are here to stay - and the market is only set to grow. There can be no doubt that regulation of the crypto ecosystem is required and, I believe, it should be a priority.""

He concludes: ""The CZ news is a jaw-dropping blow in many ways, but this moment must now be used as a point of inflection to further shore-up the sector and instil trust and transparency by means of sensible, workable regulation as crypto continues its ascent.""

Binance Holdings Ltd. had such lax controls over cryptocurrency transactions on its exchange that terrorists, hackers and sanctions violators used it for years to move billions of dollars, US prosecutors said.
 
Binance and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges Tuesday, admitting they failed to take basic anti-money laundering steps that are the bedrock of government efforts to check the flow of dirty money worldwide. Binance will pay $4.3 billion, while Zhao will step down as CEO and pay a $50 million fine. 
 
The stunning turn of events means Zhao, the most powerful crypto figure in the world, faces prison time and will no longer run the industry's largest exchange. It comes after a multiyear investigation by federal prosecutors and the fraud conviction earlier this month of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the collapsed FTX exchange.
 
Employees at Binance were engaged in a wide array of misconduct, and many were aware of the consequences of allowing millions of illegal transactions, according to the Justice Department and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. 
 
'Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.' 
 
Because of those failures, the US said, Binance allowed the following to take place:
 
• The al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, used Bitcoin transactions to raise money for the Palestinian resistance. Hamas, which has been designated by the US as a terrorist organization, murdered more than 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7. Binance failed to file suspicious activity reports with the US about Hamas fundraising, according to FinCEN.
 
• Binance allowed Bitcoin transactions with other terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida and ISIS, FinCEN said.
 
• At least 1.1 million transactions valued at $899 million were conducted by people living in Iran, in violation of US sanctions, the company admitted.
 
• Exchange users in Cuba and Syria, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, engaged in millions of dollars in transactions in violation of US sanctions, Binance admitted.
 
• Binance users made $275 million in deposits from BestMixer, a crypto platform that helped obscure the digital money trail, the company said. Dutch authorities shut it down in 2019, saying it was 'probably used to conceal and launder the criminal flows of money.'
 
• Customers transferred $106 million in Bitcoin from Hydra Market, the Russian darknet marketplace, to Binance wallets between 2017 and 2022, the company admitted. US and German authorities seized Hydra's servers in 2022, calling it the world's largest and most prominent darknet market. It sold hacking software, fake IDs and illegal drugs such as heroin, cocaine and LSD.
 
• Binance addresses handled tens of millions of dollars in transactions involving 24 strains of ransomware, with names like SamSam, Satan and WannaCry. While the company worked with law enforcement when notified, it deprived authorities of critical information about those attacks, FinCEN said. In 2021, the US indicted three North Korean military hackers over WannaCry attacks.
 
• More than 1,000 transactions took place involving three marketplaces that dealt in child pornography and related material, FinCEN said. An administrator of one of those sites, Dark Scandals, was indicted in 2020. The site featured violent rape videos.

Binance Holdings Limited (Binance), the entity that operates the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pleaded guilty and has agreed to pay over $4 billion to resolve the US Justice Department's investigation into violations.

'Zhao, a Canadian national, also pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) programme, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and has resigned as CEO of Binance,' the Justice Department said in a statement late on Tuesday.

Richard Teng, Binance's former global head of regional markets, will be the exchange's new CEO, Zhao said in a post on X.'Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has,' Zhao added.

'As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions,' he said.

According to court documents, Binance admitted to prioritising growth and profits over compliance with US law.

Binance was launched in 2017 and focused on attracting high-volume customers. Binance failed to implement controls and procedures to prevent money laundering and also did not implement controls that would have prevented US customers from conducting transactions with customers in sanctioned jurisdictions.

'Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,' said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.

'The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,' Garland added.

Zhao said in his post on X that he will now do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech.

'I can't see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being a one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur,' he posted.

127,"Founder of Binance, world's largest crypto exchange, pleads guilty to anti-money-laundering charge",Associated Press,2023-11-21 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/11/21/us-reaches-over-4-billion-settlement-with-worlds-largest-cryptocurrency-exchange-ap-source-says,ny1.com,"The U.S. government has dealt a massive blow to Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government dealt a massive blow to the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance as its founder, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to a felony charge Tuesday related to his failure to prevent money laundering on his platform.
 
Binance also agreed to a roughly $4 billion settlement with the U.S. over violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and apparent violations of sanctions programs, including failure to put into place a suspicious transaction reporting programs. Zhao announced that he stepped down as the company's chief executive. 
 
Over the summer, the company was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange and violating a slew of U.S. securities laws 
in a lawsuit from regulators.
 That case was similar to practices uncovered after the collapse of FTX, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange, last year.
 
'Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed — now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,' said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. 'The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal.'
 
Zhao pleaded guilty to one count of failure to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program in federal court in Seattle. Binance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company. 
 
Binance said in a statement that it made 'misguided decisions' as it quickly grew to become the world's largest crypto exchange and that the settlement acknowledges its 'responsibility for historical, criminal compliance violations.""
 
'Ever since Binance launched its convertible virtual currency platform, it has knowingly evaded the U.S. laws designed to protect these systems,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. 'Binance was allowing illicit actors to transact freely, supporting activities from child sexual abuse, to illegal narcotics, to terrorism, across more than 100,000 transactions.' 
 
The U.S. Treasury said Binance allowed Hamas' military wing al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Qaeda and other criminals to conduct transactions.
 
'Binance processed these transactions, but it never filed a single suspicious activity report,' Yellen said. 'And it also allowed over 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated U.S. sanctions.' 
 
As part of a settlement agreement, Binance will be subject to five years of monitoring and 'significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance's complete exit from the United States,' according to the U.S. Treasury.
 
Magistrate Judge Brian A. Tsuchida set Zhao's sentencing for Feb. 23, however that's likely to be delayed. He faces a possible guideline sentence range of up to 18 months. 
 
The judge questioned Zhao to make sure he understood the plea agreement, saying at one point: 'You knew you didn't have controls in place.'
 
'Yes, your honor,' he replied.
 
One of his attorneys, Mark Bartlett, noted that Zhao had been aware of the investigation since December 2020, and surrendered willingly even though the United Arab Emirates — where Zhao lives — has no extradition treaty with the U.S.
 
'He decided to come here and face the consequences,' Bartlett said. 'He's sitting here. He pled guilty.'
 
Zhao, who is married and has young children in the UAE, promised that he would return to the U.S. for sentencing if allowed to stay there in the meantime. 
 
'I want to take responsibility and close this chapter in my life,' Zhao said. 'I want to come back. Otherwise I wouldn't be here today.'
 
Zhao had previously faced allegations of diverting customer funds, concealing the fact that the company was commingling billions of dollars in investor assets and sending them to a third party that Zhao also owned. 
 
The cryptocurrency industry has been marred by scandals and market meltdowns. Sam Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old founder of FTX, was convicted 
earlier this month
 of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors. 
 
Of his many depictions in the cryptocurrency industry, Zhao was best known as the chief rival to Bankman-Fried.
 
Zhao and Bankman-Fried were originally friendly competitors in the industry, with Binance investing in FTX when Bankman-Fried launched the exchange in 2019. However, the relationship between the two deteriorated, culminating in Zhao announcing he was selling all of his cryptocurrency investments in FTX in early November 2022. FTX filed for bankruptcy a week later.
 
At this trial and in later public statements, Bankman-Fried tried cast blame on Binance and Zhao for allegedly orchestrating a run on the bank at FTX.
 
A jury found Bankman-Fried guilty of wire fraud and several other charge in October. He is expected to be sentenced in March, where he could face decades in prison.

128,"Binance's Changpeng Zhao resigns as CEO, pleads guilty after violating US anti-money laundering laws",Reuters,2023-11-22 00:00:00,date,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/binances-changpeng-zhao-resigns-as-ceo-pleads-guilty-after-violating-us-anti-money-laundering-laws-2465967-2023-11-22,indiatoday.in,Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws and agreed to a USD 4.3 billion settlement.,"Binance chief Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty to breaking U.S. anti-money laundering laws as part of a $4.3 billion settlement resolving a years-long probe into the world's largest crypto exchange, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
The deal, which will see Zhao personally pay $50 million, was described by prosecutors as one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history. It is another blow to the crypto industry that has been beset by investigations and comes on the heels of the recent fraud conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
But several legal experts said it was a good outcome for Zhao, leaving his vast wealth intact and allowing him to retain his stake in Binance, the exchange he founded in 2017.
Binance broke U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with organizations the U.S. described as terrorist groups including Hamas, al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, authorities said.
The exchange also never reported transactions with websites devoted to selling child sexual abuse materials and was one of the largest recipients of ransomware proceeds, they said.
""Binance made it easy for criminals to move their stolen funds and illicit proceeds on its exchanges,"" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Tuesday. ""Binance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law. It pretended to comply.""
Some of the charges, which are both criminal and civil, relate to practices that Reuters reported first in a series of articles in 2022.
The Justice Department, which negotiated the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Treasury Department, is seeking an 18-month prison sentence for Zhao, the maximum suggested under federal guidelines, the New York Times reported.
Binance's former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim was charged by the CFTC, the agency said. Neither Lim nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.
Binance will pay $1.81 billion within 15 months, and a further $2.51 billion forfeiture as part of the deal, prosecutors said.
Zhao, a billionaire, was born in China and moved to Canada at the age of 12. He pleaded guilty in a Seattle court on Tuesday afternoon.
""Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance,"" Zhao said on social media after the settlement was announced. ""Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.""
While authorities have probed Zhao and Binance for years, Zhao's exit marks a dramatic development for one of the most powerful figures in the crypto industry, and for Binance. The deal raises questions over the future of the crypto exchange, which he has tightly controlled.
Richard Teng, a longtime Binance executive, will take over at Binance, Zhao said in his post.
""These resolutions acknowledge our company's responsibility for historical, criminal compliance violations, and allow our company to turn the page,"" Binance said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Teng said that his focus would be on ""reassuring users that they can remain confident in the financial strength, security and safety of the company.""
Zhao retains Binance stake
Vanderbilt University law professor Yesha Yadav said while the fine was extremely large it appeared manageable for Binance.
""This deal...looks designed to give Binance the chance to live another day, while removing CZ, a figurehead who has been so intrinsically linked to the growth of a business model,"" she said.
Since Zhao appears to be retaining his stake in Binance, however, it's possible he may still be able to exert influence on the company, Yadav added.
Zhao is worth $10.2 billion, according to Forbes.
Given the seriousness of the violations and actors involved, Zhao appears to have ""come out of this looking pretty good"" as the U.S. government likely had to entice him to come to the U.S., said Robert Frenchman of Mukasey Frenchman LLP.
""He still has enormous wealth,"" Frenchman said. ""He isn't likely to spend too much time in a U.S. jail. He retains his ownership stake in Binance, a company that has now resolved some of its biggest legal issues.""
Prosecutors likely weighed those benefits for Zhao against the possibility that he may not have otherwise surrendered and the desire to convince Binance to agree to pay a hefty sum, said Jeffrey Cohen, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor.
""If you can get a good number for a corporate fine and the cost is that the individual defendants take a slightly lesser penalty, the government makes that calculation,"" Cohen said.
""Potentially illegal""
Binance has been under the Justice Department's scrutiny since at least 2018, Reuters reported last year, just one of a string of legal headaches it faces in the United States.
Federal prosecutors asked the company in December 2020 to provide internal records about its anti-money laundering efforts, along with communications involving Zhao.
The CFTC filed its civil charges against Binance in March, alleging it failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program to detect and prevent terrorist financing.
Internally, Binance officers and employees acknowledged that the platform facilitated ""potentially illegal activities,"" the CFTC alleged.
In February 2019, Binance's Lim received information on transactions by the militant Palestinian group Hamas on Binance, the CFTC wrote.
Lim, a Singaporean, ""explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send ‘small sums' as ‘large sums constitute money laundering',"" the CFTC said in its March lawsuit.
Daniel Silva, a partner at law firm Buchalter and former federal prosecutor said the allegations likely could have supported charges against Zhao carrying stiffer penalties like fraud or money laundering.
""He was at risk of much more serious charges, and so this resolution is a very favorable one for him,"" Silva said.
Even so, a guilty plea involving the CEO of a company is rare and underscores the Justice Department's push under Democratic leadership for charges against executives.
""The government is beating a drum on the issue of individual accountability,"" said Kit Addleman, a partner with Haynes Boone law firm in Dallas.
She noted the size of the fines make clear the U.S. government wants to rein in the crypto sector, describing the financial size of the deal as ""staggering"".",indiatoday.in,1817,news,IN,en,Reuters,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202311/binance-222139484-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=AZ3sMvle5oDW8PrnctOtX9WGS6sLNMRm,False,@indiatoday,7.0274544,6868dea008140d1cf313e7f8b515dc4f

While this pans out, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) remain mostly correlated with Bitcoin. 


XRP, BNB Decoupling From Bitcoin


While rising de-correlation suggests that the market is maturing and becoming more sophisticated, secondary factors could make some of the top altcoins decouple and chart their courses away from the tight grasp of Bitcoin. 
 
Sharing 
data
 from Kaiko, a blockchain analytics firm, @cryptobusy on X notes that the correlation between Bitcoin, XRP, and BNB has been contracting in the last two months. Meanwhile, BTC, Dogecoin, and Cardano prices have been moving in sync despite fundamental factors of each project impacting price action over this period.

The drop in correlation indicates that altcoins are increasingly gaining more market share from Bitcoin. This drop in Bitcoin dominance happens especially whenever certain altcoins move independently and are not influenced by how Bitcoin trends. 


In most cases, like it has been the case in Q4 2023, a spike in Bitcoin prices triggers altcoin demand, lifting them as a result. Besides Cardano and Dogecoin, for instance, 
Solana (SOL)
 and Tron (TRX) are two altcoins that have been rallying and tracking Bitcoin.


Additionally, the drop in correlation could mean the altcoin scene is maturing, and more investors are keen on picking out projects that offer more utility, not just BTC proxies. With more investors, altcoins tend to be more liquid, drawing even more capital.


BNB, XRP, BTC Impacted By Fundamental Factors


Even so, there could be more that explains the decoupling, especially with BNB and XRP. Seismic fundamental events have impacted BTC, XRP, and BNB ecosystems in the last two months. 
 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for instance, is likely to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs filed by several heavyweights, including BlackRock and Fidelity, in the coming weeks. Hopes of the regulator authorizing these derivatives tracking spot BTC prices have catalyzed demand, lifting the coin to new 2023 highs.

Meanwhile, a United States court ruled in favor of XRP being a utility when sold to retailers. The case initially forced prices higher, but the coin tracked lower throughout late Q3 2023 and 2024, only steadying as BTC rallied. 


At the same time, BNB was negatively impacted by 
Changpeng Zhao
, the founder of Binance, resigning in November 2023. The Department of Justice also fined Binance with a $4.3 billion penalty as a settlement.

Manila: The Philippines will block access to cryptocurrency giant Binance, an official said Thursday, as part of a crackdown on online trading platforms operating in the country without licences.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Tuesday that Binance was not registered in the Philippines and therefore not authorised to sell or offer securities in the country.

Filipinos could withdraw their investments before access to Binance's platform and apps was blocked, which was expected to happen ""within three months"", it said.

Other online trading platforms, including OctaFX and Mitrade, will be blocked in the coming months after the SEC found they were also operating without necessary licences.

""We want to keep the investing public safe,"" SEC Commissioner Kelvin Lester Lee told AFP on Thursday.

""These entities were given a chance, multiple times, over the last few years to register... the fact that a lot of them chose not to do so, that implies something to us.""

The SEC also asked Google and Meta to stop Binance advertisements from appearing in the Philippines.

""We're not the only one doing this, a lot of other countries are doing the same thing,"" Lee said.

""If you're not registered, you'll automatically have a problem.""

TG has a native token, TGC, which offers staking rewards, buybacks, and cashback. More than $3 million worth of presale funding has already been raised. Wall Street Memes (WSM) : After raising more than $19 million in presale funding, Wall Street Memes now trades on various tier-one exchanges.

Our Analysis of New and Upcoming Binance Listings Read on for more information about the projects listed above. We analyze the best new coins on Binance, exploring the upside potential, risks, use cases, and much more. 1. Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF): New Project Offering Token Rewards as Bitcoin ETFs are Approved (Over $1.7 Million Raised) Bitcoin ETF Token is a new cryptocurrency project that is currently raising presale funds. So far, over $1.7 million has been raised. This project has developed an innovative concept; it rewards token holders when Bitcoin ETF approvals are announced. Now could be a great time to invest in BTCETF, considering the buzz surrounding Bitcoin ETFs as we approach 2024. According to some industry experts, the SEC could approve its first Bitcoin ETF early next year. So how does Bitcoin ETF Token work, and how does it enable you to make money from these approvals? Well, the project has created five milestones, and when each one is achieved, it burns 5% of the total supply. In addition to Bitcoin ETF approvals, this also includes Bitcoin surpassing $100,000. Another milestone is triggered when BTCETF hits a market capitalization of $100 million. These easily achievable milestones will continuously reduce the total supply of BTCETF tokens. This makes it a deflationary cryptocurrency, something that will appeal to long-term investors. Bitcoin ETF Token also offers competitive staking rewards; the APY is currently 140%. This enables you to earn passive rewards while you wait for each milestone to be achieved. We also like Bitcoin ETF Token for its presale discount. Investors can buy BTCETF tokens for just $0.0058. This price will continue to increase until stage 10 of the presale. At this point, late-stage investors will pay $0.0068 – which is 17% more than the current price. Not only that but Bitcoin ETF Token will launch on crypto exchanges after its presale. The specific exchanges haven't been announced yet, but Binance will be a top target for the team. In the meantime, this is one of the best new cryptocurrencies to buy .

Invest in the Future of Decentralized Bitcoin Mining Through a Stake-to-Mine Model

Bitcoin Minetrix is another innovative project that could make the list of upcoming Binance listings. After all, Binance often chooses projects that display quality use cases and solutions to existing problems. Bitcoin Minetrix meets this criteria, as it's revolutionizing the way that consumers mine Bitcoin.

It has created the stake-to-mine model, meaning people can mine BTC tokens by staking BTCMTX. This is the native token backing Bitcoin Minetrix and it operates on the Ethereum network. This makes the stake-to-mine concept eco-friendly, as Ethereum has cut energy usage by 99% since migrating to proof-of-stake .

As users stake BTCMTX tokens and passively earn credits, they can exchange them for Bitcoin mining power. As a result, Bitcoin can be mined without expensive equipment, mining expertise, or electricity consumption. The stake-to-mine mechanism can also help BTCMTX tokens increase their value organically.

This is because holders are encouraged to stake their tokens rather than engage in short-term speculation. Bitcoin Minetrix is still in the midst of its presale campaign. The project has sold more than $4.4 million worth of BTCMTX tokens. There is still time to catch the presale before it ends. Right now, presale investors are paying just $0.0118.

Blockchain and AI-Powered Battle Game With Over $2 Million in Presale Funding

Meme Kombat is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy from the GameFi niche. This sentiment is supported by Meme Kombat's ongoing presale, which has already raised over $2 million. The project is building a decentralized gaming ecosystem that is powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).

It's a battle game, where popular meme characters fight to the death. Players can bet on their favorite meme characters, whether that's Pepe or FLOKI. Pre-match and in-play betting odds are generated automatically, based on the strengths and traits of each meme. According to Meme Kombat, its meme battles are randomly generated and secured by smart contracts.

Moreover, Meme Kombat has introduced staking elements into its ecosystem. That is, players need to stake MK tokens before they can place bets. In doing so, they'll currently earn APYs of 423%. Although Meme Kombat is still in presale, more than 2,650 investors have already staked their tokens.

We also like that Meme Kombat has set a low presale hardcap of just $10 million. It's selling 50% of the total MK supply; meaning the project will begin life on exchanges with a $20 million valuation. You can also secure a presale discount, with MK tokens currently available for just $0.214 each. Although ambitious, MK could be one of the next Binance listings for 2023.

TG has built an anonymous casino and sportsbook on the Telegram app. Unlike many crypto-centric gambling sites, TG is regulated and safe. It has secured an e-gambling license from the Governor of Curaçao, which is overseen by the Curaçao Gaming Control Board. This brings legitimacy to TG while still allowing players to avoid KYC processes.

In fact, players only need to join the TG Telegram channel to get started – no account is needed. Players can then choose from hundreds of games, including slots, video poker, dice, blackjack, and roulette. TG offers first-time players a 200% deposit bonus of up to 10 ETH. That said, even greater rewards are available to those holding TGC tokens.

For instance, TGC deposits benefit from a 25% cashback on losses. TGC tokens can be staked too, with APYs currently at 194%. These staking rewards are sustainable, as TG funds it from casino and sportsbook profits. What's more, TG also uses profits to repurchase its own tokens.

It then burns 40% of the purchase amount, which benefits token holders long-term.

132,Cristiano Ronaldo Sued For Promoting Binance And Unregistered Securities,MENAFN,2023-11-29 00:00:00,date,https://menafn.com/1107510656/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Sued-For-Promoting-Binance-And-Unregistered-Securities,menafn.com,Legendary footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has found himself entangled in a legal battle as a lawsuit was filed against him in a Florida District Court.,"(MENAFN- AsiaNet News) Legendary footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has found himself entangled in a legal battle as a lawsuit was filed against him in a Florida District Court. The plaintiffs, Michael Sizemore, Mikey Vongdara, and Gordon Lewis, allege that Ronaldo's promotion of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance led to their financial losses. This comes amid Binance facing scrutiny for inadequate anti-money laundering measures and being instructed to pay $4.3 billion in settlements to US authorities.

According to the filed lawsuit, Ronaldo is accused of actively participating in the promotion, assistance, and sale of unregistered securities in collaboration with Binance. The Al-Nassr star, who initiated a multi-year partnership with the exchange in mid-2022, was slated to endorse his own Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as part of the agreement. The plaintiffs argue that users engaging with Ronaldo's NFT collection were more inclined to use Binance for other purposes, including the purchase of unregistered securities such as the BNB token and the exchange's yield programs.

The legal document asserts that Ronaldo's promotional activities effectively solicited or assisted Binance in soliciting investments in unregistered securities. By leveraging his massive following, which comprises millions of followers, fans, and supporters, the Portuguese legend allegedly encouraged individuals to invest in the Binance platform. The unregistered securities highlighted in the lawsuit specifically encompass the BNB token and Binance's yield programs.

The lawsuit contends that Ronaldo either knew or should have known about Binance's alleged sale of unregistered crypto securities. Emphasizing the former Manchester United star's investment experience and substantial resources, the document suggests that he had the means to seek external advice to understand the nature of Binance's activities. This raises questions about Ronaldo's accountability in promoting a platform accused of dealing in unregistered securities.

Furthermore, the lawsuit references the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) warning to celebrities regarding the disclosure of payments received for promoting cryptocurrencies. The plaintiffs claim that Ronaldo failed to disclose the payments he received from Binance, adding another layer to the legal dispute. This lack of transparency raises concerns about compliance with regulatory guidelines in the cryptocurrency promotion space.

Ronaldo's legal troubles coincide with the broader challenges faced by Binance. Recently, the platform's CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), pleaded guilty to money laundering charges and agreed to step down from his position as the company's head. The combination of legal woes and leadership changes underscores the tumultuous situation surrounding one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/29/AN_16d95image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,9.064446,1a754c1c7b7b282dff8a275dbe9b4459

According to OkayBeary the plaintiffs, Michael Sizemore, Mikey Vongdara, and Gordon Lewis and claimed that they suffered losses because Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the exchange.

The said lawsuit was filed on November 27 in a Florida district court, accusing Ronaldo of active participation in the cryptocurrency exchance firm's business drive.

The lawsuit filing stated,""Plaintiffs file this Complaint on behalf of themselves, and all other similarly situated consumers who purchased unregistered securities offered or sold by Binance, 1 against Defendant, Cristiano Ronaldo, who promoted, assisted in, and/or actively participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in coordination with Binance.

The said lawsuit says that Ronaldo - with his access to investment knowledge and expert advice - should have known that Binance was selling unlicensed securities. Hence, plaintiffs want compensation for their losses.

'Binance's partnership with celebrities like Ronaldo was clearly designed to use the positive reputation associated with specific celebrities to convince consumers that Binance was a safe place to buy and sell cryptocurrency,' it further added.

Ronaldo's collaboration with Binance started in 2022. Since then, thanks to the player's enormous social media presence - over 850 million across platforms - Binance saw a 500% increase in online searches.

Doha, Qatar: Cristiano Ronaldo has become the subject of a proposed class-action lawsuit due to his endorsement of the $4.3 billion compensation-struck crypto exchange Binance, currently under legal scrutiny.

A November 27 legal filing in a Florida District Court accuses Ronaldo of ""participating in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in conjunction with Binance,"" as per reports from Binance Square.

The claim suggests that users enticed by Ronaldo's Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) were more likely to utilize Binance for additional investments, including those in purported unregistered securities like Binance's own BNB and its crypto yield programs.

The lawsuit contends that Ronaldo, with his investment acumen and access to external advisors, should have been aware of Binance's alleged dealings in unregistered crypto securities.

The filing further argues that the football star failed to disclose compensation for promoting cryptocurrencies, as advised by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""Ronaldo's promotional activities effectively solicited investments in unregistered securities by urging his vast social media following to engage with the Binance platform,"" the complaint states.

As a 'paid spokesman' Ronaldo's immense social influence, encompassing over 850 million followers across various platforms, was integral to Binance's growing popularity.

The complaint alleges that his NFT sales significantly boosted the exchange's profile, citing a 500% surge in searches for ""Binance"" following the initial NFT launch.

In mid-2022, after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority had flagged Binance as a 'significant risk' to consumers, Ronaldo entered into a multi-year promotional partnership with the exchange.

This collaboration involved a series of NFTs linked to Ronaldo, featuring at least three collections associated with Binance.

Zhao was released last week on a $175 million bond and has a sentencing hearing on February 23.

Prosecutors urged that Zhao be prevented from leaving the country before his sentencing, but his lawyers argued that he be allowed to travel, saying in a briefing that he ""voluntarily flew"" to the US for his guilty plea, reports CNBC.

'In the vast majority of cases, a multi-billionaire defendant who has pleaded guilty, faces possible prison time, and lives in a country that does not extradite its citizens to the US would be detained,' the government wrote in a filing to the court.

Prosecutors stated that they had already submitted an ""exceptional recommendation"" that Zhao be allowed to remain free until his sentencing.

They stated that Zhao poses a flight risk, but that it ""could be managed by requiring him to remain in the US and preventing him from returning to the safe haven of the UAE"", the report mentioned.

Last week, Zhao stepped down as the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, after pleading guilty to federal charges and agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines.

'Zhao, a Canadian national, also pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) programme, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and has resigned as CEO of Binance,' the Justice Department said in a statement.

According to court documents, Binance admitted to prioritising growth and profits over compliance with US law.

Filed in a Florida court, the lawsuit alleges that Ronaldo actively participated in the sale of unregistered securities, particularly non-fungible tokens (NFTs) portraying significant moments from his career. This alleged involvement has purportedly led to substantial financial losses for investors.

In November 2022, Ronaldo joined forces with Binance for the promotion and sale of unique NFTs, transforming digital art into verifiable assets on the blockchain. The legal complaint asserts that Ronaldo made deceptive statements and lent his name and image to Binance's allegedly misleading promotions, resulting in the sale of unregistered crypto securities vulnerable to market fluctuations.

Furthermore, the plaintiffs argue that Ronaldo failed to disclose the nature or extent of his compensation from Binance, a violation of US law. Emphasising the significance of such disclosures, the lawsuit references Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who stressed the importance of celebrities revealing their financial arrangements when endorsing securities. Notably, last year, the SEC fined Kim Kardashian over $1 million for a comparable matter.

Seeking damages exceeding $1 billion, the class action lawsuit persists despite legal scrutiny. Ronaldo continues to endorse Binance, sharing an advertisement with his 110 million followers on X account as recently as November 28.

This legal challenge against Ronaldo mirrors similar actions targeting celebrities endorsing cryptocurrency platforms, including Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Kim Kardashian, and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. These lawsuits underscore the imperative for public figures to transparently disclose their affiliations with digital financial institutions, emphasising the distinctive implications of endorsing cryptocurrencies compared to traditional products like sports beverages or athletic apparel.

announced
 its largest settlement in history with the virtual currency exchange Binance. This almost-billion dollar settlement is a part of a larger 
 comprehensive settlement
 with the Department of Justice, FinCEN, and the CFTC, totaling over $4 billion. OFAC found that Binance had allowed 1.6 million transactions in violation of multiple sanctions regimes while Binance's C-Suite was complicit. Binance's blunders that led to this enforcement action highlight the importance of management commitment to compliance programs.
1
 
This penalty is news in and of itself, but the news is not niche or limited to cryptocurrencies or the exchanges on which they are traded. In going after the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, 
OFAC is sending a clear message to any company involved in FinTech: you cannot hide behind your algorithms or paper compliance programs.
 FinTech companies cannot claim that, just because theirs is a new area, a new technology, a new way of doing business, that it cannot be subject to, or comply with, the existing rules that govern international transactions involving U.S. persons, U.S. banks, or the U.S. Dollar.
 
Binance is a virtual currency trading platform with millions of users across the planet. The platform used an algorithm to match buying and selling orders from users with other users on its platform. This algorithm would complete trades based only on time and value which led to transactions between U.S.-users and users from sanctioned countries. Not only do OFAC sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from transactions involving sanctioned countries and parties, they also prohibit any person from 
causing
 U.S. persons from participating in transactions involving sanctioned parties.
 
Binance's compliance program did little to stop these transactions. For instance, the Terms of Use for Binance stated that in using the platform users are declaring they are not on any sanctions list. Considering 
 most people never read Terms of Service
, it is easy to see why this was ineffective. Binance also created a U.S.-only platform and implemented IP screening, but, at the same time, Binance encouraged users to use a VPN to work around these geofencing measure.
 
Binance's compliance issues started at the top. Their CEO and CCO painted a rosy picture of compliance when dealing with third parties, but internally, they made deliberate choices to hamstring their own compliance program. Multiple times the CEO and the CCO were made aware of users from sanctioned countries on the platform, but each time their response was not to fix the problem but to hide it, even going as far to say that ""compliance is her to make Binance APPEAR compliant."" OFAC found this complicity to be an aggravating factor. If anything, this should highlight the importance of management buy-in to compliance programs because that is where a culture of compliance can begin.
 
It is important to assess your company's risks and build a compliance around those elements that make your company unique. OFAC has provided 
compliance guidance for the virtual currency industry
, which applies its compliance framework to the unique issues faced in the financial technologies industry. Any virtual currency platform should have internal controls like Know Your Customer Procedures and transaction monitoring. Your compliance program should assess and audit these internal systems and empower operations managers to make changes where needed. It should also train employees on how to protect the company. As the Binance settlement show, all these measures are for naught if there is not management buy-in.
 
Binance's Apparent Violations amounted to less than 0.0028% of their total trade volume, but OFAC hit them with the largest fine in history. This shows that OFAC takes these violations seriously and will view ""paper programs"" as egregious. FinTech companies—start-up or established—as well as traditional financial institutions with an international footprint can learn from this cases because the message is not that OFAC is done with enforcement in this area. It appears the agency is just getting started.

Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has been hit with class-action lawsuit seeking at least $1 billion in damages for his role in promoting cryptocurrency-related'non-fungible tokens,' or NFTs, issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida on Monday alleges that Ronaldo's promotion of Binance was'deceptive and unlawful.' Binance's partnership with high-profile figures like Ronaldo, the plaintiffs claim, led them into costly and unsafe investments.

'Evidence now reveals that Binance's fraud was only able to reach such heights through the offer and sale of unregistered securities, with the willing help and assistance of some of the wealthiest, powerful and recognised organisations and celebrities across the globe - just like Defendant Ronaldo,' the suit reads.

Representatives for Ronaldo declined to comment on Thursday. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, did not immediately return requests for statement from The Associated Press.

Ronaldo launched his inaugural NFT'CR7' collection with Binance in November of last year, ahead of the 2022 World Cup. The NFTs - which had starting prices ranging from the equivalent of about $77 to $10,000 - featured seven animated statues depicting Ronaldo from iconic moments in his life, from bicycle-kick goals to his childhood in Portugal.



Monday's suit says that the promotional efforts of Ronaldo's Binance partnership were'incredibly successful' - alleging a 500% increase in online searches using the keyword'Binance' after the soccer star's NFTs was announced. The collection's premium-level NFTs sold out within the first week, the suit claims.

The suit also alleges that Ronaldo should've disclosed how much Binance has paid him for the partnership. The US Securities and Exchange Commission previously noted that federal law requires celebrities to publicly disclose how much they're getting paid to promote securities, including crypto assets.

NFTs are ordinary digital images with an attached version number that have been added to a cryptocurrency blockchain, a process designed to make them'unique' collectibles. NFTs enjoyed a brief boom, but have since largely collapsed in value as the crypto industry has been marred by scandals and market meltdowns.

Over the summer, Binance was accused of operating as an unregistered securities exchange and violating a slew of US securities laws in a lawsuit from regulators. The crypto exchange agreed last week to pay a roughly $4 billion settlement and its founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down as CEO and pleaded guilty to a felony related to his failure to prevent money laundering on the platform.

This week's lawsuit against Ronaldo isn't the first time that a celebrity has faced litigation over crypto promotions. Last year, for example, a host of Hollywood and sports stars - including Larry David and Tom Brady - were named as defendants in a class-action suit against FTX, which was the second-largest crypto exchange before it collapsed in November 2022. The suit argued that the celebrities' status made them culpable for promoting FTX's failed business model.

Ronaldo is one of the most recognisable and wealthiest athletes in the world. He leads his home country Portugal's national team and has played for the Spanish team Real Madrid, the Italian club Juventus and Manchester United in England. He now plays for the Saudi Arabian professional team Al Nassr.

Ronaldo has continued to promote Binance on his official website and social media platforms. Most recently, on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) Ronaldo reposted a Binance video and wrote that he was'Cooking something up' with the crypto exchange on Tuesday.

Continue Reading

Drawing on a sample of over 1,000 respondents, the survey found that nearly half (45%) listed earning extra income as their primary use for crypto, followed by saving money (19%) and offsetting inflation (9%). More than a third (36%) of respondents indicated that achieving financial security and independence was the primary motivation for using crypto for savings.

Aman from Asia, featured in Binance's content series, discusses how the rising inflation in his country added increasing pressure on his ability to pay his university fees. He talks about how he used crypto to maintain the value of his savings from being impacted and started using crypto savings products to increase his capital.

""I started using Binance Earn products which helped me to accrue interest on my assets, with far better rates than my bank account. It gave me the opportunity to make my own decisions – to stabilize my finances. I can't think of anything more empowering,"" said Aman.

More than a third of respondents shared that high fees (19%) and slow transaction times (14%) were the largest challenges when dealing with traditional financial systems and services.

Lauri, a Binance user, shared , ""I'm a digital nomad and constantly traveling, so Binance Pay has been a game-changer. I had to plan days ahead if I wanted to send money home, and it was expensive. I can transfer crypto through Binance Pay and it's there in like two minutes with barely any fees.""

Other Key Findings from the Survey:

Crypto for Earning Extra Income: Among respondents whose primary use for crypto is for earning extra income, 23% percent indicated that their goal was to supplement their primary income, with another 23% using it to save for a home and 21% for investing in other digital assets.

DUBAI, UAE, December 20, 2023 /EINPresswire / -- 2023 saw BNB Chain launch the opBNB and Greenfield blockchains, and add support at all stages of the development lifecycle with its Builder Support Program

Average DAU on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) increased by 126,000 in 2023, while opBNB exhibited the highest average DAU and transaction count among major L2s launched in H2 of 2023

BNB Chain, the community-driven blockchain ecosystem that includes the world's largest smart contract blockchain, has launched its 2023 Year in Review Campaign chronicling a landmark year that saw new blockchains introduced and Web3 builder support initiatives added across all stages of development. The campaign kicks off with a video recap from BNB Chain's avatar brand representative,'Nex'.

In 2023, BNB Chain launched its opBNB and BNB Greenfield blockchains on testnet, before taking both through to launch on their respective mainnets. Doubling transaction speeds and reducing fees by 30 times, opBNB reached 1.2 million within three months of mainnet launch. BNB Greenfield is empowering users to control and monetize their data and is positioned to underpin the rise of decentralized AI. These platforms work interoperably with BNB Smart Chain (BSC) according to BNB Chain's multichain and interoperability strategy to provide a streamlined user experience.

Both opBNB and BSC hit all-time highs for transactions in late 2023. While opBNB exceeded 23 million daily transactions on December 17, BSC recorded more than 32 million transactions on December 7. BSC demonstrated consistently low gas fees during this surge.

BNB Chain also made significant additions to its Web3 Builder Support Program this year. A Founder Track was added to the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program to incubate 100 new projects on BNB Chain. BNB Chain also ramped up its post-deployment support for projects this year, launching its TVL Incentive and DAU Incentive programs to offer up to $360,000 per month to projects continuing meaningful development post-deployment.

With these additions, BNB Chain now offers builder support at every stage of the development lifecycle. This even extends to pre-ideation, with BNB Chain holding a host of global hackathons in key markets to facilitate creativity and connection between builders. Following BNB Chain's Istanbul Hackathon in November, five new projects have already launched on BNB Chain.

Other highlights from 2023 include:

- The BNB Chain Innovation Roadshow: March saw a series of one-day events giving builders around the world the chance to learn new Web3 skills, get noticed, make connections and push their innovation to the next level.

-BNB Chain Hackvolution: In July this online hackathon challenged ​​developers, researchers and scientists to harness opBNB and BNB Greenfield to build next-gen dApps that push the boundaries of what is possible with Web3.

-BNB Chain Hackathon Istanbul: In November BNB Chain's Istanbul hackathon took place immediately following Binance Blockchain Week and offered up to $100,000 in rewards for impactful innovation across opBNB and BNB Greenfield.

Looking ahead to 2024, BNB Chain will continue to improve performance and the user experience to further lower barriers to entry for Web3.

DUBAI, UAE, Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --

Binance , the leading global blockchain ecosystem behind the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, today released its 2023 year-end report .

Binance shares:

The year 2023 has been a tumultuous one for crypto. Yet, even during the long periods of recovery, the building of valuable products and robust infrastructure in the Web3 space never stopped. We arrived at the end of this calendar year a stronger industry than we have ever been, having built a powerful momentum on the path to the mass adoption of digital assets.

As the industry leader, Binance has experienced the same headwinds and wins as the digital asset ecosystem at large, being influenced by – and often setting and helping to shape – some of the key trends that defined blockchain and crypto in 2023. From the rise of SocialFi to the burgeoning adoption of crypto payments, from the increased focus on compliance to the growing accessibility of Web3 products, Binance led the way, working hard to meet emerging user needs and build trust in digital assets globally.

In 2023, we welcomed more than 40 million new users, nearly a 30% increase from the end of last year, as well as saw steady growth in our key services, and introduced new products and features built for the next era of blockchain. We remained true to our core value – always putting our users first – and significantly strengthened our compliance program.

Its year-end report, ""State of The Blockchain: Binance's 2023 in Review,"" consolidates the key facts, stats, and narratives that describe the year's dynamics for Binance and the larger digital asset industry.

The People-Centric Web

The ultimate promise of blockchain and Web3 is to empower individuals through a more decentralized and user-centric online experience. Given Binance's focus on delivering maximum value to its users, the world's leading digital asset ecosystem continued to see strong growth in user registrations and wide adoption of its services geared toward real-world use cases and making Web3 more accessible.

By the end of 2023, Binance reached the mark of 170M registered users, offering 431 assets available for trading across 1785 trading pairs. This year, Binance saw tremendous growth in its services related to crypto payments, P2P trading, and earning. The number of people using Binance Pay or Card grew by 54 percent, served by over 3,500 new Pay merchants and partners globally who now accept crypto in exchange for goods and services.

Its P2P platform, which now supports 970 payment methods and 112 fiat currencies, processed 18 percent more trades than last year, and served 39 percent more users. Binance Earn also grew, now supporting 362 assets across its Simple Earn suite of products. In 2023, it served 35 percent more users than the year before, increasing the total value locked in its products by 16.8 percent.

Responding to the industry-wide demand for a more compelling Web3 social experience, Binance Feed evolved into Binance Square, a platform designed to be a gateway into the universe of Web3 content. Over the past year, Binance Square went from 1,200 to 11,000 creators and from under 700K to 1 active daily users.

Security and Compliance

Binance continued to invest in its compliance technology, processes, and talent, spending $213M in 2023, up 35 percent from the previous year's $158M. As of the end of the year, it holds licenses, registrations, and authorizations in 18 jurisdictions around the world – more than ever before.

Ramping up its collaboration with global crime fighters to tackle illicit activity involving digital assets, Binance responded to 58,000 law enforcement requests this year, held 120 training sessions to share expertise with law enforcement agents, and supported the authorities in solving a number of high-profile cases that resulted in criminals and terrorists getting arrested, billions in ill-gotten funds seized, and international criminal networks dismantled.

To further ensure the safety of its users, Binance furthered its platform security measures and ran a series of security-focused educational campaigns. At the end of the year, the value of its SAFU fund, designed to protect users in the case of emergencies, stood at $1.

Binance's proof-of-reserves (POR) system increased the number of supported assets from 9 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, allowing anyone to ensure that we always back user assets at a 1:1 ratio, plus additional reserves.

Making Web3 Accessible

In 2023, product and user experience improvements across decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, and SocialFi attracted new users into the universe of Web3 applications.

Responding to the demand for accessible and user-friendly gateways to the decentralized Web, Binance launched Binance Web3 Wallet – a self-custodial wallet integrated directly into the Binance app, allowing users to manage their crypto funds, execute token swaps across multiple chains, earn yields, and interact with a variety of blockchain platforms. In just a few weeks, Binance users have created millions of Web3 wallets.

Binance Labs, its venture capital and investment arm, continued to identify and support projects with demonstrated potential to unlock the benefits of Web3 and facilitate its mass adoption. This year, investments have focused on infrastructure and tooling powered by zero-knowledge proof cryptography, Web3 gaming, and innovations in DeFi. More than 2000 startups globally applied to participate in Binance Labs' incubation and acceleration programs in 2023, with 36 of them receiving support.

Binance shares: While our numbers look strong this year, it is something impossible to quantify that we consider our greatest achievement: maintaining the trust of our growing community, which is fundamental to our mission of advancing the freedom of money globally. In 2023, users came first for Binance – and they always will.

The action has been taken for alleged non-compliance with Indian anti-money laundering law. As per the notice sent out by FIU, these 9 crypto exchanges, which includes Binance and Kucoin, have been operating illegally in India. The nine exchanges that have received the show cause notice include, Binance, Kucoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfenex. 
'As part of compliance action against the offshore entities, Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU IND) has issued compliance Show Cause Notices to following nine offshore Virtual Digital Assets Service Providers (VDA SPs) under Section 13 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA),' the show cause notice reads.
Virtual digital asset service providers, whether operating within or outside India, involved in activities such as virtual digital asset-to-fiat currency exchanges, virtual digital asset transfers, safekeeping or administration of virtual digital assets, or facilitating control over virtual digital assets, must register with FIU India as a 'Reporting Entity.' They are obligated to adhere to the stipulated requirements mandated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002. 
'The regulation casts reporting, record keeping, and other obligations on the Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VDA SPs) under the PML Act which also includes registration with the FIU India,' the notice further reads.
As per the notice by FIU, as of now, 31 VDA SPs have completed registration with FIU India. Nonetheless, a number of offshore entities, despite serving a significant portion of Indian users, have been avoiding registration and thus falling outside the purview of the Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework.
The FIU India serves as the primary national agency tasked with everything from receiving, processing, analysing, to sharing information concerning suspicious financial transactions with enforcement agencies and foreign Financial Intelligence Units.
