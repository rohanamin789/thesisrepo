We also recorded our highest employee engagement through our survey platform with Mercer. We rolled-out promotion of our new brand campaign theme of ""Where You Bank Matters"", which captures the spirit of our vision to serve as a high-performing leading socially responsible community bank for all of our stakeholders.  I thank the entire Berkshire team for our success in 2022 and all they do to maintain our forward momentum in delivering on our vision.""RESULTS OF OPERATIONSEarnings:  Fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.69 increased from $0.42 in the prior quarter, while adjusted EPS increased by 2% from $0.62 to $0.64.  Adjusted results benefited from higher net interest income and lending related fee revenue. The increase in GAAP EPS also reflected a reduction in accrued branch consolidation expenses based on a reduction in total estimated costs.On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter results also increased from $0.42 reported for both GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS in 2021.  This improvement was primarily due to higher net interest income, which has reflected growth in loans and in the interest margin in each of the last several quarters. Fourth quarter revenue increased by 30% year-over-year, while expense growth was held to 1%. The resulting positive operating leverage led to an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 58% in the most recent quarter, compared to 62% in the linked quarter and to 72% in the fourth quarter of 2021.The fourth quarter 2022 return on equity measured 10.1% and the non-GAAP measure of adjusted return on tangible common equity measured 9.8%. The return on assets measured 1.08% and the non-GAAP measure of adjusted return on assets measured 1.00%.Pre-tax Pre-Provision Net Revenue (""PPNR"") increased quarter-over-quarter by 79% to $48 million and the non-GAAP measure of adjusted PPNR increased by 16% to $45 million. Adjusted PPNR more than doubled from $21 million on a year-over-year basis and moved within the Company's target range at the halfway point of its three year strategic plan.Revenue:  Revenue increased by 9% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year.  Net interest income has been the primary driver of revenue growth in recent periods.   Fourth quarter net interest income increased by $10 million, or 11%, compared to the linked quarter and by $33 million, or 47%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  The net interest margin has increased in successive quarters over the last year, reaching 3.84% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 3.48% in the prior quarter and 2.60% in the fourth quarter of 2021.This improvement was primarily due to the benefit of loan growth and positive sensitivity to increased market interest rates. The yield on average earning assets improved quarter-over-quarter to 4.56% from 3.91%.  The cost of funds increased to 0.77% from 0.46%, while the cost of deposits increased to 0.69% from 0.33%.  The Company's interest rate sensitivity remained positive at period-end and was positioned to benefit from further interest rate increases anticipated by the market.Fee income benefited quarter-over-quarter from a $1 million increase in loan related fees, which partially offset the impact of higher charges for tax credit investment amortization.  Fourth quarter fee income decreased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of lower SBA related fees in 2022 resulting from changes in the SBA program and in market demand.Provision for Credit Losses on Loans:  Berkshire recorded a $12 million provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2022, bringing the full year provision to $11 million.  The full year 2021 provision was a benefit of $0.5 million.  Both years benefited from releases of pandemic related reserves, and the increase in 2022 also reflected a resumption of loan growth and changes in the loan mix.  The fourth-quarter provision primarily reflected the impact of one commercial and industrial credit which filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter.Non-Interest Expense and Tax Expense:  Full year non-interest expense increased by 1% in 2022, while adjusted non-interest expense was flat.Fourth quarter non-interest expense totaled $70 million in 2022, decreasing by 14% quarter-over-quarter and increasing by 1% on a year-over-year basis due primarily to branch consolidation expense.  Fourth quarter adjusted  non-interest expense totaled $73 million which was a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 6% increase year-over-year.  Technology costs reflect continued investment in digitization and the category of all other expenses increased primarily due to loan related costs. Full time equivalent staff totaled 1,310 positions at period-end, compared to 1,319 positions at the start of the year.The effective GAAP tax rate was 15% in the final quarter and 19% for the year 2022, compared to 20% for the year 2021.   Due to the timing of tax credit investments, both tax expense and non-interest income were reduced in the fourth quarter.  These investments contributed $0.03 to EPS in the year 2022, compared to $0.02 in the year 2021.BALANCE SHEET (references are to period-end balances unless otherwise stated)Summary:  Total loans grew by 5% quarter-over-quarter and by 22% year-over-year. Total deposits increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.  Period-end liquidity and capital remained strong, with the ratio of loans/deposits measuring 81% and the non-GAAP measure of tangible common equity/tangible assets measuring 8.0%.Loans:  Fourth quarter loan growth was concentrated in a $231 million increase in commercial loans and a $183 million increase in residential mortgages.  For the full year, commercial loans increased by $640 million and residential mortgages increased by $824 million.  Berkshire has expanded its lending  teams over the last year, and business volumes and credit usage have benefited in some segments from improved market demand.   Loan growth has also benefited from a decline in prepayments in the prevailing rising rate environment.  All major loan categories increased by double digits in 2022 except for home equity loans.  Reflecting higher interest rates, the fourth quarter loan yield increased year-over-year to 5.28% from 3.76%.Asset Quality:   Total delinquent and non-accruing loans measured 0.60% of total loans at year-end, the lowest in more than a decade.  Reflecting the improved quality of the loan portfolio, the allowance for expected credit losses on loans declined to 1.15% of total loans from 1.21% at the start of the quarter.  Net loan charge-offs totaled $12 million in the fourth quarter and $21 million for the year, or 0.27% of full year average loans.  Charge-offs were concentrated in the second half of the year in one commercial and industrial credit which filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter.Deposits:  Total deposits increased by 3% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter including higher period-end payroll deposit balances.  Average deposits increased by 1% quarter-over-quarter and decreased by 2% year-over-year, including the impact of lower brokered time deposits. The fourth quarter cost of deposits increased year-over-year to 0.69% from 0.19%, including a 0.36% increase over the third quarter of 2022.Equity:  Total fourth quarter shareholders' equity increased quarter-over-quarter by 1% to $954 million.  Stock buybacks in the most recent quarter totaled approximately $20 million consisting of approximately 661,000 shares.  For the year 2022, stock repurchases totaled $125 million, consisting of 4.5 million shares.  At period-end, book value per share totaled $21.51 and the non-GAAP measure of tangible book value per share totaled $20.95; both measures increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter.ESG & CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY UPDATE Berkshire Bank is committed to purpose-driven, community-centered banking that enhances value for all stakeholders as it pursues its vision of being a high-performing, leading socially responsible community bank in New England and beyond.

26,Warren Buffett's 14-year bet pays off as Berkshire Hathaway cashes in on BYD,Insider,2023-02-02 00:00:00,date,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/02/02/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-cashes-in-on-byd-ev-automaker/,autoblog.com,"Warren Buffett's firm sold off more than 11 million shares in BYD last month, as it continues to reduce its holding in the Chinese EV maker.","Warren Buffett's firm has sold off more than 11 million shares in the EV maker in last month. AP Berkshire Hathaway cashed in at least $300 million of stocks in Chinese EV maker BYD last month, as it continues to cut its 14-year holding in Tesla's main Asian rival. Warren Buffett's investment firm announced in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing that it had sold off 1,554,500 shares in BYD on January 27, dropping its stake in the EV maker from 13.97% to 12.9%. Those numbers, however, don't fully capture Berkshire Hathaway's BYD stock sales over January, because the company only has to file when a transaction changes its percentage stake by a whole number. Data from the filing suggests a total 11,714,858 drop in Berkshire's BYD shares since its last announcement on January 3. BYD's lowest share price within that period was 201.6 Hong Kong Dollars ($25.70), meaning the investment firm has shed at least $301,071,850.60 of its stake in the company.  Berkshire has been involved in a gradual selloff of its BYD holdings, trimming its stake from 21.07% to the latest reported level of 12.9% in the space of two years. Buffett's investment firm has held a stake in BYD since 2008. The current value of Berkshire's holdings in BYD stands at around $4.7 billion, signalling a sizable gain on its initial investment of $232 million more than 14 years ago. The carmaker represents a small fraction of Berkshire's total portfolio. Shares in BYD are up about 30% so far this year on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, while Tesla has jumped more than 67% on the NASDAQ. However, BYD's losses last year of around 24% was much less severe than Tesla's 69%. BYD broke a record for EV sales in China last year, with its 1.9 million deliveries exceeding Tesla's by 600,000 in the country, as the Shenzhen-based company shrugged off the negative impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns.

27,AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company and Its Affiliates,,2023-02-01 00:00:00,date,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230201005693/en/AM-Best-Affirms-Credit-Ratings-of-Berkshire-Hathaway-Homestate-Insurance-Company-and-Its-Affiliates,businesswire.com,AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of 'aa+' (Superior),"February 01, 2023 09:35 AM Eastern Standard Time OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of 'aa+' (Superior) of Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company (Omaha, NE) and its five property/casualty affiliates. These companies collectively are referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See below for a detailed listing of companies.)

The ratings reflect BHHC's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. Additionally, these ratings consider the additional financial flexibility and support provided by the group's publicly traded parent and ultimate shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. [NYSE: BRK A and BRK B].

The ratings also reflect BHHC's consistently excellent risk-adjusted capitalization. Despite significant unrealized investment losses experienced in the first nine months of 2022 in the group's sizable equity portfolio, BHHC's risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), remains solidly supportive of the strongest overall balance sheet strength assessment. The group's ratings further recognize its historically profitable operating performance, conservative approach to setting loss reserves, strong liquidity metrics and the executive team's successful track record in managing operations. AM Best notes that BHHC's key operating metrics consistently outperform peer benchmarks, particularly when the group's long-term investment results are considered.

The positive rating factors are offset somewhat by challenging market conditions and BHHC's business profile, which remains somewhat concentrated in the workers' compensation line of business, primarily in California.

Approximately half of BHHC's direct writings in 2021 were derived from California. This concentration has diminished over time, as the group has seen its California workers' compensation business contract due to heightened competition that has persisted for several years. This decline has been accompanied by diversifying its workers' compensation book outside of California and strong growth in other business classes, including commercial auto and property lines. Nevertheless, the large block of California workers' compensation business still exposes the group to a heightened level of regulatory, judicial, legislative and competitive risks relative to its peers.

The group's long-tail focus also exposes BHHC's balance sheet to potential reserve volatility resulting from the currently high inflationary environment and reinforces the need for BHHC to maintain its historically prudent reserving practices. AM Best notes the favorable reserve development has been consistently and significantly additive to earnings for a prolonged period, and that any meaningful diminishment or reversal of this favorable trend could pressure the group's operating performance.

An additional offsetting rating factor is the risk associated with a large investment allocation in equity securities, which remains a potential source of volatility in earnings and capital appreciation.

The FSR of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of 'aa+' (Superior) have been affirmed with a stable outlook for Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company and its following property/casualty affiliates:


Cypress Insurance Company (San Francisco, CA)


Oak River Insurance Company (Omaha, NE)


Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance Company (Omaha, NE)


BHHC Special Risks Insurance Company (North Liberty, IA)


Continental Divide Insurance Company (Denver, CO)

28,Berkshire Sold Close to $10 Billion Worth of Stocks During Q4,Greggory Warren,2023-02-15 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1137942/berkshire-sold-close-to-10-billion-worth-of-stocks-during-q4,morningstar.com,"Taiwan Semiconductor, U.S. Bancorp, and Bank of New York Mellon stock comprised most of the reductions in the company's portfolio.","Wide-moat Berkshire Hathaway 
BRK.B
 reported a relatively busy fourth quarter for its equity investment portfolio, with net sales (exclusive of purchases) coming in at an estimated $9.7 billion based on the insurer's 13-F filing (as well as a similar filing for New England Asset Management, which managed $5.4 billion of equities for Berkshire at the end of December).
 
The biggest reductions on an absolute basis from the combined portfolios came from sales of Taiwan Semiconductor 
TSM
 (with Berkshire eliminating 51.8 million shares, or 86% of its holdings, for an estimated $3.7 billion), U.S. Bancorp 
USB
 (86.1 million shares, or 91% of its holdings, for an estimated $3.6 billion), and Bank of New York Mellon 
BK
 (37.4 million shares, or 60% of its holdings, for an estimated $1.6 billion).
 
Other activity included the trimming of stakes in Activision Blizzard 
ATVI
 (7.4 million shares for an estimated $560 million), Chevron (2.4 million shares for an estimated $390 million), and McKesson 
MCK
 (0.3 million shares for an estimated $120 million). Berkshire and NEAM raised another estimated $180 million reducing stakes in more than 40 smaller holdings, while the elimination of stakes in more than 60 other small holdings raised another $20 million.
 
Missing from the filings is Berkshire's sale of shares in BYD Company 
BYDDY
, the Chinese electric car maker. Since August of last year, the insurer has sold off more than one third of the 20.5% stake it has held since 2008, with the sale of another 4.2. million shares earlier this month, lowering its stake in BYD to around 12%.
 
Around $415 million of the proceeds generated during the fourth quarter were directed to stock purchases focused primarily on enhancing stakes in existing stock and ETF holdings. There were, however, three new money purchases during the period: KeyCorp 
KEY
 (0.3 million shares for an estimated $5 million), AT&T 
T
 (0.3 million shares for an estimated $5 million), and Alphabet Class A

The office is located in Downtown Geneva, within a short walk from the Geneva Metra stop as well as restaurants and night life. Geneva is part of the Tri-City-area along with Batavia and St. Charles.
 
Bauman said, ""Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago is an incredible company and Raul and I are proud to represent them in this expansion. I am honored to open this office in Geneva and serve the Tri-City-area that has become my home. I love the pleasant mingling that exists between the Batavia, Geneva and St. Charles communities and the plethora of activities that are available. We look forward to becoming immersed in the communities here and supporting them with our knowledge, commitment, drive and friendship. We recognize that no matter the market, people will always have important reasons to move. Our goal is to always help our clients along their real estate journey and be their advocate from start to finish.""
 
""Samantha and I love that we can go into a home and really have a conversation with people about life and why the client needs to buy or sell. At the end of the day for us, what moves us, what drives us, what truly inspires us to achieve unprecedented success for our clients is their ""Why"". I think clients who work with us feel that right away and it is what makes us authentic. Samantha and I love the opportunities that the Tri-City-area presents. We both come from a hospitality background, so our drive to serve and work ethic are very strong. As everyone knows, real estate is a local business and we feel that to be successful in a community, you really must be part of it. Now, with the office presence in Geneva and Samantha living in Batavia, we are committed to these communities and are excited to become an integral part of them,"" said Delgado.
 
Pasquesi said, ""Samantha and Raul have been exceptional agents in our Wheaton office, and we are truly delighted to see them spread their wings and expand to Geneva. It is the perfect fit for them as brokers, and for us as a company. We wish them tremendous success in this new venture and are here to support them in any way we can.""
 
Bauman and Delgado became partners in 2021 and never looked back. That year the team received the Chairman's Circle Platinum Award which placed them among the top 1% of brokers in the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices national network. As The Move Smarter Team expands their presence to Geneva, the team will now be able to better serve communities further west of Wheaton including Geneva, Batavia, St. Charles, West Chicago, North Aurora, Aurora, Sugar Grove and Elburn. The Geneva office is open by appointment and is supported by the BHHS Chicago Wheaton office where Samantha and Raul are top producing agents.

Samantha has been a broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Wheaton office for almost seven years and prior to that worked in the hospitality industry in catering and event planning for more than 10 years. Just recently, Samantha and her two children moved from Wheaton to Batavia, which created the spark to open an office in Geneva. She has played a big role in the Wheaton community for many years, serving on the board of the DuPage County Historical Museum Foundation and as an active member of the Wheaton Chamber, and she looks forward to her next chapter in her new hometown.
 
Previously, Delgado was General Manager of Bon Appetit Management Company that runs all the food operations for Wheaton College. While there, he hired Bauman as his Director of Catering. They spoke a common language, shared a relentless passion for serving people and strived to be different and better to wow clients, an approach that led Wheaton College to be ranked the #1 college dining program in the country by the Princeton Review. Results like that have followed Delgado and Bauman into their real estate careers. A Wheaton resident, Raul was born and raised in Flossmoor. He is an active member of the Wheaton Chamber and the Wheaton Lion's Club. He has a daughter and two stepsons, all in college.

Here's what's ahead on this week's 
Investing Insights. 
Warren Buffett's portfolio took a hit. What Morningstar thinks about Berkshire Hathaway. Plus, one of the world's biggest chipmakers is cutting its quarterly dividend. And, how investors can benefit from the rising popularity of AI-powered chatbots. Research from Morningstar's team will explain how.
 
This is 
Investing Insights
.
 
Welcome to 
Investing Insights
. I'm your host, Ivanna Hampton. Let's get started with a look at the Morningstar headlines.
 
Berkshire Hathaway's Rocky Results
 
Market volatility rocked the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio.
 
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway 
BRK.B
 reported solid operating revenue that offset unrealized losses from investments. And the results from the company's latest earnings report lined up with Morningstar's expectations. But its full-year revenue dropped about a third in 2022. And fourth-quarter revenue also fell due to weaker investment portfolio performance. That includes the gains and losses of the holding company's investment and derivative portfolios.
 
Morningstar figures Berkshire entered 2023 with about $94 billion in cash that it could use for investments, acquisitions, or share buybacks. Morningstar doesn't expect to change its estimate of the shares' worth and views the stock as undervalued.
 
Domino's Trims Outlook
 
Domino's 
DPZ
 has cut its sales growth and unit-development outlook for the next two to three years. The pizza chain's lower expectations validate Morningstar's belief that worsening restaurant profitability and higher construction and financing costs would hurt most of its store operators' unit development for some time. Domino's quarterly results were mixed. The company's almost $1.4 billion in sales was in line with Morningstar's forecast.
 
But earnings per share fell slightly short of expectations. Strong cost controls and gradual growth from refranchising dozens of stores should help operating margins in 2023. Inflation and customers' reluctance to pay higher prices should make this year challenging for restaurant owners. Domino's carryout business remains its key growth engine. The pizza chain remains Morningstar's top restaurant-industry pick with an estimated stock worth of $397.
 
Intel Cuts Quarterly Dividend
 
Intel 
INTC
 is cutting its quarterly dividend by two thirds. Weak demand for personal computers and strong pressure from rival Advanced Micro Devices, or 
AMD
, have hurt the chipmaker. Morningstar supports Intel's integrated device-manufacturing strategy known as 'IDM 2.0.' This dividend cut is necessary given the capital-expenditure requirements of Intel's turnaround plan. Its dividend yield surpassed 5% before the cut. That would have been tough to maintain. Morningstar estimates at least $20 billion in capital expenditures for Intel this year. The chipmaker's dividend payouts are better served investing in new technologies and research and development. Intel expects to save billions through the end of 2025 through layoffs, marketing cuts, and temporary salary reductions. These actions could lead to underinvesting in key areas and losing top talent. Morningstar still thinks Intel's stock is worth $35 and undervalued. However, competitor AMD looks like the better option since it's expected to perform better despite the softer macroeconomic conditions.
 
Investing in AI
 
The popularity of an AI-powered chatbot known as ChatGPT is surging. It's delivering humanlike responses, and sometimes it makes headlines for them. The chatbot's arrival also seems to have intensified the clash among two tech titans. You might be wondering how to invest in AI technology. Morningstar's data journalist Jakir Hossain has talked with Morningstar analysts about that. Jakir is joining 
Investing
 
Insights.
 
Hampton:
 Jakir, OpenAI created ChatGPT. It has potentially kicked off an AR arms race, and this thing has gone viral. Let's start off with what ChatGPT is and how does it work?
 
Jakir Hossain: 
ChatGPT is an artificial intelligent language model, which is just the fancy term to explain that it takes in a lot of data and analyzes that data in order to figure out the relationship between words so that it can understand how to then respond to a user prompt in the most logical and sensical way that it's capable of. And so with ChatGPT you can ask it a question, and it'll look back at all the datasets that it's been trained on, and try to figure out what's a suitable response to that.
 
Hampton:
 Now, Microsoft 
MSFT
 has announced that it's going to invest billions of dollars in OpenAI and then Google followed up and unveiled its own chatbot, Bard AI. What do Morningstar analysts say about how these companies are going to use these chatbots?
 
Hossain:
 In my conversation with some of our technology analysts, right now Google and Microsoft are in the center when it comes to artificial intelligence, largely because of Microsoft's stake in OpenAI and Google developing their own Bard AI, as you mentioned. Both of these are companies I own, and so I've been keeping a close eye to see how they've been incorporating this technology into their products and services. And right now it's really just been focused on integrating it with search to try and make that better and then basically make their search engines a lot more competitive and engaging to users.
 
So for example, Microsoft has released a public beta of sorts, where their search engine, Bing, is now being powered by AI and you can interact with it in the same way that you can with the ChatGPT research platform. Google hasn't quite yet done the same, but I wouldn't be surprised if they put that out eventually.
 
And so the question between these two companies right now is, Is Microsoft going to be able to challenge Google in the search market—because Google dominates that field? Are dynamics going to change? How are they going to change? Those are the big questions that investors are facing when it comes to those two in AI right now.
 
Hampton:
 Companies like Salesforce 
CRM
 and Adobe 
ADBE
, they're also using AI. Can you describe how they're doing it?
 
Hossain:
 Similar to Google and Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce—and Salesforce is another company that I own—they're mostly using artificial intelligence in order to enhance their existing products and features. And so for example, Adobe has this AI that they call Adobe Sensei, and that's been weaved into a lot of programs like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator. And the purpose behind it is to help users automate some of the more monotonous tasks that they have to do when using programs like Photoshop.
 
So, for example, for somebody who's trying to edit a photo, let's say you wanted to remove something from a digital image because somebody photobombed your picture or something like that, you can remove it, but it's going to leave a gap there. And so Adobe Sensei can help the editor figure out—it's basically going to analyze the entire picture and figure out—OK, what's a suitable color or texture or background to fill this gap up with so that the picture looks natural, and it's using AI to power that feature.
 
Likewise, Salesforce has their AI platform, is called Salesforce Einstein, and that's dedicated to providing users more features that allow them to predict if they're going to be able to convert a sales lead into a reoccurring customer, figure out what's the probability of being able to bring a customer, purchase a higher tier of whatever product and service they're trying to sell, as well as optimize search results for customers to expose them to products that they might be interested in.
 
Hampton: 
Artificial intelligence has been around for some time. What are some thoughts within Morningstar about this new phase of AI?
 
Hossain: 
In my conversation, we've thought that artificial intelligence is something that we've actually had for quite some time. Our analysts say that products like Siri, Alexa, and even Google Search, which has to this day, over the last few years really, has been using artificial intelligence to help power its search results. We've been using AI in a much more subtle way.
 
But right now with the release of ChatGPT and the announcement of Bard AI, we're entering a new era where artificial intelligence is a lot more interactable, in that with ChatGPT, you can type in a response and get a humanlike response back. Users can actually interact with AI in ways that they haven't been able to with Siri and Alexa to the same degree.
 
And so it's exciting, but in talking with our analysts, we think that this is still very much in the first inning. ChatGPT, Bard AI, these things are exciting, but we really think this technology has gotten started. So I think we have a lot left to figure out and see what's next.
 
Hampton: 
Your article suggested investors focus on suppliers than the companies using AI in their products. What do Morningstar analysts say about how to take advantage of AI technology right now?
 
Hossain:
 Just to give a bit of background on that: Like I mentioned before, artificial intelligence right now, the focus is figuring out a way for companies to incorporate it in order to enhance their existing products and services. And so our analysts don't really see a huge revenue opportunity in artificial intelligence just yet because incorporating AI in the case of Adobe Sensei, that may not necessarily be a new stream of revenue for Adobe. It's going to make their products more compelling and competitive perhaps, but it's not necessarily going to bring up their sales numbers.
 
And so right now, the field that they've identified as where most of the money for artificial intelligence from an investing standpoint is going is going to be in the semiconductor industry. And that's because artificial intelligence requires a lot of advanced computing resources and the focus and the primary contributor to that is going to be advanced semiconductors known as graphics processing units, GPUs, or sometimes called graphics cards. And there's three main companies that produce these, which is Nvidia 
NVDA
, another company that I own, AMD, and Intel. And among those three, Nvidia stands out the most, largely because it is producing graphics cards that are the most competitive for AI workloads and even their latest product offering in the data center in AI space, they release graphics cards under the Hopper Family Architecture. That graphics card is optimized for AI workloads. And so that's something that companies looking to build up their own AI infrastructure, they're buying those graphics cards in order to produce that.
 
AMD and Intel both do offer graphics cards that are capable of helping with AI solutions. But in the case of AMD, although they've been competitive with Nvidia for almost two decades, they only just entered the data center and artificial intelligence space about in 2020. And Intel really just entered the graphics card market very recently. I think they only launched their first graphics card last summer.
 
And so right now, in terms of opportunities even within the semiconductor industry, our analyst sees Nvidia as the top pick for people who think there's going to be a lot of AI spending because they're producing the most competitive graphics cards for those workloads.
 
But that being said, Nvidia is also currently fairly valued. So we do not think that if investors are looking to open a position in Nvidia, right now the stock is just trading just at fair value. And so they might want to wait until it pulls back a little. AMD and Intel on the other hand, are undervalued. And so, although they're not as exposed to AI workloads, they do benefit from that trend. And so investors might want to look at that as well.
 
Hampton:
 All right, Jakir, thank you for joining me on Investing Insights.
 
Hossain:
 Thanks for having me.

 You could miss out on compounding growth if you make IRA contributions at the last-minute. Here's Morningstar's director of personal finance Christine Benz with Vanguard's Maria Bruno. They talk about how to avoid the so-called 'procrastination penalty.'
 
Christine Benz: 
Hi. I'm

 from Morningstar. Some investors rush in their 
IRA contributions right before the deadline

Maria, thank you so much for being here.
 
Maria Bruno:
 Hi, Christine. Good to be here. Thank you.
 
Benz: 
So, let's talk about this issue of investors waiting until the eleventh hour to make their 
IRA contributions
, getting them in right before the tax-filing deadline. You and I have discussed in the past, Maria, that this is kind of a phenomenon that you see. Is this something that you're continuing to see this year, for example?
 
Bruno:
 We do, Christine, but we're seeing some really encouraging trends. Again, we're looking at the 2021 tax year. And what we're seeing is that more contributions are coming in early in the tax-filing year.

BRK.B
 reported fourth-quarter and full-year results that were basically in line with our expectations, so we don't expect to alter our fair value estimate of $555,000 for the A shares and $370 for the B shares. We view the shares as being moderately undervalued.
 
For the fourth quarter, revenue, including realized and unrealized gains and losses from Berkshire's investment and derivative portfolios, declined 17.6% to $92.6 billion from $112.4 billion in the prior-year period on a marked decrease in gains from the investment portfolio. For the full year, revenue declined 34.0% to $234.2 billion from $354.7 billion in 2021. Excluding the impact of investment and derivative gains and losses and other adjustments, operating revenue increased 8.7% to $78.2 billion for the quarter and 9.4% to $302.1 billion for the year.
 
Year over year, operating earnings, excluding the impact of investment and derivative gains and losses, declined 7.9% to $6.7 billion for the quarter and increased 12.2% to $30.8 billion for the year. When including the impact of the investment and derivative gains and losses, operating earnings declined to $18.2 billion from $39.6 billion in the fourth quarter and to negative $22.8 billion from $89.8 billion for the year.
 
Book value per share by our estimates increased 4.2% sequentially to $323,593 from $310,652 at the end of September, below our forecast of $329,255, which included more of a contribution from the investment portfolio than was reported for the fourth quarter.
 
The company closed the year with $128.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down from $146.7 billion at the end of 2021, despite putting $34.3 billion (net of sales) in stock purchases and paying $11.5 billion to acquire Alleghany.

34,Berkshire investors would do better if the firm was broken up. It's time for Warren Buffett to step aside,David Olive,2023-03-02 00:00:00,date,https://www.thestar.com/business/opinion/2023/03/02/berkshire-investors-would-do-better-if-the-firm-was-broken-up-its-time-for-warren-buffett-to-step-aside.html,thestar.com,"No one today would build a jumble of companies like Berkshire, David Olive writes.","It's time for Warren Buffett, 92, to retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and let a successor get on with dismantling the world's largest conglomerate.

Last weekend, Berkshire reported an enormous loss in 2022 of $22.8 billion (U.S.) on $302 billion in revenues. That is not the first time in recent years that Berkshire's profits have collapsed.

And Berkshire's stock performance has trailed the market averages for the past two decades.

The stock market always applies a discount to conglomerate stocks, because routinely the stars in a conglomerate's holdings are dragged down by the dogs.

Last year at Berkshire, impressive gains in its power utilities business were outweighed by huge losses in its stock portfolio, reversals in some of its insurance units, and bad bets on derivatives.

Berkshire investors would do better if the firm was broken up, a process Wall Street calls 'unlocking shareholder value.'

The market currently values Berkshire at $669 billion.

The collective value of Berkshire's components if the company spun off its hundreds of diverse enterprises would be closer to $800 billion.

Conglomerates went out of style in the 1990s, with the dismantling of BCE Enterprises, EdperBrascan and Canadian Pacific Enterprises. Their components thrived as standalone companies.

More recently, Bombardier Inc. finally achieved viability as a focused maker of private jets after shedding its diverse albatrosses.

Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and Canadian National Railway Co., both formerly yoked to conglomerates, each outperformed Berkshire's BNSF Railway last year, increasing their profits while BNSF's financials weakened.

As noted, major setbacks have become a norm at Berkshire.

In 2018, Berkshire's profit plummeted by 91 per cent. In 2020, it fell by 48 per cent.

And Berkshire stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five, 10 and 20 years.

No one today would build a jumble of companies like Berkshire, which came about somewhat by accident.

During the prolonged stock-market slump of the 1970s and early 1980s, Buffett was able to buy corporate assets on the stock market for 50 cents on the dollar.

Then the market roared back to life, the value of Buffett's acquisitions skyrocketed, and the niagara of cash they produced had to be reinvested. Berkshire grew like Topsy.

In the past 20 years, though, bargains have been hard to find in an overvalued stock market.

Berkshire has a succession plan. Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice-chair, is Buffett's current heir apparent. But Buffett has lost faith in previous likely successors.

Meanwhile, Buffett clings to a job that enables him, like Zeus, to cast thunderbolts across the economy with his massive acquisitions and big bets in the stock and derivative markets.

And Buffett and his long-time partner, Berkshire vice-chair Charlie Munger, 99, make those decisions on their own.

The board of the Buffett-controlled Berkshire is stacked with Buffett appointees, including his son Howard and daughter Susan.

Any CEO would struggle to maximize performance at all of Berkshire's 300-plus businesses.

They include gas pipelines, candy, aircraft components, Dairy Queen, interstate truck stops, Duracell batteries, movie distribution, computer equipment, Benjamin Moore paints, and furniture and apparel brands.

And a renowned stock investor who left Berkshire exposed to last year's stock-market rout is difficult to regard as risk-averse, which Buffett declares himself to be.

It's too easy to find companies with better 10-year stock performances than Berkshire, whose shares have almost tripled in value since 2013, or up by 195 per cent.

Investors would have done better with Google parent Alphabet (up 350 per cent), Montreal computer services provider CGI (up 347 per cent), or Vancouver yoga-togs merchant Lululemon Athletica (up almost 400 per cent).

Berkshire's shares would trade a bit lower than their current price if Berkshire hadn't spent upward of $60 billion buying back its shares over the past two years, inflating their value.

Buybacks are controversial of late, with Ottawa and Washington angered that the money isn't instead reinvested in job-creating expansion or innovating R&D.

Buffett is impatient with buyback critics, who in the main are 'economic illiterates' or 'silver-tongued demagogues,' he says in his latest chairman's letter to shareholders.

Not coincidentally, U.S. President Joe Biden is asking Capitol Hill to quadruple the levy on corporate share repurchases. Ottawa is planning its own levy on share buybacks.

Berkshire fans complain that Buffett's letters have been getting shorter and less detailed and folksy in recent years.

In his latest letter, Buffett does reflect on his 58 years of investing, allowing that he has made only 'about a dozen truly good decisions.' And that otherwise his capital allocations during that span have 'been no better than so-so.'

The inevitable dismantling of Berkshire, to surface the true value of its components, is too arduous a task for Buffett. The way to prove that his modesty is not false is to step aside to let that investor-friendly process begin under new Berkshire leadership.

AP Images
 
 
 
Elon Musk has suggested Warren Buffett should buy 
Tesla
 stock, and revealed Charlie Munger had the chance to invest in the automaker at less than 0.1% of its current valuation.
 
Twitter user @gurgavin 
posted
 on Saturday that Buffett and Munger's 
Berkshire Hathaway
 had 
over $128 billion in cash
 at the end of 2022, and asked which stocks the conglomerate should spend its money on.
 
""Starts with a T …"" Musk 
replied
.
 
""Munger could've invested in Tesla at ~$200M valuation when I had lunch with him in late 2008,"" he 
added
.
 
Musk's tweet suggests that Munger — Buffett's 99-year-old business partner and Berkshire's vice-chairman — could have bought, say, 5% of Tesla for a measly $10 million in 2008.
 
Tesla went public two years later, securing a roughly $2 billion valuation. Its market capitalization skyrocketed during the pandemic, peaking at over $1.2 trillion in November 2021. The electric-vehicle company was still worth $617 billion as of Friday's close.
 
Assuming Munger invested in 2008 and never sold any shares (and ignoring any dilution), he would have made 10 times his money on paper by the time of Tesla's IPO. Moreover, his 5% stake would have briefly been worth $60 billion in November 2021 — 6,000 times his initial investment, and approaching 10% of Berkshire's entire market capitalization and 60% of Buffett's net worth.
 
While Tesla stock has roughly halved since then, Munger's hypothetical position would still be worth about $31 billion today, or more than 3,000 times his original wager.
 
In reality, Munger declined to bet on Tesla in 2008, and instead spearheaded Berkshire's 
$232 million investment in BYD
 that year. Berkshire's stake in the Chinese EV maker and Tesla rival ballooned in value to over $7 billion by early 2021, and the company has cashed in 
well over $1 billion
 of BYD stock in recent months.
 
Munger and Buffett have never publicly invested in Tesla, but both men have weighed in on Musk and his car company.
 
Munger, 99, 
recently described
 Musk as a ""very talented man but also peculiar,"" and said he neither invests nor bets against the executive's companies. He's also 
underscored
 Musk's positive contributions to civilization, and labeled Tesla's survival in the brutally competitive automotive industry a ""minor miracle.""
 
Buffett has also 
hailed
 Musk and Tesla's unlikely success. While Musk has noted he 
isn't the investor's biggest fan
 and considers running Berkshire to be a pretty boring job, he's also 
acknowledged
 Buffett's skill and valuable role in the US economy.
 
It seems unlikely that Buffett and Munger will invest in Tesla anytime soon, given they own a chunk of a rival automaker, and have shied away from aggressively valued technology companies in the past. But Musk would clearly welcome their 
vote of confidence
, and seems happy to give Munger a second chance to buy his stock.

As more complex, large-molecule biologics and other therapeutics enter the market, the demand for protecting products that are sensitive to temperature, light, and shear grows. BSM hopes to help sponsors with sensitive drug products, such as biologics, AAV and oligonucleotides, understand the options available to them to protect their product during formulation, filling, storage, and distribution.
 
BSM will cover topics such as how to keep drug products cool while formulating and filling in ambient cleanrooms, how to protect light sensitive product during formulation and filling, and how filtration and pumping actions affect shear-sensitive products.
 
On March 15, BSM will discuss a typical fill finish process and implications for sensitive drug products. They will also describe modifications that can be made to protect shear, light, and temperature-sensitive drug products, and what happens after the product leaves your fill finish site. BSM will also detail options available to sponsors to protect their sensitive drug product.
 
The event, 
Aseptic filling of unstable drug products, 
is free to attend, and those interested can register for the webinar here:

39,Financial Sector Stock Outlook: Berkshire the Usual Stalwart,Michael Wong,2023-04-03 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1148438/financial-sector-stock-outlook-berkshire-the-usual-stalwart,morningstar.com,"Blackstone, Citigroup also stand out within a more cautious banking landscape.","The Morningstar US Financial Services Index significantly underperformed the Morningstar US Markets Index over the previous year, down 14.3% compared with 9.6% for the benchmark. Quarter to date, the sector is down 5.71% compared with the market's gain of 3.83%. The median North American financial sector stock trades at a 15% discount to its fair value estimate compared to a 10% discount at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 1% discount at the end of the first quarter of 2022. We currently rate over 50% of the North American financial sector stocks that we cover as undervalued 5- or 4-star stocks with less than 10% rated overvalued 2- and 1-star stocks.
 
Financial sector stocks have recently fallen due to fear stemming from the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Credit Suisse. We broadly put the fear into 2 categories: 1) liquidity and solvency 2) long-term profitability. In terms of liquidity and solvency, banks are holding higher-quality assets and the financial system is better capitalized to absorb any losses than during the global financial crisis. The recently established Bank Term Funding Program by the U.S. Federal Reserve and emergency measures to make all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank whole provides liquidity to the banking system and reassurance to depositors.
 
 
 
While the U.S. financial system is sturdy, we believe that financial institutions will be cautious in the near to medium term, which could pressure profits. A commonly cited forward indicator of a recession is the inversion of the yield curve. We can see that on a monthly basis, the effective federal-funds rate has been higher than the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield since December 2022.
 
 
 
To prepare for a recession, banks will likely tighten lending standards that reduces loan growth and the availability of credit to the economy. To further shore up liquidity, banks may invest in lower-yielding short-term securities and pay more for funding. Time deposit balances have increased more than 40% from their 2022 low and the rate paid on certificates of deposits have steadily increased. Outside of the banking industry, we see less fallout from Silicon Valley Bank with indirect effects from recently lower asset prices, higher probability of a recession, and potentially lower peak interest rates.

Citigroup is one of the most undervalued U.S. banks under our coverage and is trading below tangible book value.

, owing to its diversification and lower overall risk profile, offers one of the better risk-adjusted return profiles in the financial-services sector and remains a generally solid candidate for downside protection during market selloffs. We remain impressed by Berkshire's ability in most years to generate high-single- to double-digit growth in book value per share, comfortably above our estimate of its cost of capital. We also believe that it will take some time before the company finally succumbs to the impediments created by the sheer size and scale of its operations, and that the ultimate departure of Warren Buffett and Charles Munger will have less of an impact on future operating results than many investors believe. We view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators for the company.
 
Key Morningstar Metrics for Berkshire Hathaway Stock
 

 
We believe that Berkshire's economic moat is more than just a sum of its parts, although the parts that make up the whole are fairly moaty in their own regard. The insurance operations—Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group—remain important contributors to the overall business. Not only do they account for about 25% of Berkshire's pretax earnings (and 46% of our current valuation of the company), but they are overcapitalized and generate low-cost float. These temporary cash holdings, which arise from premiums being collected in advance of future claims, have allowed Berkshire to generate additional returns as the company invests these funds in assets that are commensurate with the duration of the business being underwritten. And they have tended to come at little to no cost to Berkshire, given the company's proclivity for generating underwriting gains the past several decades.

Fair Value Estimate for Berkshire Hathaway Stock
 
Our fair value estimate for Berkshire is derived using a sum-of-the-parts methodology, valuing each of the company's operating segments separately and then adding them together for the total estimate. We value the Class A shares at $555,000 and the Class B shares at $370. This is equivalent to 1.45 and 1.33 times our estimates for Berkshire's book value per share at the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively. For some perspective, the shares have traded at an average of 1.41 times trailing calendar quarter-end book value per share during the past five years and 1.44 times during the past 10 years. We use a 9.0% cost of equity in our valuation and assume that Berkshire pays a minimum of 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for taxable years beginning in 2023.
 
Read more about Berkshire Hathaway's fair value estimate.
 
Risk and Uncertainty
 
Our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Berkshire is Low. We don't consider any environmental, social, or governance issues at the company to be material enough at this point to affect our uncertainty rating, primarily because of the company's lower exposure to some of the main ESG risks inherent to the industries where it competes. However, Berkshire has generally scored lower on governance issues because of the makeup of its board and board committees, the unequal voting structure of its shares, and the lack of engagement and opaqueness on governance issues historically.

Bulls Say
 
Book value per share, which is a good proxy for measuring changes in Berkshire's intrinsic value, increased at an estimated 18.3% compound annual growth rate during 1965-2022, compared with a 9.9% return for the S&P 500 TR Index.
Berkshire's stock performance has generally been solid, increasing at a 9.5% CAGR during 2018-22 and 13.3% during 2013-22, compared with 9.4% and 12.6% respective average annual returns for the S&P 500 TR Index.
At the end of 2022, Berkshire had approximately $164 billion in insurance float. The cost of its float has been negative for much of the past two decades.
 
Bears Say
 
Given its size, Berkshire's biggest long-term hurdle will be its ability to consistently find deals that not only add value but are large enough to be meaningful.
Another big issue facing the company is the longevity of chair and CEO Warren Buffett (who turns 93 at the end of August) and managing partner Charlie Munger (who turned 99 in January).
Berkshire's insurance business faces competitive and highly cyclical markets that occasionally produce large losses, and several of its noninsurance operations are economically sensitive and focused on U.S. markets.

: Here's what's ahead on this week's Investing Insights. Omaha, Nebraska, will sit in the center of the investing universe this weekend. The Morningstar senior stock analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway will join the podcast. Plus, what Morningstar analysts think about a trio of tech titans' stocks following earnings. And learn about four great dividend funds that could suit your portfolio. This is Investing Insights.
 
Welcome to Investing Insights. I'm your host, Ivanna Hampton. Let's get started with a look at the Morningstar headlines.
 
Meta Reports Growth
 
Facebook and Instagram parent Meta has reported first-quarter growth. The results confirm Morningstar's view that the company has figured out ways to make money off Reels, Meta's rival to TikTok. It also has improved ad conversions, and that could include users clicking on an ad, watching a video, or buying something via an ad. Morningstar still expects the social-media giant to expand margins in 2024 and has raised revenue projections. Reels impressions and ad prices have improved. Cannibalization of other ads on Instagram could end by early 2024. Reels has helped increase time spent on Meta apps, and that should further increase ad demand. Meta is increasing ad-conversions despite Apple's privacy policy changes. This reduces its dependence on data from others. Morningstar commends the firm for shifting its short-and medium-term focus toward increased efficiency, and the move will help increase capital for share buybacks and reinvesting in artificial intelligence. Morningstar has raised its estimate of Meta's worth by nearly $20 to $278 and views its shares as undervalued.
 
Microsoft Delivers Strong Fiscal Third Quarter
 
Microsoft reported a strong fiscal third quarter with positives on both the top and bottom lines. The tech company's revenue grew 7% year over year to almost $53 billion, topping expectations. Important areas like Azure and Microsoft 365 delivered results above Morningstar's expectations, and the results are reinforcing the analyst's long-term position. Management's outlook for the June quarter is above Morningstar's view, despite macroeconomic pressures that include the banking crisis. Morningstar continues to center growth assumptions on Azure, Microsoft 365 E5 migration, and traction with the Power Platform for long-term value creation. Investors will likely have a call option on artificial intelligence in shares of Microsoft. That said, it remains unknown if enterprise software vendors are out of the woods yet from a macro perspective. Morningstar is lifting its estimate of Microsoft's stock's worth from $310 to $325 per share and sees the stock as slightly undervalued.
 
E-Commerce and Advertising Growth Drove Amazon's Results
 
E-commerce and advertising growth drove Amazon's first-quarter results. The online retailer delivered better-than-expected revenue that rose 9% year over year. Yet, the e-commerce giant saw continued slowing revenue growth in its cloud platform known as Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Management pointed to customer optimization efforts. Microsoft is also seeing the trend, but Microsoft and Amazon expect these efforts to start easing by midyear. Morningstar is impressed that Amazon's advertising revenue growth outpaced Meta and Alphabet. Amazon's second-quarter outlook surpasses what Morningstar was expecting. In the long term, Morningstar still sees e-commerce, AWS, and advertising driving healthy growth for the tech company. However, the near term remains a work in progress. Macroeconomic conditions are sending mixed signals. Morningstar still estimates Amazon's shares are worth $137 each and thinks the stock is cheap.
 
Southwest Airlines' Rough Results
 
Southwest Airlines' first-quarter results arrived as expected. The Dallas-based carrier reported a net loss tied to extra costs and $325 million in lost revenue due to its holiday travel meltdown. It canceled more than 16,000 flights because of system issues in late December. Management announced it will receive 70 new 737s from Boeing instead of 90 this year. Southwest has scaled back its capacity expansion plans for 2023 as a result. It's expected to miss out on potential revenue from the loss of billions of available seat miles. Airlines use the metric to track a plane's capacity to generate revenue. Morningstar thinks Southwest faces a problem in the short run. The costs of running an airline, like lease agreements and labor and vendor contracts, are fixed. And Southwest will have fewer revenue-generating flights, miles, and passengers to cover those costs. Morningstar has lowered Southwest's stock worth to $54.
 
Berkshire Hathaway's Annual Meeting
 
Berkshire Hathaway will host tens of thousands of investors this weekend. Its annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for Saturday. Investing legends Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are expected to share their insights. Morningstar Research Services' senior stock analyst Gregg Warren covers Berkshire Hathaway, and he's joining Investing Insights.
 
Gregg, you served on the panel at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meetings for several years. Can you briefly talk about that?
 
Gregg Warren
: The panel was an interesting addition that Berkshire brought in. They actually started about 15 years ago. They brought in a journalist panel in ‘09 with three journalists, and then they brought in the analyst panel, the first one, in 2012. And the idea behind that was Buffett felt that shareholders weren't asking enough company-specific questions, things that would allow them to talk about what was going on with the firm, the operations, what their expectations were. Granted, they were asking a lot of questions about macro events and other things, which he loves to talk about, but he really wanted to showcase a lot of things with Berkshire. So, he figured bringing in some journalists, bringing in some analysts, would help keep the meeting focused on a lot of Berkshire-specific things.
 
We were fortunate enough to be on the panel for six years up until the final year in 2019, but they decided—COVID interrupted everything, but even before that, they had decided to move away from the analyst panel because there was a lot of feedback from shareholders wanting to see Ajit Jain and Greg Abel up on stage with Warren and Charlie because these are the guys heading the two big pieces of the business right now, and Greg is the heir apparent. So they really wanted to get some interjection from them during the course of the meetings. And unfortunately the analyst panel was the sacrifice that was made.
 
But it is interesting because COVID interrupted things so much that they ended up actually eliminating the journalist panel as well. And now it's basically Becky Quick fielding questions from outside of Berkshire, from shareholders, and then feeding those in and then shareholders asking questions as well. During the time we were on the panel, we thought it was a good addition. We as the analysts and the journalists were only allowed to have six questions during the course of the meeting. And we would try to really hone in on either company-specific issues, like what's going on with Geico or what's going on with Burlington Northern, or capital allocation decisions. I think we really spent a lot of time the last few years that we were doing the panel trying to get Buffett to give us firmer decisions or at least understandings about dividend, share purchases, and other capital allocation decisions.
 
Questions for Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger
 
Hampton
: So what are you listening for at this weekend's meeting?
 
Warren
: It's always interesting. I mean, at a higher level when we look at Berkshire, we see it as a big decentralized operation, and that has both opportunities and problems associated with it. So when we're looking at the business, we're trying to understand where the operating businesses are, what the key competitive pressures are right now, and then also looking at capital allocation decisions. Because Berkshire's had this problem the past 10, 15 years where they continually have a lot of cash build up on the balance sheet. It's a great problem to have, but for the years that interest rates were near zero, it really wasn't helping drive returns for the business. As we look forward to this year's meeting, it's a couple of standby questions that continue to come up. One is on Geico; they're really struggling relative to Progressive, which we feel is probably the best comparable for them.
 
The auto insurance industry overall has been a mess post COVID, just up and down. And right now with all the inflationary costs on auto parts and car replacements, it's just been tough for a lot of operators to run the business profitably. Now, Geico is profitable right now, but they're running far behind Progressive, and we kind of want some explanation about that, how the business is doing since Todd Combs came on board, and whether or not telematics, which they've apparently adopted, is making any meaningful impact on underwriting. Same sort of issue at Burlington Northern. They have one tough near-competitor in Union Pacific, and they've opted out of adopting precision scheduled railroading, which everybody else has adopted. And it's really put them behind the eight ball from a profitability perspective. The margin gap between them and Union Pacific has gone from about 300 basis points to 700 the last five years. So it's a troubling thing for us. And we'd like more answers about what they're doing, why this gap has gotten this wide, and whether or not they're going to adopt the scheduling strategy overall.
 
And then when we look at capital allocation, it is always, 'Where's cash? How much is it building up? What kind of share repurchase activity are you doing? Where do you have expectations about capital over the long run?' So a lot of good areas for us to focus on overall. Every year we actually put out a piece looking at 10 questions we would ask if we were at the meeting this year. And that piece should be coming out this week.

: All right. This week, the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history happened, and we were watching it, Charlie Munger was watching this unfold. First Republic Bank collapsed. JP Morgan Chase bought it. And Charlie Munger, he issued a warning about commercial property loans in a 
Financial Times
 article. What are your thoughts about his comments?
 
Warren
: Yeah, I mean, he's onto something in some sense, and again, this is not a Berkshire-related issue. They're not going to have any problems. They don't really have a whole lot of situations where they fronted money for commercial property development or anything like that. I think this is more than just a bank problem. I look at it as a bank problem, a debt market problem, but also a private capital problem. If we look back over the past 10 years, money's been relatively easy. Interest rates were near zero, and there was a lot of money flooding into private capital funds as well. A lot of deals were done on the real estate side with the expectation being that rates were going to be lower longer. And if we look at one subset of that commercial market, which is office properties, you know as well as I do not everybody's back in the office, a lot of office leases have been terminated, so rents are falling below where debt payments are now or where they're expected to be over time.
 
And if we look back just over the past year, we've seen situations where the investors have basically defaulted on their debt because either A) they couldn't get the debtholders to renegotiate terms, [B] they were running variable-rate debt, which escalated significantly last year with rates going up 500 basis points, or [C] they just weren't collecting enough in rent to really cover what was there.
 
So we're likely to see more of that activity as we move forward, but I think that's still a problem that's going to be spread out a little bit more. I mean, the banks are probably about as in good a shape as they ever have been. The financial crisis really taught a lot of lessons and really sort of minimized the amount of risk they were willing to take. And if you look back at that decade period we just came through, for loans that weren't being made by the banks, it was private capital that was stepping in and picking up the slack. So when I say that pain's going to be felt across the board, it's a little bit of everybody getting it there.
 
And I was actually just talking to our bank analyst about this, too. Most of the commercial real estate loans is really centered in a lot of the smaller banks. And then when we look at the banks that did fail here, honestly, these were not lending problems. Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic, all of them failed because they mismanaged their deposit base relative to their investment book. So they had a lot of long-dated maturity holdings in their investment book, and when the depositors started asking for their money back, they kept taking huge losses in order to meet those needs. It was more of a mismanagement problem on their part as opposed to poor lending decisions.
 
Banking Crisis Help From Buffett, Munger?

43,10 Questions to Ask at Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 Annual Meeting,Greggory Warren,2023-05-04 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1154906/10-questions-to-ask-at-berkshire-hathaways-2023-annual-meeting,morningstar.com,Here's what we'd like to hear Warren Buffett and his team discuss this year.,"As Berkshire Hathaway's 
BRK.A
/
BRK.B
 annual meeting draws near, we have compiled some insurance-related questions focused on Geico's competitive positioning as well as price hardening in the property-casualty and reinsurance markets. We've also put together questions on BNSF's reluctance to adopt precision scheduled railroading, Berkshire Hathaway Energy's push to scuttle its coal and natural gas generation capacity by 2050, bolt-on deal potential for Berkshire's manufacturing, service, and retailing segment, and other cash management priorities—especially as they relate to ongoing capital allocation and distributions to shareholders.
 
1. Why has Geico's performance been so poor recently relative to Progressive's?
 
During 2018-22, Geico generated average annual earned premium growth of 5.1%, despite generating negative 1.3% earned premium growth in 2020. However, its loss ratio went from 75.9% in 2012 to as high as 93.1% during 2022, averaging 81.9% the past five calendar years. Geico has tended to use a blunt-force approach to its underwriting, pursuing growth more aggressively than peers and at times showing a willingness to absorb higher loss ratios as it maximized its expense ratio edge (around 800 basis points below the industry average). Geico's loss ratio was abnormally high not only last year (owing to cost inflation and supply shortages in the U.S. automotive market) but during 2016-17, when the company was aggressively underwriting while many of its peers pulled back from the market in response to escalating claim severities and losses. Geico's expense ratio also took a hit during 2020-21 as it dealt with depressed earned premium growth as a result of policy rebates/credits and cancellations tied to the pandemic. This lowered the company's combined ratio to 96.0% on average during 2018-22, more on par with Allstate and Travelers than with Progressive. On top of that, Geico has seen its market share (based on premiums written) stagnate at around 13.8% on average during 2018-22.
 
Progressive, Geico's closest competitor in the direct-selling channel, generated earned premium growth of 13.4% on average the past five years in its direct-to-consumer private auto insurance arm and produced a combined ratio of 92.9% on average. Its overall private auto insurance business (which includes its agency operations) generated earned premium growth of 11.6%, with a combined ratio of 91.8% on average, during 2018-22. And Progressive has seen its market share expand from 11.0% in 2018 to 14.1% last year.
 
Why have the operating metrics between Geico and Progressive diverged so much of late, when both are focused more heavily on direct-to-consumer sales and had for many years been fairly comparable on a growth and profitability basis? Does it concern you that Geico's share has stagnated in a period when Progressive has been picking up ground, closing 2022 as the second-largest personal auto insurance underwriter in the United States? After all, Berkshire proudly touted Geico's status as the second-largest auto insurer when it passed Allstate in 2013.
 
2. Where are we with Geico's telematics offering?
 
The general view is that usage-based insurance technologies like Progressive's Snapshot program can provide more accurate assessments of the risks of individual policyholders, allowing insurers to better segment and price their risks by offering discounts to the safest drivers and charging those perceived to be riskier a more appropriate premium. With Ajit Jain's long record of assessing and pricing risk on the reinsurance side and Todd Combs having taken over supervision of Geico's day-to-day operations, we are curious about their views on why the auto insurer has been so slow to implement telematics, given that more data and information can only enhance the underwriting process, leading to more profitable growth in the long run.
 
How to Invest Like Warren Buffett
 
We understand that Geico's DriveEasy program is available in 33 states plus the District of Columbia, but recent underwriting results aren't what we would expect with telematics in the mix. Is this because the elevated level of claims severities is overcoming the benefit from telematics? Or is the telematics program is not implemented fully enough to produce a meaningful improvement in underwriting results? If it is the latter, how much longer do you think Geico will lag peers? Doesn't it risk an adverse selection problem longer-term if its telematics offering continues to trail peers'?
 
3. Has BNSF put itself behind the eight ball by not adopting precision scheduled railroading?
 
While BNSF has bested Union Pacific on volume and top-line growth during the past decade, it has trailed its main peer on a profitability basis. BNSF's operating ratio has been 430 basis points worse than Union Pacific's on average the past 5-10 years, as well as 250 basis points poorer than the average of all of the other Class I railroads, including Kansas City Southern.
 
With all of BNSF's peers having adopted precision scheduled railroading in one form or another, the expectation is that this outperformance in profitability could approach 650 basis points for Union Pacific and 530 basis points on average for all of the other Class I railroads (excluding Kansas City Southern, which was recently acquired by Canadian Pacific). This leads to the potential for Union Pacific and others to get more competitive on pricing, giving up some margin in order to drive share gains.
 
For more than five years, BNSF and Berkshire have said the railroad is in wait-and-see mode when it comes to PSR. With the gap in profitability widening, where is BNSF with PSR? What are the opportunities and drawbacks you see in the strategy? We know that the industry has gone into quiet mode on PSR following the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment and subsequent hazardous chemical spill and fire, not wanting to rankle the regulators who see PSR as being partly responsible for a decrease in rail safety the past several years. However, the strategy is still up and running at all of BNSF's peers.
 
4. How can BHE retire all of its natural gas units by 2050 and still provide reliable power to consumers?
 
Berkshire Hathaway Energy's 2022 corporate brochure noted that your 'businesses are striving to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in a manner our customers can afford, our regulators will allow, and technology advances support,' with plans to retire BHE's remaining 14 coal units by 2049 and all natural gas units by 2050. How does BHE plan to close all of its natural gas units by 2050 and still provide reliable power to its consumers? With coal and natural gas off the table, BHE would have to rely more heavily on wind and solar power generation, which can be more intermittent in nature.
 
If we look at MidAmerican—which we assume is the operating model for BHE's other utilities longer-term—natural gas accounted for just 3% of power generation owned and purchased in both 2005 and 2022, with all of the unit's coal plant retirements the past 20 years covered primarily by the buildout of wind power. This led us to assume that the 3% natural gas generation capacity maintained by MidAmerican was the baseline required to serve as a backstop for its renewable energy generation capacity in its core retail electric markets.
 
5. What would it take for utilities consolidation to pick up again in North America?
 
In Berkshire's 2020 annual letter to shareholders, you wrote that Berkshire Hathaway Energy 'pays no dividends on its common stock, a highly unusual practice in the electric utilities industry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country's electric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all of BHE's earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will be appropriately rewarded.'
 
BHE has benefited from being part of Berkshire's larger consolidated tax return, as well as from not having to pay a dividend up to the parent company (most publicly traded peers pay out as much as 60% of earnings as dividends annually). This has allowed the subsidiary to invest far more capital in renewables than it would have been able to on a stand-alone basis.
 
Given that a lot of other North American utilities don't have the same level of financial flexibility as BHE does, let alone access to the amount of capital that Berkshire can bring to bear on the part of its subsidiaries, we wonder when we'll start to see more consolidation in the utilities market in order to effect the massive makeover of our country's electric utilities that needs to take place.
 
Is it a matter of valuation, or are there some other structural impediments that keep us from seeing the level of consolidation that needs to take place in North America? What would it take, in your view, for consolidation to pick up again? Do you agree with the belief of many industry participants that Berkshire will be one of five main consolidators of North American utilities over the next couple of decades?
 
6. Is there anything structural or behavioral keeping Berkshire's managers from pursuing acquisitions?
 
One of the perceived advantages of being acquired by Berkshire is that operating under the conglomerate's umbrella provides the management teams of the acquired companies with access to a ton of capital at what we assume are favorable rates. However, we've not seen a lot of outright or bolt-on acquisition activity from Berkshire's subsidiaries over the past 10 years, with the average annual outlay for acquisitions being $2.6 billion and the average quarterly outlay being around $650 million on average during 2013-22. In the past five years, Berkshire has spent even less, with the average annual outlay for acquisitions being $2.2 billion (around $540 million on average quarterly). This for a company that generated $24.0 billion in free cash flow annually on average during 2018-22.
 
In the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment, there was some expectation that the 2016 purchase of Precision Castparts (which had previously been a serial acquirer), as well as the 2015 purchase of Van Tuyl Group (which operates in a U.S. auto dealership market that has been ripe for consolidation for some time), would lead to more deals over time. With Berkshire sitting on so much excess cash—the average amount of dry powder on hand the past five years has been around $97 billion quarterly—it has been surprising to see so few deals being done. Granted, valuations have been less than desirable for many of the types of quality companies that Berkshire prefers to buy, but we expected more activity than what we've seen the past 5-10 years.
 
Is there anything structural or behavioral that is keeping Berkshire's managers (who aren't named Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Greg Abel, or Ajit Jain) from pursuing acquisitions? Is there any hesitance to ask corporate for capital when they want to pursue a deal? Do you wish that they were doing more to pursue more bolt-on acquisitions? Do you think this may change now that Alleghany Capital is on board, given its penchant for pursuing deals more aggressively than perhaps Berkshire has done in the past?
 
7. How much cash and cash equivalents should we consider as being held in reserve?
 
While Berkshire's large equity investment portfolio and bond holdings have generally been far greater than the company's required insurance loss reserves, you have said that you'd like to keep around $30 billion in cash on hand as a backstop for the insurance operations. This is up from the $20 billion figure that you had highlighted for many years before the COVID-19 outbreak. Given that the size of Berkshire's insurance operations continues to expand, should we expect that cash reserve balance to continue to go up over time?
 
If we look at just cash and cash equivalents held by the insurance segment at the end of each quarter over the past five years, the average balance has been around $71 billion, with a low of $57 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and a high of $91 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. All of this was well above the revised threshold of $30 billion that you have laid out for required cash reserves.
 
Also, while Berkshire's total investment portfolio (excluding Kraft Heinz) covered loss reserves by 2.0 times at the end of last year, most of that coverage was coming from the equity portfolio, which covered loss reserves by 1.7 times at the end of 2022.
 
Have the insurance regulators ever discussed how much cash and cash equivalents they'd like to see Berkshire hold on its balance sheet, given the ever-expanding size of its equity investment portfolio?
 
By our calculations, cash holdings in the insurance operations have averaged 19% of loss reserves the past decade but dropped to 17% at the end of 2022 after the Alleghany deal. Raising the required cash reserves to $35 billion would bring things more in line with historical levels, while a jump to $40 billion would lift cash reserves to 22% of 2022 loss reserves but would likely eliminate the need for Berkshire to raise the level again in the near to medium term.
 
8. Do you regret setting a $150 billion threshold for the cash on Berkshire's balance sheet?
 
At the May 2017 meeting, you told shareholders, 'There's no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash or more and we think we're doing something brilliant by doing it.' During 2018-22, Berkshire held cash balances in excess of $125 billion 11 times, in excess of $135 billion four times, and in excess of $145 billion three times. With the company generating $6 billion in free cash flow quarterly on average during that time, it was only ever a few quarters away from hitting the $150 billion threshold, unless Berkshire put capital to work in investments, acquisitions, and share repurchases.
 
As long as valuations are still inadequate for the publicly traded and privately held companies Berkshire prefers to acquire or invest in, making acquisitions and stock investments all that much harder to enact, the company seems to be stuck with share repurchases as the primary option for working down cash balances (especially with dividends off the table). This was exemplified by the commitment to an average of $6.2 billion in quarterly share repurchases during 2020, $6.8 billion in quarterly share repurchases during",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Greggory Warren",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/SVBVP2K6MBBSVN3GHEJSZPCPUQ.jpg,False,@MorningstarInc,19.285324,2bebc957ef3671969e0b9b08a50a630b

Berkshire Hathaway Earnings Update
 
With wide-moat Berkshire Hathaway reporting first-quarter results that were about in line with our expectations, we are leaving our $555,000 ($370) per Class A (B) share fair value estimate in place.
 
First-quarter reported revenue, which includes unrealized and realized gains/losses from Berkshire's investments and derivatives portfolios, increased 74.5% year over year to $120.2 billion. Excluding the impact of investment and derivative gains/losses and other adjustments, first-quarter operating revenue increased 20.5% to $85.4 billion (with most of that gain coming from the Alleghany acquisition and the onboarding of operating results from Pilot Travel Centers after Berkshire raised its stake in the firm to 80% at the end of January 2023).
 
Operating earnings, exclusive of the impact of investment and derivative gains/losses, increased 12.6% year over year to $8.1 billion during the March quarter.
 
While most of the company's segments posted solid operating earnings growth (with insurance getting a boost from the Alleghany deal), the railroad and manufacturing, service, and retailing units posted modest declines year over year. When including the impact of the investment and derivative gains/losses, reported operating earnings increased 536.3% to $35.5 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year's period.
 
Book value per share, which still serves as a decent proxy for measuring changes in Berkshire's intrinsic value, increased 8.0% sequentially to $350,405 (from $324,322 at the end of December 2022), slightly above our forecast of $344,773. The company closed out the March quarter with $130.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up slightly from $128.6 billion at the end of last year (with Berkshire using $4.4 billion for share repurchases, $3.7 billion for capital expenditures, $7.6 billion for acquisitions, and $2.9 billion for stock investments during the quarter). Berkshire, by our estimates, had $89.8 billion in dry powder at the start of the second quarter.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Greggory Warren",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/MGU6T5CWRVBYJMAAWKYFECJI5Q.jpeg,False,@MorningstarInc,17.702574,5be073aaa6253a2f2718b0eb6b894f50
45,Berkshire Hathaway: 5 Main Takeaways From the 2023 Annual Meeting,Greggory Warren,2023-05-08 00:00:00,date,https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1155752/berkshire-hathaway-5-main-takeaways-from-the-2023-annual-meeting,morningstar.com,Here's what you need to know.,"While wide-moat Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting has always been entertaining, it has generally not been a huge source of meaningful insight into the firm's operations. This year's event had the feel of past meetings, with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger joined by Ajit Jain and Greg Abel on stage taking questions from CNBC's Becky Quick and shareholders during a live event in Omaha.
 
The nature of the questions coming from shareholders this year seemed to be driven more toward eliciting information about the inner workings and performance of Berkshire's operating companies and investments and succession planning, although they were interspersed with plenty of questions about the economy, the health of the U.S. banking system, and requests for advice from Buffett and Munger about one thing or another in the questioner's life or business.
 
That said, we still think the elimination of the analyst panel and two of the three journalists has reduced the focus on the inner workings of Berkshire's businesses and management's capital allocation decisions. We also believe that one of the biggest drawbacks of the annual meeting format is that it generally prohibits follow-up questions, which might directly challenge statements coming from management during the course of the question-and-answer segment.
 
If we had to sum up our main takeaways from this year's meeting—that is, from an analyst's perspective—we would highlight the following: the meeting provided more insight into Geico's woes; BNSF's game plan remains a mystery; Berkshire is comfortable with the risks associated with some of its largest holdings (including Apple, Bank of America, and Occidental Petroleum); the company continues to expect to invest heavily in renewables; Abel, who is Buffett's heir apparent, is invested more in Berkshire and keenly involved in business planning and capital allocation decisions.",morningstar.com,2140,news,US,en,"CFA,Greggory Warren",https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/SVBVP2K6MBBSVN3GHEJSZPCPUQ.jpg,False,@MorningstarInc,18.443594,d4bdb1ed6f1aaa499f2b5c22218a2910

NEW YORK: Warren Buffett faced question after question about one thing in particular at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual meeting on Saturday: his successor.
 
Buffett named Greg Abel as heir apparent in 2021, and the vice-chairman for non-insurance operations has had a more pronounced presence ever since.
 
On Saturday, Buffett reaffirmed he was '100% comfortable' with the decision and even indicated a largely business-as-usual transition, whenever that could be.
 
'Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do. That's lucky for us,' Buffett said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. 'He will make those decisions, I think, very much in the same framework as I would make them. We have laid out that framework now for 30 years.'
 
Abel, 60, who joined Buffett and his long-term business partner Charlie Munger on stage for the morning, has built Berkshire's energy business into one of the largest in the US. Buffett recently joked that Abel does 'all the work'.
 
Buffett faulted the executives in charge of the failed US banks, arguing they should be held accountable for mistakes that were hiding in 'plain sight.'
 
He also called out 'messed up' incentives in banking regulation as well as poor messaging by regulators, politicians and the press to the American public about the upheaval.
 
Buffett pointed to the First Republic Bank filings that he said showed the lender was offering jumbo, non-government-backed mortgages at fixed rates that were interest-only for 10 years in some cases, which Buffett called 'a crazy proposition'.
 
As lawmakers race to resolve a standoff around the US debt ceiling, Buffett said he couldn't see how Washington would allow the US to default on its debt, an outcome that would tip the financial system into turmoil. — Bloomberg",thestar.com.my,1823,finance,MY,en,,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2023/05/09/2062750.jpg,False,,10.8749485,cda6c1b5a3377ace02928e31bc768795

RNAimmune
, a biotech company focused on developing groundbreaking mRNA therapies, recently received FDA approval to begin Phase 1 clinical studies for an investigational new drug (IND). The drug product was supplied by Berkshire Sterile Manufacturing, using their new low-loss fill process. The process was key to overcoming product sensitivity challenges and reducing drug product loss to supply product for clinical studies in time.
 
BSM's 
low loss fill process
 was designed and validated in 2022 to limit drug product loss for high-value medicines, and it features several additional advantages, including low shear, high repeatability, and excellent precision.
 
RNAimmune contracted BSM to fill an oligonucleotide therapy encompassed in a proprietary lipid nano particle (LNP). The product is exceptionally shear-sensitive and demonstrated degradation from shear forces in both peristaltic and piston pumps.
 
Unlike a standard sterile fill finish project, the low loss fill process does not use a pump in filling. Instead, sterile drug product is filled utilizing a low-shear, time-pressure filling system. The process is entirely isolator-based and offers less than 30mL of drug product loss (including losses from formulation, filtration, and filling). In addition to excellent repeatability and accuracy, the process requires significantly less operator interaction than traditional hand-pipetting.
 
BSM also developed a formulation and sterile filtration process to further reduce shear. During formulation, BSM enveloped RNAimmune's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in their proprietary LNP and optimized the removal of the organic solvent and the sterile filtration process to reduce shear.
 
'We are excited to see the positive impact that our low loss fill process has for RNAimmune's product,' said Shawn Kinney, CEO of Berkshire Sterile Manufacturing. 'Our goal is to provide innovative solutions to ensure our clients receive the highest quality drug products with the greatest product yield possible. The BSM team welcomed the challenge and delivered what the customer wanted.'
 
""We are happy about the collaboration with the Berkshire Sterile Manufacturing team. The IND clearance from the FDA will allow us to investigate RV-1730 as an effective vaccine booster with the potential to provide continued protection against COVID-19,"" said Dong Shen, MD, PhD, founder and President of RNAimmune. ""This study is expected to provide preliminary data on the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of RV-1730's technology when using a vaccine construct that targets the SARS-CoV-2 variants.'
 
Berkshire Sterile Manufacturing has filled two successful GMP lots for RNAimmune, and the CDMO expects to further improve their capabilities for oligonucleotides, LNP projects, and small-scale, low-volume drug product filling.

49,Tibet House US to Present Cynthia Berkshire's VEIL: TWO SISTERS in July,Blair Ingenthron,2023-06-10 00:00:00,date,https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Tibet-House-US-to-Present-Cynthia-Berkshires-VEIL-TWO-SISTERS-in-July-20230610,broadwayworld.com,"Tibet House US will present the original multimedia performance work VEIL: Two Sisters, created by NYC choreographer Cynthia Berkshire, July 14 & 15, 8:30 pm, at Tibet House, 22 West 15th Street, NYC.","Tibet House US will present the original multimedia performance work VEIL: Two Sisters, created by NYC choreographer Cynthia Berkshire, July 14 & 15, 8:30 pm, at Tibet House, 22 West 15th Street, NYC. Berkshire reveals two sisters lured into a link between the earthly and heavenly realms. A poignant vision of our emotional and psychic lives, VEIL is inspired in part by the Celtic notion of ""thin places"", where heaven and earth meet, considering this meeting as a connection to oneself and to another. The July program will feature a projected video of the performance and incorporate live performers, with an ending ritual leaving a path of light on which the audience will be invited to walk.

Cynthia Berkshire's work is distinctive and original. Blending realistic and abstract gesture and phrasing, VEIL progresses with both a sense of unraveling and holding back. Refined simplicity expands into motion and emotion as circles, white flowing fabric, falling marigolds, and celestial stars accompany the reunion of two sisters. Weaving repetition, mirroring and support from a mysterious chorus of spirits, VEIL: Two Sisters explores the thin veil of relation on multiple levels, considering the ways the process of forgiveness can take place between these sisters and others.

The concept of VEIL was inspired, in part, by Cynthia's bond to a sister who passed before they met, along with her travels to India and the death of her father during the project's development. As the younger sister calls to her older sister, who has passed, a chorus of three women offer guidance. Within a striking video environment, the sisters' fervent dream of connection becomes an enchanting poem.

A Forgiveness Workshop based on VEIL will be held Saturday, July 15, 4 to 6 pm, at Tibet House. Fee: $25. The creative movement workshop will explore the theme of forgiveness through simple and playful exercises, including a warmup, improvisation, learned and group movement. For more information on the Workshop, please visit the Tibet House website. (https://events.thus.org/programs/forgiveness-workshop-based-performance-project-veil-two-sisters/)

As the dialogue confirms, the world of science can be a rather lonely place. The ensemble cast is professional, polished, and well balanced.","PHOTOGRAPH 51, at Berkshire Theatre Group's Unicorn Theatre in Stockbridge presents a balance of the historical, romantic and scientific, PHOTOGRAPH 51 is about ambition, isolation and the race for greatness.

The portrait of British scientist Rosalind Franklin and her often overlooked role in the discovery of DNA's double helix structure is set in the 1950s, the age of scientific discovery, researchers are scrambling to be the first to unlock the mysteries of DNA. Among these scientists is Franklin, an underappreciated genius working as the sole woman in her field of study. When one of her photographs shows the structural outline of DNA for the first time, her competitors James Watson and Francis Crick are rapt with attention. Watson and Crick's ambition to become the first to create a working model of DNA, coupled with Franklin's stubbornness, leads the two men to gain notoriety as the first to complete and discover the DNA model and leave Franklin out of the history books.

Much of the play's early action establishes Rosalind (Rebecca Brooksher) as a strong, highly qualified woman in a world virtually exclusive to men, long before the feminist movement began to chip away at the glass ceiling. A world in which men enjoy privilege without question and the very notion of equality between genders does not exist. Rosalind is undermined by her colleague, Maurice Wilkins (David Adkins) who repeatedly takes credit for her efforts. He allows Rosalind and her work to barely exist in the background, leaving her to be seen only as a nameless ""photographer"" rather than a prominent scientist responsible for groundbreaking work. She also struggles to compete with the rival scientific team of James Watson (Allen Tedder) and Francis Crick (Christian Coulson) in a race to unlock the mystery of the DNA molecule.

Under the direction of David Auburn, Franklin is presented as a stoic character seemingly devoid of personality. She appears relatively dry, plain, and direct telling a colleague: ""I do not joke. I take my work seriously"". When Rosalind's colleague, Ray Gosling (Brandon Dial) admits his fear at the risk and potential danger of their work, she remains strong and incredibly dedicated to the task at hand. We learn, however, that there is depth below the surface. Rosalind's tough no nonsense e exterior is in response to a world ruled by perception rather than reality. Where societal norms and expectations dominate, and in which she must be exponentially better than her male counterparts, only to be seen as having a fraction of their worth and value. Writer, Anna Ziegler, drives the point of reality being far different from perception and assumption by painting the men in the piece to be largely driven by gossip and conjecture rather than factual evidence as one might expect from men of science. In this production, the potential romance between Rosalind and Don Caspar (Shaun Anthony), a graduate student whom she helps and becomes a colleague, offers a welcome glimpse at humanity, emotion, and interpersonal dynamics that I particularly enjoyed.

With a run time of approximately 105 minutes (with no intermission) PHOTOGRAPH 51 is a biographical piece of theater that plays out in scientific laboratories in mid twentieth century England. The pressure of competition over collaboration is pervasive. There is no getting around the dryness. There are little to no moments of levity or comic relief. The subject matter, like Rosalind, does not allow for jokes. As the dialogue confirms, the world of science can be a rather lonely place. The ensemble cast is professional, polished, and well balanced. The artistic team includes Scenic Designer Bill Clarke; Costume Designer Elvia Bovenzi Blitz; Lighting and Projections Designer, Daniel J. Kotlowitz whose collective efforts do a rather simple, but effective job, and help in achieving an overall high-quality production.

Key Points,"Key Points



Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired an additional 2.1 million shares of Occidental Petroleum, boosting its ownership to over 25%.

Analysts predict a 20.12% upside for OXY, with a consensus price target of $70.29.

Occidental presents a compelling investment opportunity with an appealing valuation, strong management, and potential growth in the oil and gas sector. 5 stocks we like better than brk-a

warren buffett 's berkshire hathaway (nyse:brk.a) (nyse:brk.b) disclosed in a filing late Wednesday that it purchased an additional 2,138,250 shares of occidental petroleum (nyse:oxy) . Buffett's Berkshire acquired the additional shares between June 26 and June 28 for about $122.1 million. Berkshire's total ownership now stands at 224.1 million shares. The most recent purchase boosts Berkshire's stake in Occidental to more than 25% of outstanding shares.

Buffett's involvement with OXY began almost three years ago when Berkshire funded Occidental's takeover of Anadarko with $10 billion in equity. Buffett's company then began acquiring a stake in the oil company last year around the time when Russia invaded Ukraine, and the price of oil was rising.

At Berkshire's annual meeting on may 6 , Buffett was full of praise for the oil company and its management. Notably, Buffett said that Berkshire had no plans to take control of the company. He said,'We're not going to buy control,' and added,'We've got the right management running it.'

After boosting its ownership stake from 23.7% to 25.1% in OXY, Buffett's Berkshire further cements its spot as the largest shareholder of OXY, with State Street Corp's 5.2% in second place. Over the last 12 months, the net institutional inflow has been negative $1.16 billion, with total inflows of $3.98 billion and $5.14 billion in outflows. Current institutional ownership in OXY is 78.3%.

Analysts covering Occidental have a consensus price target of $70.29, predicting a 20.12% upside in the oil name. Based on 21 analysts' ratings , the stock currently has a Hold rating. Eight analysts rate the stock a Buy, ten a Hold, two a Sell, and one a Strong Buy. Most recently, Stephens initiated coverage of OXY with a price target of $72 and an Overweight rating.

Since Buffett first began buying Occidental shares in early March 2022, the stock has risen over 53%. During that same period, the spdr s&p 500 etf trust (nymarket:spy) has risen close to 1.25%. However, YTD shares of OXY are down 6.49%, while the SPY is up 14.56%. Of course, Buffett won't be concerned with a six-month comparative performance; instead, as fits with his philosophy, he will focus on a longer time frame.

Of course, investors shouldn't simply follow Buffett's Berkshire and invest in OXY but instead conduct their own due diligence and research. However, when looking at the oil company's prospects, it presents a compelling opportunity.

Firstly, Buffett's solid assessment of the company's management team, specifically in the leadership positions of OXY, is a crucial factor to keep in mind for investors. Occidental's valuation is also appealing, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 12.09.

The demand for oil and gas is expected to rise in the upcoming years. This presents a significant opportunity for Occidental, particularly considering its substantial carbon capture and sequestration investments. Notably, the company focuses on direct air capture facilities, which extract carbon from the atmosphere.

Buffett's continued interest in Occidental is a positive factor, as he perceives the stock favorably and continues to add to Berkshire's already significant position.

These companies are members of Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (GUARD) and are domiciled in Wilkes-Barre, PA, unless otherwise specified. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.

The ratings reflect GUARD's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management, with lift from parental support.

GUARD continued to benefit from rate increases in most of its lines of business, while moderating gross and net premium growth and reducing loss ratios in most of its key lines. During this period, GUARD has consistently maintained a solid risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by the Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), at the 99.6% VaR. While GUARD's operating earnings had declined in the past few years, the company has intensified its efforts to map losses and improve profitability, showing positive results through improved underwriting in the past year. On the investment side, GUARD recorded significant unrealized capital losses as the stock market performance was negative last year, which impacted the company's common stock portfolio. These losses were recovered partially in the first quarter of 2023. AM Best continues to see GUARD's operating performance as well-placed in the adequate assessment on an absolute basis and relative to the commercial casualty segment.

Additionally, the ratings further recognize the implicit and explicit financial support provided by GUARD's immediate parent, National Indemnity Company (NICO), including significant capital support via reinsurance transactions. NICO is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire) [NYSE: BRK A and BRK B].

While GUARD's workers' compensation business continues to produce long-term favorable return ratios, the group's fast-growing business lines have shown less favorable performance. However, GUARD has been deliberate and measured in its approach to the market, as the company continues to improve its exposure-mapping processes and controls to prevent losses. Despite these concerns, the stable outlooks reflect GUARD's enhanced financial flexibility provided by Berkshire, solid balance sheet and long-term underwriting profitability. GUARD's investment portfolio, which is managed by Berkshire, has contributed significantly to surplus growth through unrealized capital gains and accounted for more than half of surplus growth in the past five years.

The ratings could come under pressure if underwriting results and overall operating performance decreases to a level incompatible with an adequate assessment. The ratings also could experience negative pressure should Berkshire cease to provide sufficient financial and operational support. In addition, a significant reduction in surplus resulting from losses in GUARD's investment portfolio, which has a significant allocation to equity holdings, or from a material prior year unfavorable reserve development, which also could lead to negative rating pressure.

Henri Murger
's 1851 novel, Scènes de la vie de Bohème, which follows the lives of young people living in the Latin Quarter of Paris. The opera tells the story of Rodolfo and Mimì, two lovers who meet by chance and change each other's lives forever. Puccini's soaring, aching melodies perfectly capture the emotion of every moment, from the exhilaration of young love at first sight to the story's heartbreaking conclusion.Of BOF's new production, Stage Director and BOF Co-Founder Jonathon Loy says: 'This will be a production with a fresh take that will center on the epic love and loss of innocence that these characters face in one of the greatest and most widely-known operas in the canon."" BOF Artistic Director and Co-Founder Brian Garman adds: 'I am so proud to present La Bohème to our Berkshire audiences, featuring an absolutely top-notch cast that has received praise for their performances around the world. An ideal opera for first-time operagoers and seasoned opera veterans alike, this production is sure to capture your heart.'
Playing Rodolfo is tenor Yongzhao Yu, who makes his BOF debut. An expert La Bohème interpreter, he has sung the role of Rodolfo at opera houses across the country, including 
Houston Grand 
, Wolf Trap , and Arizona , and he covered the role for The Metropolitan . Opposite Yu is soprano Whitney Morrison, who also makes her BOF debut in the role of Mimì.

The French-American soprano has been praised for her 'expressive, lovingly shaded soprano' and ""dazzling coloratura and lithe stage presence [used] to piquant comedic effect"" ( News). The children's chorus for this production will be The Chidren's Chorus of Springfield, which offers high-quality musical experiences across languages, cultures, and eras. Of this production, Director Laurie Ellington says: ""The Children's Chorus of Springfield is looking forward with great anticipation to collaborating with BOF on their summer production of La Bohème. This will be the first collaboration of its kind for our organization and the children are beyond excited to perform in a large-scale opera, on a big stage, and in such a professional setting. There is so much to learn: singing classical music, singing in Italian, learning the staging, and meeting all the top-notch singers involved in BOF.  We think it will be the experience of a lifetime!""
In addition to the three mainstage performances, there will be a free preview event with BOF co-founders at the Berkshire Athenaeum, Pittsfield's Public Library on Saturday, July 29 presented in partnership with Rainbow Seniors; and a free pre-performance talk on Saturday, August 26, at the Colonial Theatre with dramaturg Cori Ellison at 12pm (11:45am doors), which is open to all ticket holders.

That helped offset declines at other businesses including the BNSF railroad, where lower shipments of consumer goods and increased price competition from the trucking industry contributed to a 24% drop in overall profit.

Investors closely watch Berkshire because of Buffett's reputation, and because results from the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's dozens of operating units often mirror broader economic trends.

Those units also include Berkshire's namesake energy company, several industrial companies, and familiar brands such as Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.

Operating profit rose 7% to $10.04 billion, or about $6,938 per Class A share, from $9.42 billion a year earlier.

Net income totaled $35.91 billion, or $24,775 per Class A share, compared with a year-earlier $43.62 billion loss.

Berkshire also said it had repurchased $1.4 billion of stock in the quarter.

It also remained a big net seller of stocks from its $353 billion equity portfolio - about half of which is Apple (AAPL.O) - shedding about $8 billion more stocks than it bought.

That helped push Berkshire's cash stake up to $147.4 billion as of June 30 from $130.6 billion three months earlier.

Net results included $25.9 billion of largely unrealized gains from investments and derivatives.

Those results are volatile because accounting rules require Berkshire to report unrealized gains even if it sells nothing. Buffett urges investors to ignore the fluctuations.

The quarter was the first to fully include results from truck stop operator Pilot, in which Berkshire now owns an 80% stake. Pilot contributed $114 million to operating profit.

Buffett turns 93 on August 30. He is worth $117.5 billion and the world's sixth-richest person, Forbes magazine said.

Berkshire Class A shares closed Friday at $533,600, about 2% below their record high.

Black Opry Revue
at The Colonial TheatreSaturday, November 4 at 7:30pm
Tickets: $30
Black Opry is a home for Black artists and Black fans of country, blues, folk and Americana music. Country music has been made by and loved by Black people since its conception. For just as long, Black artists have been overlooked and disregarded in the genre by fans and executives. Black Opry wants to change that and invites audiences to discover, support and enjoy the Black artists that make magic in this space. One of the most valuable aspects of country music is its versatility and diversity in sound. Country, blues, folk and Americana music often overlap or weave together; these artists explore all of those sounds and intersections. The Black Opry Revue showcases the diversity in sound and stories that Black artists offer to these genres.
The lineup includes Chris Walton, Jeiris Cook, Roberta Lea and Aisha Burns.

' New Immigrant Experience Concert
A Fundraiser for Berkshire Immigrant Center, The West Stockbridge Historical Society and Berkshire Theatre Groupat The Colonial TheatreSaturday, October 21 at 7:30pmTickets: $75
The New Immigrant Experience, the remarkable release by composer 
Felipe Salles
, is a powerful multimedia work inspired by the lives of 'Dreamers,' the almost 700,000 individuals currently protected by DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Written by Salles who emigrated from Brazil to the  in 1995 and developed with the aid of a 
John Simon
 Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship, the work uses speech cadences and melodic motifs based on key words as its main source of musical material. The compelling and personal stories this work tells were collected through interviews Salles conducted with a group of nine 'Dreamers' during the summer of 2018. It's an emotional musical journey through beautiful orchestral textures, carefully developed motifs and intense solo features, that combine the power of a big band recording and the dramatic landscape of a soundtrack. The New Immigrant Experience is the perfect vehicle to contribute to the discussion regarding the place and value of immigrants in America during these turbulent political times. The West Stockbridge Historical Society is partnering with the Berkshire Immigrant Center and the Berkshire Theatre Group to bring The New Immigrant Experience, performed by the full 18-piece ensemble, to Berkshire County. Proceeds from the event will also benefit each of the hosting organizations. This performance is more than a music concert that touches on one of the most politically fraught issues of our time; it is a chance to celebrate and shine a spotlight on the positive contributions that the Berkshire immigrant community makes to enhancing the quality of life in the county. There are over 10,000 immigrants living in Berkshire County. In countless and often unseen and undervalued ways, the Berkshire immigrant community makes a significant contribution to improving the quality of life for all of us. The money raised through concert ticket sales, sponsor donations, and local business ad sales, will provide the funding that ensures the local immigrant population can participate in the evening's festivities.

New Year's Eve with Max Creek 
at The Colonial TheatreSunday, December 31 from 8pm to 12:30am
Tickets: General Admission: $34 (advanced); $39 (day of show)
Join us this New Year's Eve at The Colonial Theatre for a very special performance by one of Berkshire County's Favorite Bands, Max Creek! Max Creek has reached its fifth decade of playing music in the Northeast. Creek's style lacks pretense; there is no genre title that can define them. From the beginning, they mixed rock, country, reggae, soul, jazz and calypso and combined it with their own great songwriting.  The band is joyous, and their stage is full of smiles and laughter, both during and between songs. Max Creek is engaging, sculpting lengthy shows on-the-fly from their 200+ song catalog with rockers, ballads, deep jams and crowd sing-alongs. Furthermore, Creek is, most definitely, a family. 40-odd years in, the audience is a multi-generational stew—it's not uncommon to witness old-school 'Creek Freeks' getting down with their teenage (or older!) kids.  
Creek itself is multigenerational. Guitarist Scott Murawski, keyboardist Mark Mercier and bassist John Rider have remained intact since the mid-'70s, and the current drums and percussion team consist of Bill Carbone and Jamemurrell Stanley, who weren't even born when Max Creek started.

Internet of things technology is widely being used by car rental and leasing companies to maintain and manage fleets. The Internet of things is a network of internet-connected objects or devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors. Using IoT technology, car leasing companies can access odometer and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) in real time which facilitates fleet maintenance. This technology is also being used by car rental companies to check fuel level information at the point of car return, eliminating the need for staff to check fuel levels manually.
 
Furthermore, virtual key solutions for locking and unlocking doors help avoid the management of a large number of physical keys. For example, car rental firm Hertz is implementing IoT technology to provide keyless car rental services and manage its fleet to reduce costs.
The emergence of startups as major clients of leasing service providers is expected to drive the market. Driven by cost efficiency and the necessity to acquire advanced equipment which is often high-priced, startups have started renting or leasing their equipment. The increasing number of startups is also expected to positively impact the market.
 
The global leasing market grew from $1519.9 billion in 2022 to $1674.39 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2%. The leasing market is expected to grow to $2424.62 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 9.7%.

The unwinding of stock in Hewlett-Packard, or HP as the company is commonly known, represents the first sale of stock in the maker of personal computers (PCs) and printers since Berkshire Hathaway bought a 12% stake in the company in 2022.

Berkshire Hathaway now has 115.5 million HP shares, worth about $3.3 billion U.S., according to statutory regulatory filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The stock sale had to be disclosed by law because Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 10% of HP stock. After the sale, Berkshire owns about 11% of HP.

It is not clear why Buffett reduced his position in HP stock or if he will continue unwinding his holding in the company. Buffett rarely discusses the reasons behind his stock trades.

However, Buffett likely took a loss on the sale of HP stock as the computer maker's share price has declined nearly 25% since Berkshire's final purchase of HP shares in April 2022.

Berkshire Hathaway's own stock has increased 32% over the last 12 months and is currently trading at $367.82 U.S., near its all-time high.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/14/B_75125image_story.jpg,False,@menafn,22.199059,ef18602d8774748b8b1a0345389adb02

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.32% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 31, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.32% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 31, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The stock of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B), the holding company of famed investor Warren Buffett, has received a rare downgrade.

Analysts at investment firm Edward Jones lowered their rating on Berkshire Hathaway's stock to'hold' from'buy,' citing the fact that the company has been running ahead of its peers in the financial services sector.

Berkshire Hathaway's stock is up 15% so far this year compared to a flat reading for the financial services sector.

Most U.S. bank stocks are in the red for the year after the failure this past spring of several regional lenders.

Edward Jones said that continued outperformance by Berkshire Hathaway in the current environment is unlikely.

Berkshire Hathaway also holds nearly $150 billion U.S. in cash, one of the largest cash piles among American companies, and the stock benefits from its'safe haven' status as investors trust Buffett and his investing acumen.

Edward Jones had previously upgraded Berkshire's stock to a'buy' rating a year ago. Since then, the stock's Class B shares have gained 33% to trade at $357.06 U.S. per share.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-09/29/B_a5b2eimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,21.964249,ec840933f4a43ec6ee8fba2957e7876c

Transcr,"Adipose tissue composition contributes greatly to the quality and nutritional value of meat. Transcriptomic and lipidomic techniques were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the differences in fat deposition in Ningxiang pigs, Berkshires and F1 offspring. Transcriptomic analysis identified 680, 592, and 380 DEGs in comparisons of Ningxiang pigs vs. Berkshires, Berkshires vs. F1 offspring, and Ningxiang pigs vs. F1 offspring. The lipidomic analysis screened 423, 252, and 50 SCLs in comparisons of Ningxiang pigs vs. Berkshires, Berkshires vs. F1 offspring, and Ningxiang pigs vs. F1 offspring. Lycine, serine, and the threonine metabolism pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways were significantly enriched in comparisons of Berkshires vs. Ningxiang pigs and Berkshires vs. F1 offspring. The DEGs (PHGDH, LOC110256000) and the SCLs (phosphatidylserines) may have a great impact on the glycine, serine, and the threonine metabolism pathway. Moreover, the DEGs (FASN, ACACA, CBR4, SCD, ELOV6, HACD2, CYP3A46, CYP2B22, GPX1, and GPX3) and the SCLs (palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and icosadienoic acid) play important roles in the fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism of fatty acids. Thus, the difference in fat deposition among Ningxiang pig, Berkshires, and F1 offspring may be caused by differences in the expression patterns of key genes in multiple enriched KEGG pathways. This research revealed multiple lipids that are potentially available biological indicators and screened key genes that are potential targets for molecular design breeding.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett , was trading lower on Monday, down about 2% as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern.

The drop likely stemmed from the release of the company's third-quarter earnings on Saturday (yes, Saturday), when it posted a net loss of $12.8 billion, or $5.88 per share.

However, if you look a little deeper into the numbers, the selloff may have been a knee-jerk reaction to what was actually a pretty good quarter. One business line in particular stood out for Berkshire Hathaway: insurance.

Berkshire Hathaway 's net loss stems from its over $350 billion investment portfolio, which sustained a nearly $24 billion net loss in the quarter and dragged down its overall net earnings. That reflects the overall performance of the market, as the S&P 500 was down 3.8% in the third quarter, while Buffett's largest holding, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up some 47% of the portfolio, dropped 11% in the quarter.

It is important to note that these are unrealized losses because these investments have yet to be sold. However, it does include about $560 million in after-tax realized gains on sales of investments.

It is also worth noting that the portfolio has returned some $30 billion through the first three quarters, so you have to look past the quarterly ups and downs to the long-term track record, which has been stellar. The portfolio has had an average annual return of about 22% since Buffett has been managing it.

Importantly, Berkshire Hathaway emphasized that investors should not put much stock in the portfolio losses for the most recent quarter.

'The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,' Berkshire's latest report states.

Do you know which under-the-radar stocks the top hedge funds and institutional investors are investing in right now? Click here to find out .

The more significant metric to focus on is operating earnings, which is income generated through its wholly owned businesses. Berkshire Hathaway posted a 40% year-over-year increase in operating earnings, which rose to about $10.8 billion in the quarter. That was based on a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue to $93 billion.

The firm's earnings got a huge boost from its insurance businesses, which includes GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Insurance group revenue was up 19% to $24.3 billion, while net earnings were $5.9 billion, up from just $387 million a year ago in this same quarter.

GEICO recorded $1.1 billion in net earnings, up from a net loss of $759 million a year ago, while BH Reinsurance Group had earnings of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up from a net loss of $251 million in the third quarter of 2022.

GEICO earnings climbed on a 13% decrease in underwriting expenses, and its expense ratio - underwriting expense to premiums earned - was down 1.4 percentage points to 9.3% in the third quarter. For the first nine months, the expense ratio was down 2.1 percentage points to 9.7%, stemming from a 54% reduction in advertising expenses incurred. That may seem hard to believe, given how often those commercials seem to be on, but it's true.

For the Reinsurance group, earned premiums surged more than 42% in the quarter to $5.7 billion, offset somewhat by higher losses and underwriting expenses. Some of the other businesses were either flat or down, but the great thing about Berkshire Hathaway is that its wide array of assets and holdings allows it to perform well in various market environments.

Thus, when you look at those numbers, the quarter looks much better. Overall, Berkshire Hathaway stock is up by about 12% year to date, and this solid earnings report confirms it as a stock to strongly consider.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B), the holding company of famed investor Warren Buffett, has announced that its third-quarter operating profit rose 40% from a year earlier to reach a record $10.8 billion U.S.

The Omaha-based company, which owns a myriad of businesses ranging from the Dairy Queen restaurant chain to Geico insurance and BNSF railroad, reported that its operating profit totaled $10.761 billion U.S. in Q3, a 40.6% increase from $7.651 billion U.S. a year ago.

Berkshire also posted a record amount of cash on hand at the end of the quarter, totaling $157.2 billion U.S. The previous record cash holding was $149.2 billion U.S. set in 2021.

Cash now accounts for 20% of Berkshire's market capitalization. The company is benefiting from higher short rates with its cash position now earning more than 5% interest.

The record results come as Buffett has been taking advantage of surging bond yields, buying up short-term Treasury bills yielding at least 5% or greater over the past few months.

Berkshire Hathaway held $126.4 billion U.S. worth of U.S. Treasuries as of Sept. 30 this year, up from $93 billion U.S. at the end of 2022.

Geico, Berkshire's top performing insurance company, reported another profitable quarter with $1.1 billion U.S. of earnings.

However, railroad BNSF posted a 15% decline in earnings as it struggled with lower volumes and higher costs during the third quarter.

As for its massive investment portfolio that is worth $345 billion U.S., Berkshire Hathaway posted a significant loss of $24.1 billion U.S. as stocks declined between July and September.

Much of the investment loss stemmed from Berkshire's big stake in Apple, which comprises nearly half of its portfolio. Apple's share price fell 11.7% during the quarter.

Berkshire reduced its stake in oil major Chevron (CVX) by about 10% to 110 million shares worth $18.6 billion U.S. in Q3. Berkshire's stake in Apple was unchanged at 915 million shares worth $156.8 billion U.S.

Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of about $23 billion U.S. worth of stocks in Q3. As usual, Buffett asked investors to look past the quarterly fluctuations in his investment portfolio, saying that short-term performance is meaningless.

Berkshire's repurchases of its own stock slowed during Q3 as its share price hit a record high. The company spent $1.1 billion U.S. to repurchase shares in the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $7 billion U.S.

A massive trove of tax information obtained by ProPublica, covering thousands of America's wealthiest individuals, revealed what's inside the billionaires' bag of tricks for minimising their personal tax bills - sometimes to nothing.

Buffett privately traded in stocks that Berkshire Hathaway was buying and selling.

'Buffett has long said such trading would be a conflict of interest, and Berkshire policies prohibit it. But confidential records show that, on at least three occasions, he sold millions of dollars of shares in stocks that Berkshire was trading,' the report mentioned.

Buffett, the legendary investor known as the Oracle of Omaha, repeatedly sang the praises of Wells Fargo in an interview with Fortune.

The bank, Buffett said,'has come closer' to an effective business model'than any other big bank by some margin.'

The interview was published on April 20, 2009.

Banks were still reeling from the financial crisis and stock markets were turbulent.

'It was Buffett who had proposed the idea that turned into the $250 billion federal bailout that had propped up America's banks (including Wells Fargo),' the probe revealed.

By April 24, Wells Fargo shares had jumped 13 per cent. That day, Buffett privately sold off $20 million worth of Wells Fargo shares in his personal account.

Over the years, Buffett has been unequivocal about one aspect of his personal portfolio: He has repeatedly said he steers clear of trading stocks that his company is trading.

'I can't be buying what Berkshire is buying,' he has said.

Doing so, he stated on another occasion, would pose a'conflict' of interest.

'But roughly two decades of Buffett's personal trades were included in a leak of IRS data obtained by ProPublica. Those records show that the nation's best known and most respected investor has sometimes said one thing in public and done another in private,' the rpeort mentioned.

On at least three occasions, Buffett has traded stocks in his personal account in the same quarter or the quarter before Berkshire bought or sold shares of the same companies, doing so before the conglomerate's moves were disclosed to the public.

These trades may violate Berkshire's ethics policies, authored by Buffett himself, which require'all actual and anticipated securities transactions of Berkshire' be publicly disclosed before Berkshire employees can trade the stocks personally, the investigation added.

Overall, Buffett's records show he reported at least $466 million in personal stock sales between 2000 and 2019.

In October 2012, Buffett made another noteworthy personal trade.

Over several days, he sold $35 million worth of Johnson & Johnson shares.

At that point, Berkshire had effectively revealed that it, too, had sold Johnson & Johnson shares.

'In another instance, in August 2009, Buffett appeared to move, in his personal portfolio, in the opposite direction of Berkshire's portfolio. He sold $25 million of Walmart stock in his personal account, even as Berkshire almost doubled its stake (which had previously held steady for 15 quarters) during the same quarter,' according to the report.

The remaining shares, he said, were valued at around USD 100 billion.'I feel good but fully realize I am playing in extra innings,' the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chief executive officer said in a Thanksgiving letter to shareholders.

In the third quarter, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) was widely watched by value investors.

The investment firm sold its entire stake in General Motors (GM). This is a wise move. Staff costs are soaring after the UAW accepted a wage increase of 20% for base hourly rates. Skilled trades get a 25% hike. Yet GM is stuck selling expensive trucks and SUVs at a time when consumers are shunning high-priced items.

Berkshire sold Activision (ATVI) after Microsoft (MSFT) closed its $95 buyout in Q3. It divested its small positions in J&J (JNJ), United Parcel Service (UPS), Proctor & Gamble (PG), and Mondelez (MDLZ). Both JNJ and PG stock could face margin pressure. It may have trouble passing inflationary input costs to its customers.

The firm still holds 915.6 million Apple (AAPL) shares. Berkshire appreciates the branding power and customer loyalty for Apple devices. Services, Apple Pay, and steaming content expand profit margins per user.

Berkshire's holdings of American Express (AXP), Apple, Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX) account for nearly 80% of the nearly $320 billion in assets managed. It is a good diversification of holdings exposed to credit, technology, banking, consumer goods, and energy.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/22/B_aff5fimage_story.jpg,False,@menafn,10.010055,280e2cf327a1a6dcc4d5757956391b72

What You Need To Know




Berkshire Fabric & Wallpaper will close its location on Wahconah Street in Pittsfield by Dec. 31 and transition to in-home services only




Donna Gopfert started the business with her late husband, David, in 2003




Gopfert will change the name to Berkshire Fabric, Blinds & Shades and no longer offer wallpaper




She said closing the retail store and focusing on in-home services will offer a more personalized experience for customers




 


Store founder and owner Donna Gopfert is in her second decade of transforming homes through her fabric and wallpaper business.


""It's been exciting watching the business evolve over the last 20 years,' she said.


Gopfert started Berkshire Fabric & Wallpaper with her late husband, David, in 2003.


'My husband and I bought out the contents of the Old Stone Mill in Adams along with the contents that they had up in their Kittery, Maine location,"" Gopfert said. ""We started off, we were only going to be here for a few months to liquidate the stock.'


A few months turned into 20 years of adding products and services from patio furniture upholstery to window treatments and shades. Gopfert said as times have changed, products have evolved.


'This whole section is indoor-outdoor,"" Gopfert said, walking through the store. ""Indoor-outdoor fabrics have changed now. What was traditionally an outdoor fabric can be used on any piece of furniture now. It's soft, it's subtle.'


So, Berkshire Fabric and Wallpaper is evolving as well. Gopfert will transition to in-home services only, closing the Pittsfield store at the end of the year - and she's changing the name.


'We are not closing, we are just closing the retail establishment,"" Gopfert said. ""The name change is due to the fact that I won't be having wallpaper. I am not going to be able to go to people's homes with 300 wallpaper books like I can with fabric samples and window treatment samples. Wallpaper has become something that a lot of people just shop for online. So, I'm eliminating that. So, the name will become Berkshire Fabric, Blinds & Shades.'


Gopfert said Berkshire Fabric, Blinds & Shades will grow with the industry, with the goal of helping people love their homes.",mynews13.com,9350,news,US,en,Dan Reidy,https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Berkshire_Fabric_MA_112123,False,,9.537193,b976917f636e7c1531f70af93bf46549

He would have turned 100 on Jan. 1.

'Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation,' Buffett said in a statement.

Munger grew up in Omaha, Nebraska and actually worked at a grocery store owned by Buffett's grandfather as a kid. However, the two legendary investors did not meet until 1959 at a dinner when Munger was back in Omaha to attend to matters related to his recently deceased father.

Prior to that, he had attended the University of Michigan, served in the Army Air Corps, and graduated from Harvard Law School. In 1962, he moved to California and founded a law firm, Munger, Tolles, and Olson, and spun off an investment firm, Wheeler, Munger and Co.

In an article he wrote for Columbia Business School Magazine in 1984 called'The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville,' Buffett highlighted Munger's track record running the portfolio at Wheeler, Munger.



'I ran into him in about 1960 and told him that law was fine as a hobby, but you can do better,' Buffett wrote of Munger.'His portfolio was concentrated in very few securities, and therefore, his record was much more volatile, but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration.'

As Buffett pointed out in the piece, Munger's portfolio had an average annual return of 19.8% from 1962 to 1975, compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gain of about 3% per year.

Sometime around 1976, Munger joined Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway , and in 1978, he became a vice chair, a position he held until he died. Incidentally, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has posted an average annual return of 19.8% per year from 1965 through 2022, compared to the S&P 500's 9.9% annual return over that same period.

When talking about Berkshire Hathaway and their strategy, Buffett typically says'Charlie and I,' which shows just how close a partnership these two men had. In the 2022 annual shareholders' letter, which came out this past February, Buffett did it multiple times. Among the many references, Buffett wrote,'Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.'

In fact, Buffett credits Munger with refocusing his investing strategy early on in their partnership , as he told CNBC in 2016.

'He weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,' Buffett told CNBC.

In the last letter to shareholders released in February, it was fitting that Buffett offered a tribute to Munger in a section called,'Nothing Beats Having a Great Partner.' You can find it on Berkshire Hathaway's website, but it seems appropriate to recount here today.

'Charlie and I think pretty much alike, but what it takes me a page to explain, he sums up in a sentence,' Buffett wrote.'His version, moreover, is always more clearly reasoned and also more artfully - some might add bluntly - stated. Here are a few of his thoughts, many lifted from a very recent podcast:



The world is full of foolish gamblers, and they will not do as well as the patient investor.

If you don't see the world the way it is, it's like judging something through a distorted lens.

All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there. And a related thought: Early on, write your desired obituary - and then behave accordingly.

If you don't care whether you are rational or not, you won't work on it. Then you will stay irrational and get lousy results.

Patience can be learned. Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one thing for a long time is a huge advantage.

You can learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest.

Don't bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy.

A great company keeps working after you are not; a mediocre company won't do that.

Warren and I don't focus on the froth of the market. We seek out good long-term investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time.

Ben Graham said, 'Day to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term, it's a weighing machine.' If you keep making something more valuable, then some wise person is going to notice it and start buying.

There is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing. Thus, the use of leverage is dangerous. A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero. Don't count on getting rich twice.

You don't, however, need to own a lot of things in order to get rich.

You have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor. When the world changes, you must change.

Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed, and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We were slow to recognize the change, but better late than never. Finally, I will add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for decades: 'Warren, think more about it. You're smart and I'm right.'

And so it goes. I never have a phone call with Charlie without learning something, and while he makes me think, he also makes me laugh.'

Buffett concluded the segment by writing:'I will add to Charlie's list a rule of my own: Find a very smart high-grade partner - preferably slightly older than you - and then listen very carefully to what he says.'",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2023-11/29/V_aed05image_story.jpeg,False,@menafn,20.331139,22b4c57ae040848d3c3508a30f90b5e3

Munger, a trained lawyer whose name still sits atop of Los Angeles law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, was instrumental in turning Berkshire into the investment powerhouse it is today.
Buffett, Berkshire's chief executive, said in a short statement that the company 'could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation'.
Munger was born on January 1 1924, to Alfred and Florence Munger in Omaha, Nebraska. A survivor of the Great Depression, he studied meteorology while serving in the Army during the second world war before graduating from Harvard Law School.
Munger first met Buffett in 1959, and the two became intellectual sparring partners even before they invested together.
In 1962, the same year Buffett started buying stock in the textile maker Berkshire Hathaway, Munger formed his law firm.
Buffett pushed Munger repeatedly to make the jump into the investment world, telling him at one point that 'law was fine as a hobby, but he could do better'. Munger eventually set up his own investment partnership known as Wheeler, Munger & Company, and his investment returns, like Buffett's, were stellar.
Munger joined Berkshire Hathaway in 1978. While he could come off as deferential to Buffett – he would often respond to investor questions at Berkshire annual meetings with a short 'I have nothing to add' after his partner had answered – Munger was often a driving force behind some of its investments.
He was consulted frequently on large takeovers, in some cases negotiating the details himself, according to people who sat across the table from him. His passions in engineering helped lead the company to its investment in Chinese carmaker BYD. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023",irishtimes.com,798,finance,IE,en,,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/-pX2vQmfMzWimn7PN4SXvnOTgMU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/2SZL5GDON6L64GO2Q6WRWHUT6U.jpg,False,@IrishTimes,19.345945,fe364cfd375ae5b5bbdc900d5573e067

Berkshire Hathaway confirmed Munger's peaceful passing, not disclosing the cause of death. The influential figure in the corporate and investment spheres would have celebrated his 100th birthday on January 1. Warren Buffett, Berkshire's 93-year-old chairman and CEO, expressed deep gratitude for Munger's contributions, emphasizing that Berkshire Hathaway wouldn't be what it is today without Munger's insights.



The relationship between Buffett and Munger was characterized by a deep intellectual connection. Buffett once referred to Munger as a ""thought partner,"" highlighting their uncanny similarity in thinking. The passing of Munger marks the end of an era in the United States' corporate and investment landscape.



Investors worldwide held both Munger and Buffett in high esteem, often attending Berkshire's annual conference in Omaha, Nebraska, to glean wisdom on both investing and life from the iconic duo. Munger, who served as vice chairman since 1978, was not only integral to Berkshire but also held roles as a real estate attorney, president, and publisher of the Daily Journal Corp., a board member of Costco, and an architect.



Munger's fortune, estimated at USD2.3 billion in early 2023, is substantial, yet pales in comparison to Buffett's wealth, exceeding USD100 billion. As the investment community reflects on Munger's impactful legacy, Berkshire Hathaway faces the challenge of navigating a future without the guidance of this revered figure.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_Entertainment_153.jpg,False,@menafn,17.545933,9ed78b797cb6103f6ffd3e8331ad0452

OMAHA, Neb. — Charlie Munger, who helped Warren Buffett build Berkshire Hathaway into an investment powerhouse, has died at a California hospital. He was 99.
 
Berkshire Hathaway said in a statement that Munger's family told the company that he died Tuesday morning at the hospital just over a month before his 100th birthday.
 
'Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation,' Buffett said in a statement.
 
Munger served as Buffett's sounding board on investments and business decisions and helped lead Berkshire for more than five decades and served as its longtime vice chairman.
 
Munger had been using a wheelchair to get around for several years but he had remained mentally sharp. That was on display while he fielded hours of questions at the annual meetings of Berkshire and the Daily Journal Corp. earlier this year, and in recent interviews on an investing podcast and also with The Wall Street Journal and CNBC.
 
Munger preferred to stay in the background and let Buffett be the face of Berkshire, and he often downplayed his contributions to the company's remarkable success.
 
But Buffett always credited Munger with pushing him beyond his early value investing strategies to buy great businesses at good prices like See's Candy.
 
'Charlie has taught me a lot about valuing businesses and about human nature,' Buffett said in 2008.
 
Buffett's early successes were based on what he learned from former Columbia University professor Ben Graham. He would buy stock in companies that were selling cheaply for less than their assets were worth, and then, when the market price improved, sell the shares.
 
Munger and Buffett began buying Berkshire Hathaway shares in 1962 for $7 and $8 per share, and they took control of the New England textile mill in 1965. Over time, the two men reshaped Berkshire into the conglomerate it is today by using proceeds from its businesses to buy other companies like Geico insurance and BNSF railroad, while also maintaining a high-profile stock portfolio with major investments in Apple and Coca-Cola. The shares have grown to $546,869 Tuesday, and many investors became wealthy by holding onto the stock.
 
Munger gave an extended interview to CNBC earlier this month in preparation for his 100th birthday, and the business network showed clips from that Tuesday. In his characteristic self-deprecating manner, Munger summed up the secret to Berkshire's success as avoiding mistakes and continuing to work well into his and Buffett's 90s.
 
'We got a little less crazy than most people and a little less stupid than most people and that really helped us,' Munger said.
 
During the entire time they worked together, Buffett and Munger lived more than 1,500 miles apart, but Buffett said he would call Munger in Los Angeles or Pasadena to consult on every major decision he made.
 
'He will be greatly missed by many, perhaps by nobody more than Mr. Buffett, who relied heavily on his wisdom and counsel. I was envious of their friendship. They challenged each other yet seemed to really enjoy being in each other's company,' Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said.
 
Munger grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, about five blocks away from Buffett's current home, but because Munger is seven years older the two men didn't meet as children, even though both worked at the grocery store Buffett's grandfather and uncle ran.
 
When the two men met in 1959 at an Omaha dinner party, Munger was practicing law in Southern California and Buffett was running an investment partnership in Omaha.
 
Buffett and Munger hit it off at that initial meeting and then kept in touch through frequent telephone calls and lengthy letters, according to the biography in the definitive book on Munger called 'Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger.'
 
The two men shared investment ideas and occasionally bought into the same companies during the 1960s and ‘70s. They became the two biggest shareholders in one of their common investments, trading stamp maker Blue Chip Stamp Co., and through that acquired See's Candy, the Buffalo News and Wesco. Munger became Berkshire's vice chairman in 1978, and chairman and president of Wesco Financial in 1984.
 
Berkshire's legions of devoted shareholders who regularly packed an Omaha arena to listen to the two men will remember the curmudgeonly quips Munger offered while answering questions alongside Buffett at the annual meetings.
 
Munger was known for repeating 'I have nothing to add' after many of Buffett's expansive answers at the Berkshire meetings. But Munger also often offered sharp answers that cut straight to the heart of an issue, such as the advice he offered in 2012 on spotting a good investment.
 
'If it's got a really high commission on it, don't bother looking at it,' he said.
 
Investor Whitney Tilson has attended the past 26 years of Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings for the chance to learn from Munger and Buffett, who doled out life lessons along with investing tips. Tilson said Munger advised that after achieving some success 'your whole approach to life should be how not to screw it up, how not to lose what you've got' because reputation and integrity are the most valuable assets, and both can be lost in a heartbeat.
 
'In the investment world, it's the same thing is in your personal world, which is your main goal should be avoiding the catastrophic mistakes that could destroy an investment record, that can destroy a life,' Tilson said.
 
Munger was known as a voracious reader and a student of human behavior. He employed a variety of different models borrowed from disciplines like psychology, physics and mathematics to evaluate potential investments.
 
Munger studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in the 1940s, but dropped out of college to serve as a meteorologist in the  Air Corps during World War II.
 
Then he went on to earn a law degree from Harvard University in 1948 even though he hadn't finished a bachelor's degree.
 
Munger built a fortune worth more than $2 billion at one point and earned a spot on the list of the richest Americans. Munger's wealth decreased over time as he gave more of his fortune away, but the ever increasing value of Berkshire's stock kept him wealthy.
 
Munger has given significant gifts to Harvard-Westlake, Stanford University Law School, the University of Michigan and the Huntington Library as well as other charities. He also gave a significant portion of his Berkshire stock to his eight children after his wife died in 2010.
 
Munger also served on the boards of Good Samaritan Hospital and the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles.

Berkshire Hathaway officially confirmed Munger's demise, acknowledging his profound impact on the company's success.



In a statement, Warren Buffett expressed deep gratitude for Munger's invaluable contributions, emphasizing that Berkshire Hathaway's current stature would not have been attainable without Munger's inspiration, wisdom, and active involvement. Buffett dedicated a portion of his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders earlier this year to pay tribute to Munger, underscoring the significance of their partnership.



Munger played a pivotal role as Buffett's confidant, offering insights on investment strategies and key business decisions. His leadership spanned over five decades, during which he served as Berkshire's longtime vice chairman. Despite relying on a wheelchair for mobility in recent years, Munger maintained mental acuity, evident in his extensive interactions during annual meetings and interviews with various media outlets, including an investing podcast, The Wall Street Journal, and CNBC.

94,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway says Haslams offered bribes to inflate Pilot truck stops earnings,Associated Press,2023-11-29 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/11/29/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-says-haslams-offered-bribes-to-inflate-pilot-truck-stops-earnings,ny1.com,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway says the billionaire Haslam family tried to bribe at least 15 executives at the Pilot truck stop chain with millions of dollars to get them to inflate the company's…,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway says the billionaire Haslam family tried to bribe at least 15 executives at the Pilot truck stop chain with millions of dollars to get them to inflate the company's profits this year because that would force Berkshire to pay more for the Haslams' remaining 20% stake in the company. 
 
The Berkshire claim in a counter lawsuit filed this week comes after the Haslam family — which includes Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and former Tennessee governor Bill Haslam — 
accused Berkshire
 of trying to understate Pilot's earnings this year by changing its accounting practices.
 
A hearing on Berkshire's counter lawsuit is planned for Thursday. The Haslams' lawyers and a representative for the family didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
 
Berkshire said in a court filing that it only became aware this month of the Haslams' attempts to bribe executives who used to work for the family at the company Jim Haslam — Jimmy and Bill Haslam's father — founded before Berkshire became the majority owner at the start of this year. A senior executive who had been promised a bonus revealed that to the current Pilot CEO, who Berkshire appointed after it took over, according to the filing.
 
Berkshire said Jimmy Haslam offered to personally pay bonuses to the executives that would far exceed their annual salaries based on the price the family received for its remaining stake. Berkshire redacted the number of employees it believes agreed to accept bonuses, but it said Haslam made the offer to about 15 employees at a country club dinner in Knoxville, Tennessee, in March and repeated that offer to at least four other high-level executives. Pilot's former CEO also extended the offer of under-the-table payments to at least 10 other executives in April, according to Berkshire's filing.
 
It's not clear exactly how much money is at stake because some of the figures in the lawsuits have also been redacted, but the Haslams said their 20% stake in Pilot was believed to be worth $3.2 billion before the accounting change Berkshire made.
 
The price Berkshire will eventually pay when the Haslams decide to sell their remaining stake is determined by a formula based on Pilot's reported earnings that Buffett and the family agreed to in 2017.
 
Berkshire initially bought 38.6% of Pilot back then for $2.758 billion before more than doubling that to 80% this year for an additional $8.2 billion. Buffett told 
Berkshire shareholders
 this spring that he wishes he could have bought the entire company at once because the price was better in 2017, but the Haslams wouldn't sell it all then.
 
Pilot is the nation's largest network of truck stops with more than 850 locations and roughly 30,000 employees in the United States and Canada. It has already provided a 
meaningful boost
 to Berkshire's revenue and profits this year.
 
The Haslams said Berkshire's decision to shift to something called 'pushdown accounting' this year forced Pilot to take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and that resulted in lower net income. The Haslams were outvoted on that change at Pilot board meetings.
 
Berkshire said it's impossible to calculate how much Pilot's profits may have been inflated this year because of decisions executives who were promised bonuses made. It said some recommendations to sell off assets or abandon valuable hedge positions to boost short-term profits were rejected but other decisions likely went undetected.
 
Berkshire is asking for a January trial date so its claims can be judged alongside the Haslam's initial lawsuit to help determine the proper value of Pilot and whether the Haslams should be allowed to sell their stake in 2024 when there are so many questions about whether the company's 2023 earnings are proper.
 
Besides the truck stops, Berkshire owns dozens of other businesses including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad and several major utilities along with an assortment of smaller manufacturing and retail businesses. It also holds a 
sizeable stock portfolio
 with big stakes in Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express and Bank of America among other holdings.

Munger famously summed that advice up humorously by saying, 'All I want to know is where I'm going to die so (that) I never go there.'

Munger was known as a voracious reader and a student of human behavior. He employed a variety of different models borrowed from disciplines like psychology, physics and mathematics to evaluate potential investments.

Munger studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in the 1940s, but dropped out of college to serve as a meteorologist in the Army Air Corps during World War II.

Then he went on to earn a law degree from Harvard University in 1948 even though he hadn't finished an undergraduate degree. He co-founded a law firm in Los Angeles that still bears his name but decided before long that he preferred investing.

Munger built a fortune worth more than $2 billion at one point and earned a spot on the list of the richest Americans. Munger's wealth decreased over time as he gave more of his fortune away, but the ever-increasing value of Berkshire's stock kept him wealthy.

Munger has given significant gifts to Harvard-Westlake, Stanford University Law School, the University of Michigan and the Huntington Library as well as other charities. He also gave a significant portion of his Berkshire stock to his eight children after his wife died in 2010.

Munger also served on the boards of Good Samaritan Hospital and the private Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. Munger served on the board of Costco Wholesale Corp. and for years as chairman of the Daily Journal Corp.",newindianexpress.com,3045,business,IN,en,Associated Press,https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2023/11/29/w600X390/Charlie_Munger.jpg,False,@newindianexpress.com,15.6812935,1e54dbd3ef8be205955961e3559a5eb8

However, Berkshire will retain the option to raise these concerns in the upcoming trial in January, where a judge will evaluate the Haslams' counterclaim that Berkshire attempted to depress earnings at the truck stop chain.



The dispute revolves around accusations from both parties that each sought to manipulate profits at the nation's largest truck stop chain. The financial figures are crucial as they will determine the amount Berkshire Hathaway must pay if the Haslam family decides to sell its remaining 20 percent stake in the business next year, in accordance with the agreement reached in 2017 when the family sold a portion of the business. The pricing is based on the earnings of the truck stop chain.



The Haslam family contends that Berkshire is suppressing earnings through an accounting change at Pilot. In response, Berkshire alleges that Jimmy Haslam, owner of the Cleveland Browns and part of the Haslam family, attempted to bribe executives at the truck stop chain to inflate earnings. The Haslam family includes Jimmy Haslam, former Tennessee governor Bill Haslam, and their father, who founded the company.



A Delaware judge has already scheduled a two-day trial in January to address the Haslams' allegations regarding the accounting change. However, the judge proposed that if Berkshire wished to have a verdict on its bribery claims concurrently, the company would need to forgo requesting additional evidence beforehand and limit the number of witnesses it plans to call.



The outcome of the January trial will determine when Berkshire's bribery allegations will be addressed in subsequent legal proceedings, adding complexity to an already intricate legal battle between the two parties.",menafn.com,6165,news,US,en,MENAFN,https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images/Local_Politics_894.jpg,False,@menafn,17.953943,50cb863992b518161d0b7f7711cdcf9c

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.96% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 2, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

100,Berkshire can't use bribery allegations against Haslam in Pilot truck stop chain accounting dispute,Associated Press,2023-12-13 00:00:00,date,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2023/12/13/berkshire-cant-use-bribery-allegations-against-haslam-in-pilot-truck-stop-chain-accounting-dispute,ny1.com,A Delaware judge says Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will not be allowed to use allegations that billionaire Jimmy Haslam tried to bribe employees at the Pilot truck stop chain as Berkshire…,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will not be allowed to use allegations that billionaire Jimmy Haslam 
tried to bribe employees
 at the Pilot truck stop chain to inflate the company's value as Berkshire defends itself in a dispute over the company's accounting practices, a Delaware judge said Wednesday.
 
The ruling came in a lawsuit in which Pilot Corp. claims that Berkshire Hathaway, which holds 80% of Pilot Travel Centers, has used accounting changes to try to artificially depress the price Berkshire would have to pay for the Haslam family's remaining 20% stake in the truck-stop chain.
 
Berkshire responded to the lawsuit by claiming that Jimmy Haslam, the owner of the Cleveland Browns, tried to bribe more than two dozen Pilot employees to get them to inflate the company's profits this year. Berkshire alleges that Haslam wanted to artificially inflate profits so Berkshire would have to pay more for the remaining stake in Pilot held by the Haslam family, which also includes former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam.
 
Following a hearing Wednesday, Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn ruled that Berkshire could not use the bribery allegations as part of an 'unclean hands' defense at an 
expedited trial next month
. She also said any related depositions would not be allowed, noting that the bribery allegations do not have an 'immediate and proper nexus' to Pilot's underlying claims.
 
While granting Pilot's motions to restrict Berkshire's defenses, Zurn also indicated that she may deny Berkshire's request to amend its answers and defenses. Among the new information Berkshire wants to use are allegations that Pilot's controller, David Clothier, used his spouse's cell phone to secretly communicate with Haslam, was offered an illicit payment by Haslam, and tried to retroactively alter financial statements to change or delete references to the accounting changes.
 
Meanwhile, an attorney for Pilot told Zurn that federal prosecutors have begun an investigation based on Berkshire's bribery allegations.
 
'We have no reason to believe that that investigation is going to impede the progress of this case,' said attorney Bradley Wilson. Wilson noted, however, that Pilot was asked to postpone some depositions in the case in order to allow people to hire lawyers.
 
Pilot alleges that, after taking control of the company, Berkshire adopted 'pushdown accounting,' which forced Pilot to take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and resulted in lower net income. Pilot claims that a 2017 LLC agreement prevents Berkshire from making such an accounting change without Pilot's consent.
 
In an effort to resolve the dispute Jimmy Haslam and his father, Pilot founder Jim Haslam, presented a resolution to the board in August but were outvoted by the five Berkshire members of the board. 
 
Berkshire bought 38.6% of Pilot in 2017 for $2.76 billion before more than doubling that to 80% this year for an additional $8.2 billion.
 
Under an investor rights agreement with Berkshire, the Haslams have an annual option, starting Jan. 1, 2024, to sell their remaining 20% interest in Pilot to Berkshire. The agreement gives the Haslams 60 days from the start of each year to make that decision, meaning they must decide by Feb. 29 whether to exercise the option.
 
Pilot argues that with the first opportunity to exercise the sell option just weeks away, Berkshire has used accounting changes to try to lower the price it would have to pay for the Haslams' remaining stake.
 
Besides the truck stops, Berkshire owns dozens of other businesses including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad and several major utilities along with an assortment of smaller manufacturing and retail businesses. It also holds a 
sizeable stock portfolio
 with big stakes in Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express and Bank of America among other holdings.

VNA nurses and healthcare professionals have had tremendous community support during their first contract negotiations, and reached a tentative contract agreement December 15

PITTSFIELD, Mass., Dec. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The nurses and healthcare professionals of the Berkshire Visiting Nurse Association (BVNA), represented by the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA), reached a tentative agreement on December 15 with Berkshire Health Systems, agreeing on contract terms that give BVNA clinicians a wage step scale and tackle some productivity issues to help with recruitment and retention and address patient care access problems.

The agreement is tentative until BVNA clinicians represented by the MNA can review the terms this week. A vote to ratify the contract is scheduled for December 22.

""We have fought long and hard for this contract because we care deeply about our patients and their ability to receive high-quality homecare throughout Berkshire County,"" said Tamaryn Clowdus, physical therapist, and Co-Chair of the MNA Bargaining Committee at Berkshire VNA. ""Our collective strength as union nurses and healthcare professionals, along with the community and our labor supporters, was essential in helping us reach an agreement. We are pleased to have secured a wage step scale, productivity improvements, and many other contract provisions that will benefit clinicians and patients for years to come.""

Berkshire VNA clinicians had been negotiating their first contract after initially forming a union two years ago. The tentative agreement followed a December 4 informational picket well-attended by community supporters. The informational picket was the latest in a series of actions by BVNA nurses and healthcare professionals. In October, the clinicians delivered a petition to BHS CEO

Darlene M. Rodowicz emphasizing the fact that the BVNA has experienced a significant loss of permanent staff since at least December 2021, destabilizing homecare service access and posing a serious risk to continuity of patient care.

In May, BVNA nurses and healthcare professionals held a virtual community forum on the changing state of home care. In April, they delivered a petition signed by community members urging BHS to move quickly to settle a fair contract. BVNA registered nurses, MSWs, and physical, occupational and speech therapists joined MNA in December 2021 following an election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board.

The medical needs of Berkshire VNA patients are varied and complex, including post-surgical conditions such as total hip or total knee replacements; stroke; Parkinson's Disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); cardiopulmonary conditions; amputations; and post-trauma care (breaks, fractures). In recent years, many hospital-based services for patients have shifted to in-home services, making VNAs and their caregivers an essential and ever-expanding part of the healthcare system. Hospitals now move patients back home faster, leading to a dramatic increase in the size and complexity of the region's at-home patient population.
